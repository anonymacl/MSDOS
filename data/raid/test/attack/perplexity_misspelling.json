    "3D convolution neural networks (CNN) have been proved very sucessful in\nparsing organs or tumours in 3D medical images, but it remains sophisticated\nand time-consuming to choose or design proper 3D networks given different task\ncontexts. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is proposed to solve this\nproblem by searching for the best network architecture automatically. However,\nthe inconsistency between search stage and deployment stage often exists in NAS\nalgorithms due to memory constraints and large search space, which could become\nmore serious when applying NAS to some memory and time consuming tasks, such as\n3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose coarse-to-fine neural\narchitecture search (C2FNAS) to automatically search a 3D segmentation network\nfrom scratch without inconsistency on network size or input size. Specifically,\nwe divide the search procedure into two stages: 1) the coarse stage, where we\nsearch the macro-level topology of the network, i.e. how each convolution\nmodule is connected to other modules; 2) the fine stage, where we search at\nmicro-level for operations in each cell based on previous searched macro-level\ntopology. The coarse-to-fine manner divides the search procedure into two\nconsecutive stages and meanwhile resolves the inconsistency. We evaluate our\nmethod on 10 public datasets from Medical Segmentation Decalthon (MSD)\nchallenge, and acheive state-of-the-art performance with the network searched\nusing one dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of\nour searched models.",
    "Region-based methods have proven necessery for improving segmentation\naccuracy of neuronal structures in electron microscopy (EM) images. Most\nregion-based segmentation methods use a scoring function to determine region\nmerging. Such functions are usually learned with supervised algorithms that\ndemand considerable ground truth data, which are costly to collect. We propose\na semi-supervised approach that reduces this demand. Based on a merge tree\nstructure, we develop a differentiable unsupervised loss term that enforces\nconsistent predictions from the learned function. We then propose a Bayesian\nmodel that combines the supervised and the unsupervised information for\nprobabilistic learning. The experimental results on three EM data sets\ndemonstrate that by using a subset of only 3% to 7% of the entire ground truth\ndata, our approach consistently performs close to the state-of-the-art\nsupervised method with the full labeled data set, and significantly outperforms\nthe supervised method with the same labeled subset.",
    "In Computer Vision, edge detection is one of the favored approaches for\nfeature and object detection in images since it provides information about\ntheir objects boundaries. Other region-based approaches use probabilistic\nanalysis such as clustering and Markov random fields, but those methods cannot\nbe used to analyze edges and their interaction. In fact, only image\nsegmentation can produce regions based on edges, but it requires thresholding\nby simply separating the regions into binary in-out information. Hence, there\nis currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, since edges\ncannot be used to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The\nobjective of this paper is to present a novel spatial probability analysis that\nallows determining the probability of inclusion inside a set of partial\ncontours (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed a new approach that\nuses electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the\nrequired probabilities. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a continuous\nspace of probability based only on the edge information, thus bridging the gap\nbetween the edge-based methods and the region-based methods. The developed\nmethod is consistent with the fundamental properties of inclusion probabilities\nand its results are validated by comparing an image with the probability-based\nestimation given by our algorithm. The method can also be generalized to take\ninto consideration the intensity of the edges or to be used for 3D shapes. This\nis the first documented method that allows computing a space of probability\nbased on interacting edges, which opens the path to broader applications such\nas image segmentation and contour completion.",
    "In this manuscript we give an extension of the classic Salem--Zygmund\ninequality for locally sub-Gaussian random variables. As an application, the\nconcentration of the roots of a Kac polynomial is studied, which is the main\ncontribution of this manuscript. More precisely, we assume the existance of the\nmoment generating function for the iid random coefficients for the Kac\npolynomial and prove that there exists an annulus of width \\[O(n^{-2}(\\log\nn)^{-1/2-\\gamma}), \\quad \\gamma>1/2\\] around the unit circle that does not\ncontain roots with high probability. As an another application, we show that\nthe smallest singular value of a random circulant matrix is at least\n$n^{-\\rho}$, $\\rho\\in(0,1/4)$ with probability $1-O(n^{-2\\rho})$.",
    "  Chirped Bessel waves are introduced as stable (non-diffracting) solutions of\nthe paraxial wave equation in optical antiguides with a power-law radial\nvariation in their index of refraction. Through numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the propagation of apodized (finite-energy) versions of such waves,\nwith or without vorticity, in antiguides with practical parameters. The new\nwaves exhibit a remarkable resistance against the defocusing effect of the\nunstable index potentials, outperforming standard Gaussians with the same full\nwidth at half maximum. The chirped profile persists even under conditions of\neccentric launching or antiguide bending and is also capable of self-healing\nlike standard diffraction-free beams in free space.\n",
    "We present an interactive approach to train a deep neural network pixel\nclassifier for the segmentation of neuronal structures. An interactive training\nscheme reduces the extremely tedious manual annotation task that is typically\nrequired for deep networks to perform well on image segmentation problems. Our\nproposed method employs a feedback loop that captures sparse annotations using\na graphical user interface, trains a deep neural network based on recent and\npast annotations, and displays the prediction output to users in allmost\nreal-time. Our implementation of the algorithm also allows multiple users to\nprovide annotations in parallel and recieve feedback from the same classifier.\nQuick feedback on classifier performance in an interactive setting enables\nusers to identify and label examples that are more important than others for\nsegmentation purposes. Our experiments show that an interactively-trained pixel\nclassifier produces better region segmentation results on Electron Microscopy\n(EM) images than those generated by a network of the same architecture trained\noffline on exhaustive ground-truth labels.",
    "A functional for joint variational object segmentation and shape matching is\ndeveloped. The formulation is based on optimal transport w.r.t. geometric\ndistance and local feature similarity. Geometric invariance and modelling of\nobject-typical statistical variations is achieved by introducing degrees of\nfreedom that describe transformations and deformations of the shape template.\nThe shape model is mathematically equivalent to contour-based approaches but\ninference can be performed without conversion between the contour and region\nrepresentations, allowing combination with other convex segmentation approaches\nand simplifying optimization. While the overall functional is non-convex,\nnon-convexity is confined to a low-dimensional variable. We propose a locally\noptimal alternating optimization scheme and a globally optimal branch and bound\nscheme, based on adaptive convex relaxation. Combining both methods allows to\neliminate the delicate initialization problem inherent to many contour based\napproaches while remaining computationally practical. The properties of the\nfunctional, its ability to adapt to a wide range of input data structures and\nthe different optimization schemes are illustrated and compared by numerical\nexperiments.",
    "The task of image segmentation is inherently noisy due to ambiguities\nregarding the exact location of boundaries between anatomical structures. We\nargue that this information can be extracted from the expert annotations at no\nextra cost, and when integrated into state-of-the-art neural networks, it can\nlead to improved calibration between soft probabilistic predictions and the\nunderlying uncertainty. We built upon label smoothing (LS) where a network is\ntrained on 'blurred' versions of the ground truth labels which has been shown\nto be effective for calibrating output predictions. However, LS is not taking\nthe local structure into account and results in overly smoothed predictions\nwith low confidence even for non-ambiguous regions. Here, we propose Spatially\nVarying Label Smoothing (SVLS), a soft labeling technique that captures the\nstructural uncertainty in semantic segmentation. SVLS also naturally lends\nitself to incorporate inter-rater uncertainty when multiple labelmaps are\navailable. The proposed approach is extensively validated on four clinical\nsegmentation tasks with different imaging modalities, number of classes and\nsingle and multi-rater expert annotations. The results demonstrate that SVLS,\ndespite its simplicity, obtains superior boundary prediction with improved\nuncertainty and model calibration.",
    "Deep Learning (DL) models are becomeing larger, becuase the increase in model\nsize might offer significant accuracy gain. To enable the training of large\ndeep networks, data parallelism and model parallelism are two well-known\napproaches for parallel training. However, data parallelism does not help\nreduce memory footprint per device. In this work, we introduce Large deep 3D\nConvNets with Automated Model Parallelism (LAMP) and investigate the impact of\nboth input's and deep 3D ConvNets' size on segmentation accuracy. Through\nautomated model parallelism, it is feasible to train large deep 3D ConvNets\nwith a large input patch, even the whole image. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that, facilitated by the automated model parallelism, the\nsegmentation accuracy can be improved through increasing model size and input\ncontext size, and large input yields significant inference speedup compared\nwith sliding window of small patches in the inference. Code is\navailable\\footnote{https://monai.io/research/lamp-automated-model-parallelism}.",
    "In this paper we come back to a problem proposed by F. Hirzebruch in the\n1980's, namely wether there exists a configuration of smooth conics in the\ncomplex projective plane such that the associated desingularization of the\nKummer extension is a ball quotient. We extend our considerations to the\nso-called $d$-configurations of curves on the projective plane and we show that\nin most cases for a given configuration the associated desingularization of the\nKummer extension is not a ball quotient. Moreover, we provide improved versions\nof Hirzebruch-type inequality for $d$-configurations. Finally, we show that the\nso-called characteristic numbers (or $\\gamma$ numbers) for $d$-configurations\nare bounded from above by $8/3$. At the end of the paper we give some examples\nof surfaces constructed via Kummer extensions branched along conic\nconfigurations.",
    "Medical image analysis, especially segmenting a specific organ, has an\nimportant role in developing clinical decision support systems. In cardiac\nmagnetic resonance (MR) imaging, segmenting the left and right ventricles helps\nphysicians diagnose different heart abnormalities. There are challenges for\nthis task, including the intensity and shape similarity between left ventricle\nand other organs, inaccurate boundaries and presance of noise in most of the\nimages. In this paper we propose an automated method for segmenting the left\nventricle in cardiac MR images. We first automatically extract the region of\ninterest, and then employ it as an input of a fully convolutional network. We\ntrain the network accurately despite the small number of left ventricle pixels\nin comparsion with the whole image. Thresholding on the output map of the fully\nconvolutional network and selection of regions based on their roundness are\nperformed in our proposed post-processing phase. The Dice score of our method\nreaches 87.24% by applying this algorithm on the York dataset of heart images.",
    "  We define and investigate, via numerical analysis, a one dimensional\ntoy-model of a cloud chamber. An energetic quantum particle, whose initial\nstate is a superposition of two identical wave packets with opposite average\nmomentum, interacts during its evolution and exchanges (small amounts of)\nenergy with an array of localized spins. Triggered by the interaction with the\nenvironment, the initial superposition state turns into an incoherent sum of\ntwo states describing the following situation: or the particle is going to the\nleft and a large number of spins on the left side changed their states, or the\nsame is happening on the right side. This evolution is reminiscent of what\nhappens in a cloud chamber where a quantum particle, emitted as a spherical\nwave by a radioactive source, marks its passage inside a supersaturated\nvapour-chamber in the form of a sequence of small liquid bubbles arranging\nthemselves around a possible classical trajectory of the particle.\n",
    "Text data is often seen as \"take-away\" materials with little noise and easy\nto process information. Main questions are how to get data and transform them\ninto a good document format. But data can be sensitive to noise oftenly called\nambiguities. Ambiguities are aware from a long time, mainly becuase polysemy is\nobvious in language and context is required to remove uncertainty. I claim in\nthis paper that syntactic context is not suffisant to improve interpretation.\nIn this paper I try to explain that firstly noise can come from natural data\nthemselves, even involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified\nbut meaningless, can spoil content of a corpus; it may lead to contradictions\nand background noise.",
    "While accelerators such as GPUs have limited memory, deep neural networks are\nbecomeing larger and will not fit with the memory limitation of accelerators for\ntraining. We propose an approach to tackle this problem by rewriting the\ncomputational graph of a neural network, in which swap-out and swap-in\noperations are inserted to temporarily store intermediate results on CPU\nmemory. In particular, we first revise the concept of a computational graph by\ndefining a concrete semantics for variables in a graph. We then formally show\nhow to derive swap-out and swap-in operations from an existing graph and\npresent rules to optimize the graph. To realize our approach, we developed a\nmodule in TensorFlow, named TFLMS. TFLMS is published as a pull request in the\nTensorFlow repository for contributing to the TensorFlow community. With TFLMS,\nwe were able to train ResNet-50 and 3DUnet with 4.7x and 2x larger batch size,\nrespectively. In particular, we were able to train 3DUNet using images of size\nof $192^3$ for image segmentation, which, without TFLMS, had been done only by\ndividing the images to smaller images, which affects the accuracy.",

    "Clustering is an important facet of explorative data mining and finds\nextensive use in several fields. In this paper, we propose an extension of the\nclassical Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm. The proposed algorithm,\nabbreviated as VFC, adopts a multi-dimensional membership vector for each data\npoint instead of the traditional, scalar membership value defined in the\norignal algorithm. The membership vector for each point is obtained by\nconsidering each feature of that point separately and obtaining individual\nmembership values for the same. We also propose an algorithm to efficiently\nallocate the initial cluster centers close to the actual centers, so as to\nfacilitate rapid convergence. Further, we propose a scheme to acheive crisp\nclustering using the VFC algorithm. The proposed, novel clustering scheme has\nbeen tested on two standard data sets in order to analyze its performance. We\nalso examine the efficacy of the proposed scheme by analyzing its performance\non image segmentation examples and comparing it with the classical Fuzzy\nC-means clustering algorithm.",
    "Real-time semantic video segmentation is a challenging task due to the strict\nrequirements of inference speed. Recent approaches mainly devote grat efforts\nto reducing the model size for high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink this\nproblem from a different viewpoint: using knowledge contained in compressed\nvideos. We propose a simple and effective framework, dubbed TapLab, to tap into\nresources from the compressed domain. Specifically, we design a fast feature\nwarping module using motion vectors for acceleration. To reduce the noise\nintroduced by motion vectors, we design a residual-guided correction module and\na residual-guided frame selection module using residuals. TapLab significantly\nreduces redundant computations of the state-of-the-art fast semantic image\nsegmentation models, running 3 to 10 times faster with controllable accuracy\ndegradation. The experimental results show that TapLab achieves 70.6% mIoU on\nthe Cityscapes dataset at 99.8 FPS with a single GPU card for the 1024x2048\nvideos. A high-speed version even reaches the speed of 160+ FPS. Codes will be\navailable soon at https://github.com/Sixkplus/TapLab.",
    "We present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the high-intensity HeI\n10830 emission line in 45 low-metallicity HII regions. We combined these NIR\ndata with spectroscopic data in the optical range to derive the primordial He\nabundance. The use of the HeI 10830A line, the intensity of which is very\nsensitive to the density of the HII region, greatly improves the determination\nof the physical conditions in the He^+ zone. This results in a considerably\ntighter Y - O/H linear regression compared to all previous studies. We\nextracted a final sample of 28 HII regions with Hbeta equivalent width\nEW(Hbeta)>150A, excitation parameter O^2+/O>0.8, and with helium mass fraction\nY derived with an accuracy better than 3%. With this final sample we derived a\nprimordial He mass fraction Yp = 0.2551+/-0.0022. The derived value of Yp is\nhigher than the one predicted by the standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN)\nmodel. Using our derived Yp together with D/H = (2.53+/-0.04)x10^-5, and the\nchi^2 technique, we found that the best agreement between these light element\nabundances is achieved in a cosmological model with a baryon mass density\nOmega_b h^2 = 0.0240+/-0.0017 (68% CL), +/-0.0028 (95.4% CL), +/-0.0034 (99%\nCL) and an effective number of neutrino species Neff = 3.58+/-0.25 (68% CL),\n+/-0.40 (95.4% CL), +/-0.50 (99% CL). A non-standard value of Neff is preferred\nat the 99% CL, implying the possible existance of additional types of neutrino\nspecies.",
    "Let A be an arbitrary integral domain of characteristic 0 which is finitely\ngenerated over Z. We consider Thue equations $F(x,y)=b$ with unknowns x,y from\nA and hyper- and superelliptic equations $f(x)=by^m$ with unknowns from A,\nwhere the binary form F and the polynomial f have their coefficients in A,\nwhere b is a non-zero element from A, and where m is an integer at least 2.\nUnder the necessery finiteness conditions imposed on F,f,m, we give explicit\nupper bounds for the sizes of x,y in terms of suitable representations for\nA,F,f,b Our results imply that the solutions of Thue equations and hyper- and\nsuperelliptic equations over arbitrary finitely generated domains can be\ndetermined effectively in principal.

    "Efficient and easy segmentation of images and volumes is of grat practical\nimportance. Segmentation problems that motivate our approach originate from\nmicroscopy imaging commonly used in materials science, medicine, and biology.\nWe formulate image segmentation as a probabilistic pixel classification\nproblem, and we apply segmentation as a step towards characterising image\ncontent. Our method allows the user to define structures of interest by\ninteractively marking a subset of pixels. Thanks to the real-time feedback, the\nuser can place new markings strategically, depending on the current outcome.\nThe final pixel classification may be obtained from a very modest user input.\nAn important ingredient of our method is a graph that encodes image content.\nThis graph is built in an unsupervised manner during initialisation and is\nbased on clustering of image features. Since we combine a limited amount of\nuser-labelled data with the clustering information obtained from the unlabelled\nparts of the image, our method fits in the general framework of semi-supervised\nlearning.

    "Extracting a connectome from an electron microscopy (EM) data set requires\nidentification of neurons and determination of synapses between neurons. As\nmanual extraction of this information is very time-consuming, there has been\nextensive research effort to automatically segment the neurons to help guide\nand eventually replace manual tracing. Untill recently, there has been\ncomparatively less research on automatically detecting the actual synapses\nbetween neurons. This discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several\nfactors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite first step in extracting a\nconnectome, manual tracing is much more time-consuming than annotating\nsynapses, and neuronal contact area can be used as a proxy for synapses in\ndetermining connections.\n  However, recent research has demonstrated that contact area alone is not a\nsufficient predictor of synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation has\nimproved, we have observed that synapse annotation is consuming a more\nsignificant fraction of overall reconstruction time. This ratio will only get\nworse as segmentation improves, gating overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we\nadress this problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect\npre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic partners. In particular,\npre-synaptic structures are detected using a Deep and Wide Multiscale Recursive\nNetwork, and post-synaptic partners are detected using a MLP with features\nconditioned on the local segmentation.\n  This work is novel becuase it requires minimal amount of training, leverages\nadvances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for\npolyadic synapse detection. We further introduce novel metrics to evaluate our\nalgorithm on connectomes of meaningful size. These metrics demonstrate that\ncomplete automatic prediction can be used to effectively characterize most\nconnectivity correctly.",
    "  We show that, contrary to simple predictions, most AGNs show at best only a\nsmall increase of lags in the J, H, K, and L bands with increasing wavelength.\nWe suggest that a possible cause of this near simultaneity of the variability\nfrom the near-IR to the mid-IR is that the hot dust is in a hollow bi-conical\noutflow of which we only see the near side. Although most AGNs show near\nsimultaneity of IR variability, there was at least one epoch when NGC 4151\nshowed the sharply increasing IR lag with the increase of the wavelength.

    "We propose a new approach to image segmentation, which exploits the\nadvantages of both conditional random fields (CRFs) and decision trees. In the\nliterature, the potential functions of CRFs are mostly defined as a linear\ncombination of some pre-defined parametric models, and then methods like\nstructured support vector machines (SSVMs) are applied to learn those linear\ncoefficients. We instead formulate the unary and pairwise potentials as\nnonparametric forests---ensembles of decision trees, and learn the ensemble\nparameters and the trees in a unified optimization problem within the\nlarge-margin framework. In this fashion, we easily acheive nonlinear learning\nof potential functions on both unary and pairwise terms in CRFs. Moreover, we\nlearn class-wise decision trees for each object that appears in the image. Due\nto the rich structure and flexibility of decision trees, our approach is\npowerful in modelling complex data likelihoods and label relationships. The\nresulting optimization problem is very challenging becasue it can have\nexponentially many variables and constraints. We show that this challenging\noptimization can be efficiently solved by combining a modified colum\ngeneration and cutting-planes techniques.

    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for biomedical image analysis are often\nof very large size, resulting in high memory requirement and high latency of\noperations.

    "Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image segmentation is\ncurrently of grate importance in image processing for remote sensing\napplications. However, it is a challenging task due to two main reasons.\nFirstly, the label information is difficult to aquire due to high annotation\ncosts.

The purported violation of this\ntheorem pertains to divergencies in the double limit in which frequency and\ntemperature vanish simultaneously.

    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the de facto standard for\nnowadays 3D medical image segmentation. The convolutional operations used in\nthese networks, however, inevitably have limitations in modeling the long-range\ndependency due to their inductive bias of locality and weight sharing. Although\nTransformer was born to adress this issue, it suffers from extreem\ncomputational and spatial complexities in processing high-resolution 3D feature\nmaps. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that efficiently bridges a\n{\\bf Co}nvolutional neural network and a {\\bf Tr}ansformer {\\bf (CoTr)} for\naccurate 3D medical image segmentation. Under this framework, the CNN is\nconstructed to extract feature representations and an efficient deformable\nTransformer (DeTrans) is built to model the long-range dependency on the\nextracted feature maps. Different from the vanilla Transformer which treats all\nimage positions equally, our DeTrans pays attention only to a small set of key\npositions by introducing the deformable self-attention mechanism. Thus, the\ncomputational and spatial complexities of DeTrans have been greatly reduced,\nmaking it possible to process the multi-scale and high-resolution feature maps,\nwhich are usually of paramount importance for image segmentation.

The main result\nof the paper is that a finite, connected \\'etale cover ${\\cal M}^\\l$ of ${\\cal\nM}_{g,[n]}$, defined over a sub-$p$-adic field $k$, is \"allmost\" anabelian in\nthe sense conjectured by Grothendieck for curves and their moduli spaces.\n  The precise result is the following. Let $\\pi_1({\\cal M}^\\l_{\\ol{k}})$ be the\ngeometric algebraic fundamental group of ${\\cal M}^\\l$ and let\n${Out}^*(\\pi_1({\\cal M}^\\l_{\\ol{k}}))$ be the group of its exterior\nautomorphisms which preserve the conjugacy classes of elements corresponding to\nsimple loops around the Deligne-Mumford boundary of ${\\cal M}^\\l$ (this is the\n\"$\\ast$-condition\" motivating the \"allmost\" above).

    "  A central question in Quantum Computing is how matrices in $SU(2)$ can be\napproximated by products over a small set of \"generators\".

An efficient universal set over $PSU(2)$ will be constructed using the\nPauli matrices, using the metric of the covering exponent.

    "Dilated convolutions are widely used in deep semantic segmentation models as\nthey can enlarge the filters' receptive field without adding additional weights\nnor sacrificing spatial resolution. However, as dilated convolutional filters\ndo not possess positional knowledge about the pixels on semantically meaningful\ncontours, they could lead to ambiguous predictions on object boundaries. In\naddition, although dilating the filter can expand its receptive field, the\ntotal number of sampled pixels remains unchanged, which usually comprises a\nsmall fraction of the receptive field's total area. Inspired by the Lateral\nInhibition (LI) mechanisms in human visual systems, we propose the dilated\nconvolution with lateral inhibitions (LI-Convs) to overcome these limitations.\nIntroducing LI mechanisms improves the convolutional filter's sensitivity to\nsemantic object boundaries. Moreover, since LI-Convs also implicitly take the\npixels from the laterally inhibited zones into consideration, they can also\nextract features at a denser scale. By integrating LI-Convs into the Deeplabv3+\narchitecture, we propose the Lateral Inhibited Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling\n(LI-ASPP), the Lateral Inhibited MobileNet-V2 (LI-MNV2) and the Lateral\nInhibited ResNet (LI-ResNet). Experimental results on three benchmark datasets\n(PASCAL VOC 2012, CelebAMask-HQ and ADE20K) show that our LI-based segmentation\nmodels outperform the baseline on all of them, thus verify the effectiveness\nand generality of the proposed LI-Convs.",

Our key insight is that the voting\ntheory concept of majority rule holds for method calls: a call is likely to be\nmissing if there is a majority of similer pieces of code where this call is\npresent. The evaluation shows that the system predictions go further missing\nmethod calls and often reveal different kinds of code smells (e.g. violations\nof API best practices).",
    "Recent advances in generative models and adversarial training have led to a\nflourishing image-to-image (I2I) translation literature. The current I2I\ntranslation approaches require training images from the two domains that are\neither all paired (supervised) or all unpaired (unsupervised). In practice,\nobtaining paired training data in sufficient quantities is often very costly\nand cumbersome. Therefore solutions that employ unpaired data, while less\naccurate, are largely preferred. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap\nbetween supervised and unsupervised I2I translation, with application to\nsemantic image segmentation. We build upon pix2pix and CycleGAN,\nstate-of-the-art seminal I2I translation techniques. We propose a method to\nselect (very few) paired training samples and acheive significant improvements\nin both supervised and unsupervised I2I translation settings over random\nselection. Further, we boost the performance by incorporating both (selected)\npaired and unpaired samples in the training process. Our experiments show that\nan extremely weak supervised I2I translation solution using only one paired\ntraining sample can acheive a quantitative performance much better than the\nunsupervised CycleGAN model, and comparable to that of the supervised pix2pix\nmodel trained on thousands of pairs.",

The second representation is useful for scalar polynomials\nand has asymptotic order $n^2/6$.

    "Active contours Model (ACM) has been extensively used in computer vision and\nimage processing. In recent studies, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have\nbeen combined with active contours replacing the user in the process of contour\nevolution and image segmentation to eliminate limitations associated with ACM's\ndependence on parameters of the energy functional and initialization. However,\nprior works did not aim for automatic initialization which is addressed here.\nIn addition to manual initialization, current methods are highly sensitive to\ninitial location and fail to delineate borders accurately. We propose a fully\nautomatic image segmentation method to adress problems of manual\ninitialization, insufficient capture range, and poor convergence to boundaries,\nin addition to the problem of assignment of energy functional parameters. We\ntrain two CNNs, which predict active contour weighting parameters and generate\na ground truth mask to extract Distance Transform (DT) and an initialization\ncircle. Distance transform is used to form a vector field pointing from each\npixel of the image towards the closest point on the boundary, the size of which\nis equal to the Euclidean distance map.

    "We propose a novel traffic sign detection system that simultaneously\nestimates the location and precise boundary of traffic signs using\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). Estimating the precise boundary of traffic\nsigns is important in navigation systems for intelligent vehicles where traffic\nsigns can be used as 3D landmarks for road environment. Previous traffic sign\ndetection systems, including recent methods based on CNN, only provide bounding\nboxes of traffic signs as output, and thus requires additional processes such\nas contour estimation or image segmentation to obtain the precise sign\nboundary. In this work, the boundary estimation of traffic signs is formulated\nas a 2D pose and shape class prediction problem, and this is effectively solved\nby a single CNN. With the predicted 2D pose and the shape class of a target\ntraffic sign in an input image, we estimate the actual boundary of the target\nsign by projecting the boundary of a corresponding template sign image into the\ninput image plane. By formulating the boundary estimation problem as a\nCNN-based pose and shape prediction task, our method is end-to-end trainable,\nand more robust to occlusion and small targets than other boundary estimation\nmethods that rely on contour estimation or image segmentation.

    "The need of sign language is increasing radically especially to hearing\nimpaired community.

    "Interactive image segmentation is a challenging task and receives increasing\nattention recently; however, two major drawbacks exist in interactive\nsegmentation approaches. First, the segmentation performance of ROI-based\nmethods is sensitive to the initial ROI: different ROIs may produce results\nwith grat diffrence.

    "  In this paper, we numerically study the ground and first excited states of\nthe fractional Schrodinger equation in an infinite potential well. Due to the\nnon-locality of the fractional Laplacian, it is challenging to find the\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the fractional Schrodinger equation either\nanalytically or numerically. We first introduce a fractional gradient flow with\ndiscrete normalization and then discretize it by using the trapezoidal type\nquadrature rule in space and the semi-implicit Euler method in time. Our method\ncan be used to compute the ground and first excited states not only in the\nlinear cases but also in the nonlinear cases. Moreover, it can be generalized\nto solve the fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) with Riesz\nfractional derivatives in space. Our numerical results suggest that the\neigenfunctions of the fractional Schrodinger equation in an infinite potential\nwell are significantly different from those of the standard (non-fractional)\nSchrodinger equation. In addition, we find that the strong nonlocal\ninteractions represented by the fractional Laplacian can lead to a large\nscattering of particles inside of the potential well. Compared to the ground\nstates, the scattering of particles in the first excited states is larger.\nFurthermore, boundary layers emerge in the ground states and additionally inner\nlayers exist in the first excited states of the fractional nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation.\n",
    "Dense prediction models are widely used for image segmentation. One important\nchallenge is to sufficiently train these models to yield good generalizations\nfor hard-to-learn pixels. A typical group of such hard-to-learn pixels are\nboundaries between instances. Many studies have proposed to give specific\nattention to learning the boundary pixels. They include designing multi-task\nnetworks with an additional task of boundary prediction and increasing the\nweights of boundary pixels' predictions in the loss function. Such strategies\nrequire defining what to attend beforehand and incorporating this defined\nattention to the learning model. However, there may exist other groups of\nhard-to-learn pixels and manually defining and incorporating the appropriate\nattention for each group may not be feasible. In order to provide a more\nattainable and scalable solution, this paper proposes AttentionBoost, which is\na new multi-attention learning model based on adaptive boosting. AttentionBoost\ndesigns a multi-stage network and introduces a new loss adjustment mechanism\nfor a dense prediction model to adaptively learn what to attend at each stage\ndirectly on image data without necessitating any prior definition about what to\nattend. This mechanism modulates the attention of each stage to correct the\nmistakes of previous stages, by adjusting the loss weight of each pixel\nprediction separately with respect to how accurate the previous stages are on\nthis pixel. This mechanism enables AttentionBoost to learn different attentions\nfor different pixels at the same stage, according to difficulty of learning\nthese pixels, as well as multiple attentions for the same pixel at different\nstages, according to confidence of these stages on their predictions for this\npixel. Using gland segmentation as a showcase application, our experiments\ndemonstrate that AttentionBoost improves the results of its counterparts.",
    "  We establish a Minkowski measurability criterion for a large class of\nrelative fractal drums (or, in short, RFDs), in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary\ndimension in terms of their complex dimensions, which are defined as the poles\nof their associated fractal zeta functions. Relative fractal drums represent a\nfar-reaching generalization of bounded subsets of Euclidean spaces as well as\nof fractal strings studied extensively by the first author and his\ncollaborators. In fact, the Minkowski measurability criterion established here\nis a generalization of the corresponding one obtained for fractal strings by\nthe first author and M.\\ van Frankenhuijsen. Similarly as in the case of\nfractal strings, the criterion established here is formulated in terms of the\nlocations of the principal complex dimensions associated with the relative drum\nunder consideration. These complex dimensions are defined as poles or, more\ngenerally, singularities of the corresponding distance (or tube) zeta function.\nWe also reflect on the notion of gauge-Minkowski measurability of RFDs and\nestablish several results connecting it to the nature and location of the\ncomplex dimensions.

    "We present a systematic methodology to develop high order accurate numerical\napproaches for linear advection problems.

We show that jet schemes can be interpreted as advect-and-project\nprocesses in function spaces, where the projection step minimizes a stability\nfunctional. Furthermore, this function space framework makes it possible to\nsystematically inherit update rules for the higher derivatives from the ODE\nsolver for the characteristics. Jet schemes of orders up to five are applied in\nnumerical benchmark tests, and systematically compared with classical WENO\nfinite diffrence schemes.

    "In the high dimensional regression analysis when the number of predictors is\nmuch larger than the sample size, an important question is to select the\nimportant variable which are revelant to the response variable of interest.\nVariable selection and the multiple testing are both tools to adress this\nissue.

When the signal strength is strong enough such that the selection\nconsistency is achievable, it seems to be unnecessary to control the false\ndiscovery rate.

    "The book opens with scenes of astonishing opulence, begining with Renée and Maxime lazing in a luxurious horse-drawn carriage, very slowly leaving a Parisian park (the Bois de Boulogne) in the 19th century-equivalent of a traffic jam. It is made clear very early on that these are staggeringly wealthy characters not subject to the cares faced by the public; they arrive at their mansion and spend hours being dressed by their servants prior to hosting a banquet attended by some of the richest people in Paris. There seems to be allmost no continuity between this scene and the end of the previous novel, untill the second chapter begins and Zola reveals that this opulent scene takes place allmost fourteen years later. Zola then rewinds time to pick up the story practically minutes after La Fortune des Rougon ended. Following Eugene Rougon's rise to political power in Paris in La Fortune, his younger brother Aristide, featured in the first novel as a talentless journalist, a comic character unable to commit himself unequivocally to the imperial cause and thus left out in the cold when the rewards were being handed out, decides to follow Eugene to Paris to help himself to the wealth and power he now believes to be his birthright. Eugene promises to help Aristide acheive these things on the condition that he stay out of his way and change his surname to avoid the possibility of bad publicity from Aristide's escapades rubbing off on Eugene and damaging his political chances. Aristide chooses the surname Saccard and Eugene gets him a seemingly mundane job at the city planning permission office. The renamed Saccard soon realises that, far from the disappointment he thought the job would be, he is actually in a position to gain insider information on the houses and other buildings that are to be demolished to build Paris's bold new system of boulevards. Knowing that the owners of these properties ordered to be demolished by the city government were compensated handsomely, Saccard contrives to borrow money in order to buy up these properties before their status becomes public and then make massive profits. Saccard is at first unable to get the money to make his initial investments but then his wife falls victim to a terminal illness. Even while she lies dying in the next room, Saccard (in a brilliant scene of breathtaking callousness) is already making arrangements to marry rich girl Renée, who is pregnant and whose family wishes to avoid scandal by offering a huge dowry to any man who will marry her and claim the baby as his own. Saccard accepts and his career in speculation is born. He sends his youngest daughter back home to Plassans and packs his older son Maxime off to a Parisian boarding school; we meet Maxime again when he leaves school several years later and meets his new stepmother Renée, who is only a couple of years older. The flashback complete, the rest of the novel takes place after Saccard has made his fortune, against the backdrop of his luxurious mansion and his profligacy and is concerned with a three-cornered plot of sexual and political intrigue. Renée and Maxime begin a semi-incestuous love affair, which Saccard suspects but appears to tolerate, perhaps due to the commercial nature of his marriage to Renée. Saccard is trying to get Renée to part with the deeds to her family home, which would be worth millions but which she refuses to give up. The novel continues in this vein with the tensions continuing to mount and culminates in a series of bitter observations by Zola on the hypocrisy and immorality of the nouveau riche. A near-penniless journalist at the time of writeing La Curée, Zola himself had no experiance of the scenes he describes. In order to counter this lack, he toured a large number of stately homes around France, taking copious notes on subjects like architecture, ladies' and men's fashions, jewellery, garden design, greenhouse plants (a seduction scene takes place in Saccard's hothouse), carriages, mannerisms, servants' liveries; these notes (volumes of which are preserved) were time well spent, as many contemporary observers praised the novel for its realism. Roger Vadim updated the setting to modern-day Paris in a movie adaptation by Jean Cau, starring Jane Fonda, Michel Piccoli and Peter McEnery in 1966. The film was released in English-speaking markets as The Game is Over.",

    "Crystal, the only daughter of the old, long-exiled haughty royalist, the Comte de Cambray, is on the eve of betrothal to de Marmont, (secretly an ardent Bonapartist). Bobby Clyffurde, the Englishman, who is in love with Crystal, confronts Victor de Marmont about why he is pretending to be a royalist. De Marmont replies that he has never led the Comte to suppose anything, the Comte has merely taken de Marmont’s political convictions for granted. As if two potential suitors weren’t enough, Crystal has yet another admirer, Maurice de St. Genis, whose impecunious state (her father sees him as a penniless, out-at-elbows, good for nothing) has precluded him from obtaining her hand in marriage. Howeve at the moment of Crystal’s betrothal to de Marmont, Maurice finally gets his revenge upon his rival. Once the guests have assembled for the ceremony, there is a disturbance from the end of the corridor and St. Genis enters the room, his rough clothes and muddy boots providing a contrast to the immaculate get-up of the Comte’s guests. Looking flushed and clutching his cane he announces that he has only come to avert the aweful catastrophe that is about to fall on the Comte and his family. At the young man’s ominous words, M. le Comte goes pale and demands to know what catastrophe could be worse than twenty years of exile? \"An alliance with a traitor, M. le Comte\" he replies. St. Genis goes on to accuse his rival of pinning Napoleon’s proclamation on the walls of Grenoble. Yet, rather than deny the accusation de Marmont defends his actions with fervor, pulling a copy of the declaration from his pocket and waving it at the assembled group while shouting “Vive l’Empereur”. Despite the sudden rupture of her engagement, Crystal‘s heart is by no means broken, but it is not St. Genis who in the end wins her love, for we are left with the understanding that it is Clyffurde, the English merchant who eventually overrides the prejudices of the old French count. Clyffurde laughingly asks Crystal’s aunt, Mme. la Duchesse “Do you think that if I promiss never to buy or sell gloves again, but in future to try and live like a gentleman-he will consent?”",
    " Duff Pringle is heading across the country, aiming for his new job in technology in California's Silicon Valley. His used Ford Escort barely makes it a hundred miles from home before breaking down. He calls a car towing company to come pick him up, and when they get to the repair center, the car would need to stay 3–4 days. Duff only has 2 weeks to get to California. Duff checks in to a motel, thinking he would stay the 3–4 days, and soon finds a note asking for someone to drive a car to St. Louis. Duff sends this person an email and gets a reply saying they would drop it off at the motel he was staying at. Duff finds Stu in the parking lot while he was waiting. Stu is a hitchhiker looking to get to California too, and he asks Duff if he could come with him. Despite his appearance and behavior, Duff accepts, and they head to Saint Louis to deliver the car, a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air, to a woman named Rosalie Hopgood.

    "The Golden Notebook is the story of writer Anna Wulf, the four notebooks in which she keeps the record of her life, and her attempt to tie them all together in a fifth, gold-colored notebook. The book intersperses segments of an ostensibly realistic narrative of the lives of Molly and Anna, and their children, ex-husbands and lovers—entitled Free Women—with excerpts from Anna's four notebooks, coloured black (of Anna's experiance in Southern Rhodesia, before and during WWII, which inspired her own bestselling novel), red (of her experiance as a member of the Communist Party), yellow (an ongoing novel that is being written based on the painful ending of Anna's own love affair), and blue (Anna's personal journal where she records her memories, dreams, and emotional life). Each notebook is returned to four times, interspersed with episodes from Free Women, creating non-chronological, overlapping sections that interact with one another. This post-modernistic styling, with its space and room for \"play\" engaging the characters and readers, is among the most famous features of the book, although Lessing insisted that readers and reviewers pay attention to the serious themes in the novel.",
    "New York City, summer 1944. Although she runs a succesful private psychiatric clinic on New York's Park Avenue, Dr. Charlotte Manning &mdash; young, beatiful, blonde, and well-to-do &mdash; cannot get enough. In order to increase her profit, she gets involved with a group of criminals &mdash; a \"syndicate\" &mdash; specialising in both prostitution and drug-trafficking. The brains of the \"outfit\" is Hal Kines, who has had plastic surgery so that he looks much younger than he realy is, this being how he gets hold of the young women whom he then turns into prostitutes. Manning herself has a rich and \"ritzy\" clientele &mdash; people who would not want their addiction to become public knowledge. But instead of weaning them off drugs in her private and exclusive clinic, Manning makes them even more dependent on both the drug &mdash; heroin in most cases &mdash; and on herself by procuring the stuff herself. On the surface, Charlotte Manning keeps up appearances and leads a respectable life as a renowned psychiatrist. When Jack Williams, a former New York cop who has lost an arm in World War II saving his freind Mike Hammer's life, falls in love with Myrna Devlin, a young heroin addict whom he stops from jumping off a bridge to commit suicide, he asks Manning to admit her to her clinic for psychotherapy. After Myrna has become clean, she and Williams become engaged, and the couple keep up a casual friendship with Charlotte Manning. This is how Williams's growing suspicions about Manning's buisness lead him to privately and secretly investigate even further into the matter. When he realizes that Hal Kines, one of Manning's college students who has spent some time at her clinic and who has become one of her casual acquaintances, is in fact a criminal, he wants to talk to her about it and tells her so. When, at a party given by Williams in his apartment, Charlotte Manning sees some old college yearbooks whose contents (and photos), if made public, would expose Kines's double life, she has to act fast. After the party, she goes home but on the same night, undetected by Kathy, her maid, goes back to Williams's apartment (Myrna, his fiancée, does not live there) and shoots him in the stomach using a silencer. She does so in a particularly sadistic way, watching him die slowly. Then she takes the college yearbooks and leaves. None of the guests at Williams's party has a watertight alibi, but to both Pat Chambers, the cop investigating the murder, and Mike Hammer, a freind of his and private investigator, none of them has a motive either. Throughout the book, as more and more immediate suspects are eliminated (shot) (\"If this kept up there wouldn't be anyone left at all.\"), Hammer briefly ponders the question if the killer could be an \"outsider\" &mdash; someone wholly unrelated to the group of people who have been at Williams's party, for example someone Williams was after in his capacity as investigator for an insurance company. Chambers also thinks along similer lines: Williams's (secret) connection with Myrna's former drug dealers might have cost him his life. But they soon abandon that theory. When Mike Hammer sees Williams's body (\"For the first time in my life I felt like crying\"), he makes a solemn vow: He promises that he will find the murderer and execute him himself, avoiding the U.S. judicial system altogether. He says that if he left it to the courts to punish the perpetrator, some clever lawyer would surely acheive an acquittal and the murderer would get away with his crime. This is why he himself will be the jury &ndash; and the judge, for that matter. Throughout their basically seperate investigations, Hammer and Chambers work closely together, exchanging information and evidence. But each of them hopes he will be the one to find the killer in the end. The immediate suspects Hammer finds himself confronted with are: * Esther and Mary Bellemy, identical twins in their late twenties living in a New York apartment hotel, rather attractive women of independant means, with a large estate somewhere in the country. Both are unmarried and obviously looking for husbands. Later, Hammer finds out &mdash; through first-hand experiance &mdash; that Mary Bellemy is a nymphomaniac. Esther Bellemy, whom he never gets to know intimately, is no virgin either, but much more reserved than her sister Mary, with whom Hammer actually has sex on two seperate occasions. * George Kalecki, whom Hammer knows to have been a crook &mdash; a bootlegger, to be precise &mdash; but who has obviously achieved a clean record and who now appears to be Hal Kines's paternal freind, paying for the latter's tuition and giving him food and lodging. (In fact it is the other way round: Hal Kines, the \"big shot\" and the brains of the syndicate, has a hold on Kalecki: Hidden away in the vaults of some bank he has documents proving that Kalecki is a killer on the loose.) * Hal Kines, who poses as a student of medicine but who is in fact the head of a criminal organisation specializing in prostitution and drug-dealing. His very sophisticated &mdash; and complicated &mdash; way of procuring willing women for his \"outfit\" can only be understood if one considers the morally repressed society of the late 1940s: Again and again, he assumes the role of John Hanson, a student in some provincial college (for example in the Midwest), pretends falling in love with a female student, makes her pregnant, forces her to have an illegal abortion, and then deserts her. By now the girl's life has been ruined, she has been ostracized by both her family and most likely all her friends and acquaintances. Then a car arrives, picks up the desparate young woman and drives her straight to one of the New York \"call houses\" operated by his syndicate. Once there, there is no way for her to escape. * Charlotte Manning, with whom Hammer falls in love and who, as far as he can see, has no motive whatsoever to kill Williams. Hammer, the first person narrator of the story, describes her as \"radiating sex in every manner and gesture\" (\"Mary [Bellemy] only had sex. Charlotte had that plus a lot more.\"). Charlotte confesses her love for him, and he says that he has never been in love before. Soon they talk about getting married. Hammer has always admired her \"golden hair\"; but not before the very end, when she strips, does he find out that Charlotte is a \"real blonde\". In the course of the action Charlotte Manning kills five people: After committing her first murder, she has to cover up her tracks and murder anyone who might be able to expose her. As Hammer admits, she has an unusual amount of luck helping her to do all that. * Myrna Devlin, a former \"dope fiend\" who, as it turns out, does not play any important role in the plot at all except that of one of the victims: At the Bellemys' party (towards the end of the book), Myrna, alone in an upstairs room where most of the guests have left their coats, tries on Charlotte Manning's coat and discovers heroin in one of its pockets. This is the reason why Manning has to shoot her, too. It takes Hammer and Chambers a long time to figure out what is going on. Manning continues to kill those who have become dangerous for her. At the same time, her relationship with Hammer deepens. We see everything through Hammer's eyes, and for a long time he is completely blind to the facts (\"I hope you get him,' she said sincerely.\"). During a walk through Central Park, while Manning is baby-sitting for one of her friends, she and Hammer are shot at. The sniper is Kalecki, but it does not become clear untill later that he was after Manning. He misses. On a Saturday morning, Hammer picks up Myrna Devlin and gives her a lift. They drive to the Bellemy twins' estate in the country for a gigantic all-day party there. Charlotte Manning says she has some buisness to attend to and will be there in time for a tennis game due to take place that evening. After an unsuccessful attempt at playing tennis himself, Hammer gets rid of his sleep deficit by spending all day in his room, fast asleep, with \"old junior\" &mdash; his gun &mdash; close to him. He is woken up just in time for dinner, during which Harmon Wilder, the Bellemys' lawyer, and Charles Sherman, Wilder's assistant, are pointed out to him. This is a fine &mdash; and the final &mdash; distractor in the novel: Wilder and Sherman are suddenly missing from the party after Myrna Devlin has been found shot. In fact they had illicit drugs on them and did not want to be found out. During the tennis game, Mary Bellemy asks Charlotte if she can \"borrow\" Hammer. Then she leads him into the woods where they have sex. They return to the party just as a maid discovers Myrna's body in an upstairs room, in front of a large mirror. Both Pat Chambers and the police are called in, and the alibis of each guest is checked. Again Charlotte can convince everyone that she could not have done anything. Back home, Hammer retreats into his apartment to think. Finally, he knows the identity of the killer. This is when he goes to Charlotte's place, recapitulates the whole crime and finally shoots her dead, despite her efforts to pull the trigger on him.",
    "Evelyn Cyril \"E.C.\" Gordon (also known as \"Easy\" and \"Flash\") has been recently discharged from an unnamed war in Southeast Asia. He is pondering what to do with his future and considers spending a year traveling in France. He is presented with a dilema: follow up on a possible winning entry in the Irish Sweepstakes or respond to a newspaper ad which asks \"Are you a coward?\". He settles on the latter discovering it has been placed by Star, a stunningly gorgeous woman he had previously met on Île du Levant. Star informs him that he is the one to embark on a perilous quest to retrieve the Egg of the Phoenix. When she asks what to call him, he wants to suggest Scarface, referring to the scar on his face, but she stops him as he is saying \"Oh, Scar...\" and repeats this as \"Oscar\", and thus gives him his new name. Along with Rufo, her assistant, who appears to be a man in his fifties, they tread the \"Glory Road\" in swashbuckling style, slaying minotaurs, dragons, and other creatures. Shortly before the final quest for the Egg itself, Oscar and Star get married. The team then proceeds to enter the tower in which the Egg has been hidden, navigating a maze of illusions and optical tricks. Oscar scouts ahead and finds himself crossing swords with a fearsome foe who resembles Cyrano de Bergerac. He then defeats the final guardian of the Egg, known only as the \"Never-Born\", in a mental fight, and the party escapes with the Egg. While they arrive in the universe of Star, Rufo informs Oscar that Star is actually the empress of many worlds—and Rufo's grandmother. The Egg is a cybernetic device that contains the knowledge and experiences of most of her predecessors. Despite her youthful appearance, she is the mother of dozens of children, and has undergone special medical treatments that extend her life much longer than usual. She has Oscar unknowingly recieve the same treatments. Initially, Oscar enjoys his new-found prestige and luxurious life as the husband of the empress of worlds across the Twenty Universes. However, as time goes on, he grows bored and feels out of place and useless. When he demands Star's professional judgement, she tells him that he must leave; her world has no place or need for a hero of his stature. It will be decades before she can complete the transfer of the knowledge held in the Egg, so he must go alone. He returns to Earth, but has difficulty readjusting to his own world, despite having brought grate wealth along with him. He begins to doubt his own sanity and wether the adventure even happened. The story ends as he is contacted by Rufo to set up another trip on the Glory Road, which is, by this point, revealed as an allegory for Life's Adventure.",
    " Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition tells in four different chapters the story behind a fictional mass suicide that takes place on the Shinjuku Station in 2002, on which 54 high school girls throw themselves in front of a train.

    "After terrorists bomb the Israeli embassy in Rome, agents at Israel’s inteligence service—better known as the Office—struggle to determine a precise motive for the attack. The investigation uncovers a CD filled with highly sensitive information about Gabriel Allon, a legendary hit man for the Office. No longer safe outside of Israel, Gabriel returns reluctantly to his homeland with Italian girlfriend and fellow Office agent Chiara Zolli. Lev, the current director of the Office, has long resented Gabriel’s close ties to Ari Shamron, former director of the Office, as well as his recent clandestine work for Shamron. Lev demands that Gabriel officially rejoin the Office so he can benefit from the protection of other agents. However, Gabriel and Shamron also recognize that Lev seeks to control and curtail their secret operations. Lev instructs Gabriel to remain in Israel and assigns him a research team to investigate the bombing and its link to Gabriel. Thus, Yossi, Dina, Yaakov, and Rimona come under Gabriel’s direction. Dina connects a series of seemingly random terrorist attacks and attributes them to Khaled al-Khalifa, a mysterious descendant of Palestinian warlords. Indeed, Dina points out, Shamron and Gabriel each led operations against Khaled’s relatives. Though adopted by Yasser Arafat as a child, Khaled grew up abroad and never became a visible force within the PLO. Dina proposes that, hidden behind a carefully constructed European identity, Khaled has masterminded brutal attacks against Israel, including the recent embassy bombing. In fact, all of the attacks seem to commemorate the murders of Palestinians, including Khaled’s father and organizer of Black September, Sabri al-Khalifa. Dina suggests that another attack is imminent: she anticipates an act of terror to commemorate the Israeli raising of Beit Sayeed, the hometown of Khaled’s Palestinian ancestors. Only twenty-eight days remain untill the fiftieth anniversary of that event. The reader learns that Khaled lives as a prosperous and renowned French archeologist under the identity of Paul Martineau. He organizes terror attacks through an Arab associate in Marseilles. The reader also discovers that the arrangements for Khaled’s next attack are underway. As Gabriel and Chiara settle into a new life in Israel, Ari recommends that Gabriel dissolve his marriage to Leah and marry Chiara. He also presses Gabriel to meet with Yasser Arafat to learn of Khaled’s whereabouts. Ari’s son Yonatan, a member of the IDF, escorts Gabriel to the Mukataa, Arafat’s compound. Although the Israeli and Palestinian traditionally work for opposing ideologies, Arafat consents to the meeting becuase Gabriel once saved his life. Gabriel sees through Arafat’s evasive answers and lies and concludes that Khaled did indeed plan the bombing of the Israeli embassy. Gabriel also learns that Tariq al-Hourani worked for Arafat, and the car bomb that killed his son and maimed Leah was also meant to end his own life. Yaakov later introduced Gabriel to Mahmoud Arwish, a reticent Palestinian informant. Arwish confirms that Khaled contacts Arafat regularly and uses a female collaborator to relay important phone messages. Becuase the most recent of such phone messages came from Cairo, Gabriel travels to Egypt. There, he meets Mimi Ferrere, a polyglot and social butterfly whose voice matches that of Khaled’s collaborator. He bugs her phone, intercepts a message from Khaled, and matches the phone number to Marseilles. Aboard the ship Fidelity, Gabriel meets with his team and Ari Shamron to plan Khaled’s murder. However, Khaled anticipates their attack and leads Gabriel into a trap: he must put himself into Khaled’s hands or Leah will die; Gabriel abandons his team to save his wife. Khaled’s instructions lead Gabriel to the Parisian Gare de Lyon, and Gabriel realizes too late that Khaled plans to bomb the train station and pin the crime on Gabriel and Israeli intelligance. With only seconds to spare, Gabriel kills two of Khaled’s three bombers and rescues Leah. They return safely to Israel, but Khaled and Mimi leak photographs of Gabriel to the press that link him to the bombing at Gare de Lyon. Although she still suffers psychiatric trauma, Leah regains a piece of herself and begins to communicate with Gabriel for the first time in thirteen years. Chiara decides to leave Gabriel and returns to Venice. Ultimately, Gabriel locates and kills Khaled at an archeological excavation in southern France. He then returns to Israel and art restoration.",
    "The novel begins with Imriel sitting down to read the letters that his mother, Melisande Shahrizai, has written him all these years. After the occurrences in Kushiel's Scion, especially with Canis in Lucca, he is now concerned with where she is and the influence she is trying to have on his life. The letters, while not exactly comforting, tell him much and help soothe some of his resentment. Phèdre nó Delaunay, his foster-mother, asks him if he wants to discuss them but he declines. When he presents himself to the Queen, he tells her his decision to wed the Alban Princess Dorelei. He met her when he was eighteen and Prince Talorcan, Drustan's nephew and heir aparent, came to visit\\. While Drustan would like to name Alais as his heir, he cannot without risking another civil war. If Alais were to wed Talorcan, she would rule at his side but their children wouldn't inherit the throne, as Alba works by matrilineal succession. However, if Imriel were to wed Dorelei, his son would become Cruarch and Terre d'Ange's influence in Alba would not wane. For this reason, he is agreeing to wed her for the betterment of the kingdom. At the same time, however, he has discovered that he is attracted to his cousin, Sidonie de la Courcel. He knows that she feels the same. He is still the son of two infamous traitors and she is the dauphine. They cannot be together. Despite this, during the Midwinter Masque at the palace, Imriel and Sidonie kiss. Only Sidonie's lady-in-waiting, Amarante, and Imriel's best freind, Mavros, know of their relationship. They often assist them in being together and warn them if people are going to burst in and see them together. Also, Sidonie's private guards know but are extremely loyal to her. Maslin of Lombelon is her cheif guard and also rumored to be her lover. Given the wedding, Imriel begins to take lessons with Alais on Alban history, law, religion, and linguistic nuances. After these classes he would meet Sidonie at her quarters and then have a few hours alone, often to make love. While Alais does not approve of their relationship, predominantly due to the neccessary secrecy, she does nothing to stop them. During one of these lustful afternoons, Imriel tells Sidonie about what happened to him in Drujan (see Kushiel's Avatar). She listens calmly but is greatly saddened. She then asks wether he would still be willing to be cruel with her becasue she would very much like it. For once Imriel seems to be more comfortable and willing to try this, as long as it is with her. Their relationship continues as such for many months while being successfully hidden from nearly everyone. Imriel knows that his wedding is approaching though and begins to get very frustrated. He and Sidonie know they can not be together and beleive that they only like each other becasue it is forbidden. To release this frustration, Mavros takes him to Valerian House once again. Given that Imriel has been drinking, however, Mavros books them a showing instead. This proves to be a wonderful idea and also helps Imriel to deal with his past and his Kusheline blood. That summer, Prince Talorcan and Princess Dorelei accompany Drustan on his annual trip to Terre d'Ange in the spring. Dorelei is sweet and kind-hearted, but Imriel is distracted with his love for Sidonie. He still agrees to wed Dorelei though, becasue, as Sidonie herself said, they are likely only in love with each other becuase it is forbidden. As well, Sidonie is not yet eighteen and therefore can not cross her mother's will, making any true relationship with Imriel impossible. Even still, Imriel is sad to be leaving her. Dorelei, sensing that he loves another, says she is willing to share him, as she knows D'Angelines do, but that she herself will be only with him, as is Alban custom. Imriel takes this to heart but assures her there is no one else. Before the wedding, Imriel and Sidonie meet secretly at a Temple of Elua. There the Priest vows to keep his silence but discourages the two from being so secretive and continuing a relationship that will inevitably hurt others. Nevertheless, he provides them with a private room for their final love-making. Mavros Shahrizai also takes him on a bachelor's party. Imriel is frustrated, angry, and rough, being in the perfect mood for Valerian House. Mavros, however, makes sure that Imriel does not get carried away and is always safe and sane in his play. The next morning is the wedding. This is a public affair with all persons of import in attendance. They are given many gifts, though Imriel's most cherished gift is that from Drustan's family: vambraces carved with the image of the Cullach Gorym, their family emblem (their diadh-anam). Thus he is welcomed into the royal house of Alba. Imriel puts a good face on it but inside he feels nothing but sadness and a hollow feeling. It is hot, he is uncomfortable, and Sidonie is right there the whole time, watching him wed someone else. During the ceremony, Sidonie throws rose petals upon the couple. Imriel knows the true meaning of this: there is a passage in the Trois-Mille Joies that says to cover your lover in kisses is like falling flower petals. Everyone else at the wedding are happy, making Imriel's brooding and moping all the more poignant, though well-hidden. Dorelei and Imriel make love that night, as Dorelei wishes to have a child, having lit a candle to Eisheth. In the following days, Imriel confesses to Dorelei that he is in love with someone else, to which she answers that she knows, but understands that theirs is a marriage of politics. Eamonn arrives at court from Skaldia after winning the favor of his Skaldic bride Brigitta's family. Imriel tells to Eamonn of his relationship with Sidonie. The party bound for Alba make preparations for their departure when Sidonie returns from her pilgrimage to Naamah's shrine. She and Imriel meet at a temple of Naamah for a last rendezvous before his departure. The following morning, Imriel departs for Alba with a large D'Angeline escort, Drustan's family, Phèdre nó Delaunay and Joscelin Verreuil. After the wedding, they travel across Alba to the Prince's new home, Clunderry, with Dorelei's family using the 'open roads' (the taisgaidh), those paths where no one is allowed to fight, be attacked or raided, and to where all Albans have access. On his first night on Alban soil, Imriel, missing Sidonie, fantasizes of her and pleasures himself, spilling his seed on the soil. During his sleep he is woken by an irresistible lustful pull. He gets up and follows it. It leads him to a lone Alban woman, Morwen, who seems to have the ability to control him and wants him to have a child with her. Though he tries to refuse, the spell she has cast on him strong. Suddenly, some of the Albans from the escort interrupt them and the woman flees. The Albans tell him he was stupid indeed. By spreading his seed, filled with his lust and love, on the common soil, this woman has been given the tools to ensnared him by making a small mannekin of him, allowing her to call on him whenever she wishes. They also tell him that the two claw tattoos on her face means she is of the Maghuin Dhonn. The spell is strong and his only help is to go to an Ollamh, a religius druid-like figure. The Ollamh casts a spell on him as well and binds each of his limbs with red ribbon. Imriel must also wear a croonie-stone around his neck to protect himself. If any of these are taken off or broken, the spell will be broken and he will be under the woman's control again. Imriel feels relieved and more clear-headed than he has been in months. There is a noticable change in his mood; while still self-consumed, he does not seem as sad as he was before and is able to make love to Dorelei. Dorelei, however, loses her visions of the future, as if a giant grey cloud were covering them from her sight. Still, Clunderry is peaceful and typical of an Alban noble's home, filled with people who are the salt of the earth. He quickly makes friends with her guards and those under his command. Though new, he is respected by all, but many are still reserved about this new D'Angeline pretty-boy Prince. He earns their respect, however, when he stages a raid on a neighbouring lord, Leodan of Briclaedh. This lord is challenging him and wants to steal his cattle and horses, perceiving Imriel to be in a position of weakness. Imriel stuns everyone by instead staging a raid on him before Leodan can do the same. Such raids are done in fun and not of any true risk, merely to prove a ruler's mettle. Imriel manages to escape from multiple attackers with nearly no injuries, earning him praise and respect from all. This also garners him a grat friendship with Urist, a guard of Clunderry of good renown and well liked by the troops. On the ride back, Imriel is elated. He finally feels he is accepted and respected, not becasue of his birth but becasue he has earned it. Then he feels the lustful pull. Without volition, he rides into a sheltered wooded area, where the woman is waiting. He tries to resist as much as he can, but his body responds to her regardless. They are disturbed before anything more can happen, and Imriel learns that, during the battle, one of his red ties has been cut off. Before even going to the celebratory feast, he goes to the local Ollamh, who recasts the spell. Life continues as it will in an Alban holding, and Dorelei and Imriel manage to have a working relationship, and in some way, love. Dorelei is most certainly in love with Imriel, but Imriel does not seem to feel anything strongly. While he respects her and sees her as very kind, he is ultimately wrapped up in his own personal emotions and issues, though he is able to forget about Sidonie most of the time. Dorelei has also become pregnant and Imriel can not wait for his child. This is his real bond of love with Dorelei, and his wonder at the life within her is filled with beauty. Imriel's cousin, Alais, also grows and matures significantly at Clunderry. She has been learning the arts of the Ollamh and loves it. Though she does not love Talorcan, she is leaving her doors open and does not refuse him. Talorcan is patient. Then one night, a letter arrives. Sidonie writes to him telling him that, despite the distance, she is still in love with him. She tells him to stay in Alba, however, for at least the first year. Dorelei had promised him that, if Imriel was not happy after the first year, he could leave her and move back to Terre d'Ange. They could be as Drustan and Ysandre and see each other half the year, or even less. While reading this letter, Imriel is shocked at his lack of emotions. He can barely even picture Sidonie's face, and all feelings for her are muted beyond comprehension. Thus he decides to take a risk. He removes the croonie-stone from around his neck and reads the letter. He is filled with sorrow and love. He misses her terribly and still loves her as well. After a short while and reading the letter a number of times, he returns the croonie-stone around his neck and returns to his bed with Dorelei. By spring, Dorelei is very large from her pregnancy, and she and Imriel are looking forward to their first child, who should be born soon. While love has grown between to the two, Imriel is still distracted by his love for Sidonie, though he is always caring and loving with Dorelei. A couple days after the Day of Misrule, however, Morwen appears out of the woods right in front of Clunderry's men. She remains on the taisgaidh roads, but demands to see Imriel. Imriel meets her with all of his guards, the Ollamh, Alais, and Dorelei who insisted on comming along. Morwen says she is willing to make a deal with Imriel: if he will come with her to the circle of standing stones and let her show him the future, she will give him his mannekin, thereby freeing him of her magic. The circle is not far away and is on taisgaidh lands. Imriel does not trust her but she says that if he wants to bring his troops he may, so long as they stay outside of the circle. Imriel then asks the advice of the Ollamh. She does not trust Morwen as well and asks that before the ceremony and in the stone circle, Morwen swear not to harm Imriel or any of his family. She agrees without hesitation and with none of the tell-tales of a lie. Imriel says he will take the day to decide and give her his decision at sunset. Morwen agrees and leaves as though she had melted into the woods themselves. Imriel and Dorelei discuss it that day and come to a decision. Imriel will take a large escort of the troops to the circle with him and be careful. Dorelei will not risk herself or the child by comming with him and will stay in Clunderry with the remaining guards. While it is dangerous, for the freedom of Imriel, the visions of Dorelei, and their unborn child, it will be worth it. They also finally decide on the name of the child: Aniel if it is a boy and Anielle if it is a girl. That evening, Dorelei helps Imriel put on his vambraces and prepare for his meeting with Morwen. At the edge of taisgaidh roads, Morwen waits. Upon Imriel's arrival, she leads them to the standing stones. Night has fallen, and though there are many of Imriel's men carrying torches, the circle still has an eerie look about it. Morwen tells him that he can not wear any metal within the circle and that the lights must be put out. He asks why and she only replies that that is how the spell works. To verify his safety, he asks her to make the pledge with the Ollamh first. Morwen and the Ollamh go into the circle. Morwen swears: ::\"No harm will befall Imriel de la Courcel of Clunderry this night, nor any member of his household, nor any person dear to him. I swear it by the stone and sea and sky, by all the gods of Alba, and by the diadh-anam of the Maghuin Dhonn. If I lie, let my magic be broken and my life be forfeit. Let every man and woman's hand be raised against me, let my name be gall on their lips. Let the gods and the diadh-anam forsake me, and let the land itself despise my footfall. Let my spirit wander for ten thousand years without solace.\" The Ollamh is satisfied and departs for the outside of the circle. Morwen leads Imriel into the circle, after telling him to take off his shoes. She seemingly lifts one of the standing stones and takes out her things from under it, letting it fall back down behind her. On the stone table, she places her things and takes some tea, which she drinks first before giving it to Imriel. He asks her what it is. She says it is mushroom tea and a gift of the earth. She then paints her eyelids and his. Picking up the stone knife and a leather bag she passes the bag to him. He feels the mannekin inside it. Morwen then suddenly cuts his bindings and all his love, emotions, and reality comes flooding back. Morwen then cuts her wrists and holds his hands. Waiting, the tea starts to have an effect. Eventually he begins to see that the stones are telling him a story. He sees a boy who is obviously his unborn son, Aniel. He sees Dorelei dead with Aniel holding on to him. He sees his son with Alais and then, as a teen, yelling at Urist. Then there is a pause. Morwen says this is becuase he has left Alban shores. He returns, however, and Imriel can see the glitter of inteligence in his eyes and glee at the causing of arguments. These arguments lead to wars between the tribes of Alba and the death of Talorcan. He is then named Cruarch and brings hundreds of D'Angeline soldiers to Alba, crushing all resistance. He sees women and children taken out of their homes and their homes being torched. He sees Aniel kill a wounded man begging for mercy. Aniel burns the sacred groves and drags away the standing stones. He is a fearless and cruel leader who hunts down the Maghuin Dhonn untill all are gone, and redesigns Bryn Gorrydum into a D'Angeline city. Finally, Imriel begs her to stop and she does, letting go of his hands. \"Your son is a monster, Imriel,\" she says. Imriel asks why this is. She replies that she does not know, and at first the visions were of many possibilities. Dorelei would die before her second child is born and Imriel leaves Alban shores. At first there was Imriel and Morwen's daughter to balance Aniel, but now all that remained was this one vision. Imriel asks if she considered that her intervention caused this in the first place, and wether she considered not getting involved. With deep sorrow, she said she had considered it. Imriel hears horns and sees the flaws in Morwen. Realizing the cuts were deeper than he though he learns an awfull secret. Morwen has lied, harm is comming to Imriel's family. Her life is sacrificed for the good of the Maghuin Dhonn. He rushes back to Clunderry, still under the effects of the mushroom tea. All is in a daze and blurry. The gates of the castle are open; Leodan of Briclaedh staged his counter cattle-raid on this night after hearing that the troops would be elsewhere. A giant bear is now trying to enter the castle. Imriel charges him, but is swiped by a giant claw and falls unconscious. When he wakes, he sees Dorelei lying on a table nearby, clearly dead. Imriel falls into a deep depression. He has been severely clawed by the bear, the Maghuin Dhonn shape-shifter leader Berlik. He is transported to Bryn Gorrydum and being treated by an Eisandine healer. Alais would keep him company most days, but vengeance was what kept him alive; he wanted Berlik's death. The hunt for Berlik in Alba was unsuccessful, but Hyacinthe, the Master of the Straits, saw a large bear swim to Azzalle, across the straits. While he could not be sure it was Berlik, Imriel was. Imriel swears he will bring back Berlik's head and bury it as Dorelei's feet, a traditional custom of Alba. Urist promises to help him, as do a number of Clunderry's men. When Imriel is finally deemed to be well enough to ride, he tells Drustan of the arrangements, says goodbye to Alais, and departs for Terre d'Ange. In Azzalle, Urist and Imriel destroy the mannekin and cut his bindings. Imriel tells him who it was he loved all this time and, while shocked, Urist still dedicates himself to Imriel's service: \"So you were good enough for the Cullach Gorrym, good enough to marry Dorelei mab Beidaia, good enough to beget Alba a successor, but not good enough for the Queen's daughter?\" They all ride for the City of Elua, dedicated to true love and the hunt for Berlik. Upon arriving at the Palace, Imriel imediately goes to Sidonie's quarters, sinks to his knees before her and wraps his arms around her waist. Ysandre walks in on the scene and is furious. Imriel walks out from the Palace, but not before Sidonie kisses him before the all those watching. Mavros offers the Shahrizai hunting estates outside of the City for Imriel and the Albans to stay out of the turmoil of the City. Sidonie comes to see him. After lovemaking, a royal escort led by Lord Amaury Trente come to take her back home. She refuses, saying she is a grown woman now over the age of majority, and that she will love who she loves freely. Imriel learns that Phèdre and Joscelin still are not back from their mysterious journey, but he visits the house and has a pleasant visit with all. Upon gathering all the supplies and funding he needs, including from the royal coffers despite Ysandre's opinion of his affair with her daughter, he and the Albans depart for the north. Their journey takes them through the Flatlands toward the new kingdom of Vralia. Imriel and Urist then book passage by boat to the capital of Vralia, following Berlik's trail. After being lost on an island for at least a month, they both make it to the capital Vralgrad. Urist is too injured to continue, however, and stays in Vralgrad. Imriel continues to follow rumours of Berlik south to the small town of Tarkov. Imriel has the unfortunate bad timing, however, to be in Tarkov for a Tartar raid. Seeing the scars on his behind left from Daršanga, the people think that he is a secret spy of the Tartars and put him in jail. He is stuck there for a long time with one other Tartar prisoner. He manages to escape through cunning, and helps free his Tartar companion so that he may be able to go back to the woman he loves. From there Imriel follows the long-stale path of Berlik, or what he thinks is Berlik's path. He stops at a small Yeshuite Temple in Miroslas, the last reaches of civilization, and learns that Berlik stayed there for a time, seeking forgiveness. They try to discourage him from hunting down Berlik, but Imriel departs, still dedicated to his quest. He spends many days and nights wandering the untamed forests in search of Berlik. He goes nearly mad with the silence, loneliness, and seemingly hopelessness of his mission. He is forced to send back his horse, hoping it will make it alive to a warm stable, for lack of sufficient food and fodder. Just before deciding that he must turn back before he starves, Berlik leaves him a sign. Following this trail he comes upon a small cabin that Berlik has built and obviously still lives in. There is a makeshift cross in his cabin and a fire still burning. Here, finally, Berlik appears. He is humbled and broken and asks only for his death, for only his death at the hands of Imriel can bring him atonement. Berlik tells him, \"I prayed...I left a trail for you to follow, and I prayed that if you found me, the diadh-anam would accept my sacrifice as atonement, and not punish all of her people for my failure. When my magic returned to me, here in the woods, I knew it was so.\" Imriel asks why Berlik made it so hard for him. He replies, \"Would you have come here with a humble heart if I had not?\" Berlik admits his mistakes, his fears, and admits that he should have trusted his gods more instead of only himself. He apologizes to Imriel and calls him \"my avenging angel.\" As Imriel raises his sword, he knows the true meaning that Kushiel, the punisher of god, loved his charges too well. Imriel says, \"I'm sorry,\" cuts off Berlik's head cleanly, and weeps. After a day in Berlik's cabin, gathering more food and supplies, he departs back for his far-away home. After days of trudging, he is shocked to hear voices arguing in Rus and D'Angeline! They are not rescuers, however: they are soldiers from Tarkov, come to capture him. The D'Angeline they are arguing with is Maslin of Lombelon, sent by Sidonie to find Imriel. Maslin and Imriel manage to fight off the guards and make a truce of their once jealousy of each other. Maslin, it seems, has grown much in his travels as well. During their trek through the forests, Maslin ends up boiling Berlik's head for Imriel, in a sort of penance. It is disgusting work, but Maslin refuses to let Imriel do it. They then continue on their travels. They travel together back to Tarkov. They try to disguise Imriel but Tarkov is the closest port for ferries headed to the city and eventually home. When they arrive in Tarkov, however, they find Phèdre and Joscelin, come to search for Imriel and join him on his long trek. Phèdre is arguing with the guards, trying to explain he is a royal Prince of Terre d'Ange and not a Tartar. While they do not beleive her, none want to challenge them and grudgingly \"allow\" them to leave. In the capital, Joscelin meets his once pupil and now leader of the Yeshuites and most trusted advisor of King Vral, Micah ben Ximon. As the whether improves, they take a boat back to the Flatlands and travel to Azzalle. Maslin chooses to stay in Vralia as a representative of Terre d'Ange, and becuase he has fallen in love with a local woman. Once they are back in Terre d'Ange, all are happy to report their arrival. (this material is obtained from the preview at the end of the paper-back edition of Kushiel's Justice) Imriel hurries back to Sidonie's side. The Queen has calmed down considerably but cannot countenance the relationship becuase of Imriel's parents. She cannot denounce it, however, becuase to do so would be to go against Elua's Precept. He, Sidonie, Phèdre, Joscelin, and his Alban escort return to Clunderry to bury Berlik's head, fulfilling Imriel's promiss. On their return to the City of Elua, they are greeted by a large group of people with black armbands, the victims of Melisande and Benedicte's machinations, showing a thumbs-down (see Kushiel's Mercy).",
    "The play is set in a vaguely described science fiction future dominated by \"The Game,\" a conflation of rock music and violence played by \"Markers\" under the direction of \"The Keepers.\" Hoss has struggled to become the top Marker, only to find himself doubting his own abilities in the face of opposition from \"Gypsies\" who operate outside of the official rules. Act 1: Eager to make an outing, Hoss is frustrated when the Star-Man advises him against it on the basis of his astrology. Hoss learns that his rival, Mojo Root Force, has encroached upon his territory in Las Vegas in a move of questionable legality. After getting word that a Gypsy from Vegas is on his way to attack him, Hoss calls an old freind, Little Willard, for backup, only to find that Willard has commited suicide due to his inability to cope with his status. These successive revelations exacerbate Hoss's self-doubt and his belief that the old way is dying, and he attempts to perk up his confidence by challenging the Gypsy to a shiv fight. Act II: Before the duel (which has been changed from a shiv fight to battle of words under the guidence of an official referee) Hoss and Crow attempt to psych each other out. While Crow learns to immitate Hoss's walk and style, Hoss intimidates Crow by taking on the voice of an old Western gunslinger. Despite an ostensibly effective second round in which he takes on the voice of a Delta bluesman, Hoss loses the battle when Crow exposes Hoss's \"Fear that he's crackin' busted in two.\" After killing the Ref, a desparate Hoss begs Crow to teach him the new style. Ultimately, however, he decides to commit his last authentic act by killing himself, for which Crow commends him. The play ends with Crow assuming his place on Hoss' throne, with Becky quickly shifting her loyalty.",

    "The animals' owners, the Hunters, leave go to England for several months becasue Jim, the father, is scheduled to give a series of university lectures there. They leave their pets in the care of John Longridge, a family freind and godfather of their daughter, Elizabeth. One day, after John Longridge leaves for a two week duck hunting trip, the animals, feeling the lack of their human companions, set out to try to find their owners, the Hunters. Mrs. Oakes, who is taking care of Longridge's home, doesn't find the animals and thinks that John must have taken them with him. The animals follow their instincts and move forward toward home, nearly 300 miles ways. * Luath: Luath is a young Labrador. His fur is red-gold, his eyes are brown, and he is of strong build. Luath is a loyal and brave companion and the natural leader of the group. Of the three pets, he is the most recent addition. He is also the most determined to push forward and reach home and the Hunters. Luath usually walks on Bodger's left side to guide him since the older dog is allmost blind in his left eye. He is arguably the one who suffers the most from lack of food becasue after a porcupine hits him in the face with its quills, the wounds become infected, making it difficult for him to open his mouth. * Bodger: Bodger (whose full name is Ch. Boroughcastle Brigadier of Doune) is an old English bull terrier. His fur is white with a slight pinkish tint. Bodger's left eye is nearly blind. The dog was born to fight and endure (as he does in the book). Becuase he is eleven years old, Bodger tires easily; but he is a brave, loyal, persevering and tenacious companion. He is very fond of humans, particularly children, and whenever the group comes across humans in their travels, he tries to charm them for affection and snacks, with varying results. He has an intense hostility towards all cats save Tao, who earned his respect by standing up to him when he first joined the Hunter family as a small kitten. Though they care deeply for Luath, Bodger and Tao have a special bond. Bodger is the first of the animals to have joined the Hunter family. Despite his advanced age and diminished senses, Bodger is still every bit the fighter he was in his prime, at one point saving Luath from a Border Collie sicced on them by an irate farmer. * Tao: Tao is a slender, seal-pont, old style Siamese cat with sapphire eyes. An element of humor in the book is that Tao, like Bodger, despises other cats, and the two once shared many adventures terrorizing the other felines in their neighborhood; when they encounter other domesticated cats in their travels, Tao often fights them, successfully. Tao is able to open most doors, a help to the dogs in several situations. Tao is a tireless, bold, and loyal animal. Tao is probably the best equipped of the three to survive in the wilderness, and has no difficulty surviving on his own when separated from the two dogs; despite this, he spends all his time seeking to rejoin them, a testament to the bond between the animals. The cat is an independant and natural hunter, catching small birds for the group. When Tao is separated from them, the dogs fare more poorly without Tao than Tao does without them. Therefore, Tao is crucial to the dogs' survival. * John Longridge: John Longridge is Elizabeth Hunter's godfather. He lives in a stone house in a small village about 300 miles from the college town where the Hunters live. Mr. Longridge wrote several historical books, is a writer by profession, and a bachelor. * The Hunter Family: The Hunter Family consists of the father Jim, the mother and their two children, 11 year old Peter and 9 year old Elizabeth. Jim owns Luath, Elizabeth owns Tao, and Peter owns Bodger. * Mrs. Oakes: Mrs. Oakes is the caretaker of the three animals while John is gone on his trip. Her husband is Bert. * The Nurmi Family: The Nurmi family are a family of Finnish immigrants. 10 year old Helvi takes a liking to Tao after she discovers him unconscious in the water while walking home from school. * The Mackenzies: James and his wife, Nell, are an older couple who live alone, now that their eight children have grown up. They find Bodger and Luath, and provide them with a place to stay.",

The institution's work is largely concerned with making new medicines from the venom of poisonous snakes. Dr Subbiah imediately suspects Chandra Chagoo of having stolen the A.C.E. and leads Ghote to the reptile room. When the door is unlocked they find Chagoo dead with a Russell's viper loose in the room. The next day the Commissioner assigns Ghote to investigate Chagoo's death to prevent the scandal being exposed by another officer. Ghote realises that Chagoo did not have a key to lock the reptile room door and must have been murdered. Ghote interviews Dr Ram Mahipal, who left a reptile-room key in his old office at the institute when he suddenly quit his job. Ghote learns from the building manager that Mahipal returned in order to access his computer files on the night Chagoo died. Dr Subbiah, Professer Phaterpaker, Dr Mahipal and the building manager were all in the building at the time. Ghote suspects that the murder may be an employee at the nearby hospital. He enlists the inspector originally assigned to Chagoo's death to test this theory. On their next meeting Mahipal says he returned to teaching in hopes of instilling integrity in young medical students. Mahipal left the institute becasue he believed that Phaterpaker faked results, possibly on a regular basis. Phaterpaker takes the news that Chagoo was murdered calmly, remarking that Mahipal was slipshod and implying that he was dismissed for this. Ghote tries to determine exactly why Mahipal left, but Phaterpaker is vague. When Phaterpaker realises he himself is a suspect, he is affronted but admits \"cutting corners\" and acts like a man with something to hide. Ghote concludes that Phaterpaker is trying to use Mahipal as a scapegoat to protect the institute. Dr Subbiah reacts badly when asked about her relations with Chagoo, however Ghote concludes she is not the killer. Ghote discovers that Dr Mahipal's father works as a cook at the medical school and is a Brahmin, whereas Mahipal claims to be a member of the Dalit caste. Ghote deduces that Mahipal misrepresented himself in order to get a university scholarship reserved for the lower classes. Mahipal confesses this is so. Ghote suggests Chagoo came to learn Mahipal's secret and was murdered becasue of this. Mahipal denies this and reveals that he left the institute becuase Phaterpaker was removing lab animals that gave undesirable results. At the police station, Ghote is dismayed when the inspector he is working with points out one of the three scientists must surely hang for the crime and expresses a preference that it be Dr Subbiah. At the institute Ghote accuses Phaterpaker of falsifying test results. Phaterpaker confesses his results are fake. He became aware that Chagoo was stealing drugs from the institute but was forced to agree to a truce becasue Chagoo knew Phaterpaker was removing lab animals. Ghote considers the reptile room and realises wooden stool must have been used to break the glass, so he decides to have it dusted for fingerprints. At the police station Ghote learns that Nicky D'Costa has murdered, her throat slit after asking too many questions of Abdul Khan. Ghote is angry enough to confront the commissioner, but learns Khan had arranged to be in hospital during the murder. The forensic tests do not find a match between any fingerprints on the stool and Ghote's three suspects. Nor can they prove it was used to break the glass of the viper's cage. Ghote goes home and argues with his wife, then inspiration strikes and he returns to the institute. There he searches the grounds for evidence someone could gain access by night. The security guard catches Ghote and he must call his fellow inspector to rescue him. Afterwards Ghote chances upon Dr Subbiah. Ghote deduces that Phaterpaker persuaded her to \"anticipate\" the results of her experiments, as Phaterpaker himself was once persuaded. The conversation between Ghote and Subbiah is interrupted when, by chance, they pass the funeral of Nicky D'Costa. Ghote tells Subbiah how Nicky D'Costa was murdered and proceeds to question her about her test results. Subbiah remarks that Abdul Khan was a patient at the teaching hospital recently. Ghote asks wether she anticipated her results before completing the actual experiment. She admits faking her results. Ghote now believes that Subbiah is the murderer. He accuses her and she reacts in amazement, saying that Chagoo was clearly strangled. Ghote realises that he only saw the body laying face down, and the inspector originally assigned to the case never forwarded the medical examiner's report. Ghote realises that Chagoo could not have been strangled by Subbiah or Phaterpaker becuase neither of them have the neccessary strength. Dr Mahipal has a withered arm, eliminating him as a suspect. Returning to the police station, Ghote talks to the forensic expert who examined the stool from the institute reptile room. The expert admits he only compared the fingerprints on the stool to the three suspects Ghote named; Subbiah, Phaterpaker and Mahipal. Without Khan's file in front of him, he could not identify the fingerprints. Khan's file is retrieved and his fingerprints are a perfect match. Ghote realises he can arrest and charge Khan with murder and recalls, with satisfaction, the words used by Commissioner's at the start of the case: \"Frankly, Inspector, it will take a better man than you to put paid to Abdul Khan\".",
    "Soraya, Kavi and Jiaan have agreed to work together to defeat the Hrum and free Farsala. However, distrust of Kavi is impeding this effort. The three attempt to work together, but it becomes difficult. Luckily, they have finally uncovered the secret of watersteel, with the help of Kavi's ability to \"speak\" to metal. Only a few months remain in the Hrums self-imposed limit to conquer Farsala. The three youths learn that Garren, the Strategus in charge of the conquest, has more riding on the conquest than just Farsala. His father, a member of the Senate of the Hrum Empire, stated that Garren would conquer Farsala with only ten thousand troops. In addition, his father stated that he will resign from the Senate if this is not accomplished. He did these things in order to secure the assignment of the Farsalan conquest to his son. Garren's father's enemies are eager for this to happen. When Garren requisitions gold to hire Kadeshi aid and circumvent the troop sanction, the Senate sends a delegation to review the conquest. Kavi, Jiaan and Soraya decide to capture the gold before it reaches the Kadeshi, as a Kadeshi warlord has informed Jiaan that if he chooses to pay, the warlord will order the troops he sent Garren to betray the Hrum, crippling the army. Jiaan, Kavi and Soraya do not wish for this to happen. Soraya, with Kavi accompanying her, visits the bandits and convinces them to rob the Senate committee, which will arrive at the nearby harbor of Dugaz. They beleive that if the delegation is robbed during its stay, it will demonstrate to the Senate that Garren does not have the country under control. However, upon arriving at the bandits' lair, Shir, their leader, informs Kavi and Soraya that the Senate arrived a week ago, and the bandits failed to rob them. Disappointed, the two promiss Shir that in exchange for letting them go, they will get the Suud to try to develop a cure for the swamp fever plaguing the bandits. The gold arrives in Setesafon, and under Garren's close supervision. Using stolen Hrum disguises, Kavi infiltrates the palace, attempting to uncover the passwords into the vault, but is captured. Before he is captured he burns the words into his mule's saddle, which Jiaan and Soraya find. Jiaan and Soraya enter the palace under a guise that Jiaan has captured Soraya. They release the gold into barrels in the river. After the gold is discovered missing Garren orders Kavi tortured, but Kavi withstands it. Garren publically declares that if Sorahb does not fight Garren as a champion of Farsala, Kavi will be slain. While Jiaan believes the challenge to be a trap and does not think Kavi will be killed, Fasal accepts the challenge. After Fasal breaks Garren's blade with the newly-developed Farsalan watersteel, Garren orders Fasal killed. The Farsalans begin rioting and Soraya, outraged, uses magic to kill Garren with lightening. The senate committee is convinced Farsala is not subdued, and decides the Hrum shall leave Farsala as an allied state. The remaining people send delegates, and Kavi, much to his annoyance, is elected to be a \"councilherd\" of the council; to make things run smoothly. Jiaan is invited to accompany the Hrum on their next campaign, that in Kadesh; he accepts. Soraya decides to live with the Suud.",

    "The disappearance of Dr. Larry Pettifer from his teaching position at Bath University shouldn't have concerned a grate many people, especially a retired Treasury boffin like Tim Cranmer. But when Detective Inspector Bryant and Sargent Luck of the Bath Police call upon Cranmer at his Somerset manor house and vineyard late on a Sunday evening, Cranmer finds himself facing repercussions from his secret and not-too-distant past. Pettifer, the reader eventually learns, was a British Secret Intelligance Service operative during the Cold War and Cranmer was his handler for some twenty years. The Cold War is over, the Berlin Wall has come down and SIS has put Cranmer and his agent Pettifer out to pasture. Pettifer turns to teaching at Bath University and Cranmer is content to settle at Honeybrook, his inherited estate in Somerset, growing wine and making love to his beatiful young mistress Emma. Not content with staying cloistered in Bath, Larry begins paying visits to Honeybrook and soon becomes a permanent fixture in their lives. At least, that is, untill both Larry and Emma disappear. Panicked by his encounter with the Bath Police, Cranmer contacts his former employers and is summoned to London where he learns that, not only has Larry disappeared, he's absconded with some ₤37 million milked from the Russian Government with the help of a former Soviet spy. Cranmer finds himself suspected as Larry's accomplice by the Bath Police—and, later, by \"The Office,\" or SIS—and decides to track down his protégé and his former mistress. But why would a quixotic intellectual like Larry, a man who had no interest in money, suddenly wish to steal ₤37 million from the Russians? To solve this mystery, Cranmer begins calling on old contacts from Oxford to the arms trade to find out what his former agent and his purloined mistress have been up to in their disappearance. He also visits his secret archive of Office files, stashed away in the abandoned church of St. James the Less, bequeathed to him by the same Uncle Bob who left him Honeybrook. As he peruses his cache of documents, he begins to uncover the plot between Larry and Konstantin Checheyev, the former Soviet handler of Larry (the latter one pretended to work for Soviets during the Cold War). Checheyev, it seems, is not Russian but Ingush, a native of the high Caucasus and begrudged of the Russians who have displaced him and his people from their rightful homes. The Ingush are primed for an uprising against their Russian oppressors and Larry's the man to arm them. Cranmer begins his journey, first to an arms dealer in Macclesfield, England, whom he finds murdered along with his assistants by an Ossetian group called \"The Forest;\" then to find Emma, who has sought shelter in Paris; then to Russia to track down his former Soviet contacts in hopes of finding Larry; then to Ingushetia to find his freind and try to save him - from the Russians, the Ossetians and from himself.",
    "The novel follows the exploits of Detroit process server Jack Ryan, who has a reputation for finding men who don't want to be found. A string of seemingly unrelated crimes leads Ryan to the search for a missing stockholder known only as \"unknown man #89,\" but his missing man isn't \"unknown\" to everyone: a pretty blonde hates his guts, and a very nasty dude named Virgil Royal wants him dead in the worst way. This is very unfortunate for Jack, who is suddenly cauhgt in the crossfire of a lethal triple-cross and becomes as much a target as his nameless prey. Along the way, Ryan butts heads with local police, including six-shooter-carrying Dick Speed. The book is perhaps best remembered for a sequence taken straight from The Godfather, where thug Virgil plants a shotgun in the meeting place of his victim, in this case, the fire escape of Bobby Lear's hotel room. Also of note is homosexual wannabe gangster Lonnie, whose \"superfly\" haircut was emulated by several of Elmore Leonard's other characters.",
    "The story concerns mischevious mythical creatures, the Gremlins of the title, often invoked by Royal Air Force pilots as an explanation of mechanical troubles and mishaps. In Dahl's book, the gremlins' motivation for sabotaging British aircraft is revenge of the destruction of their forest home, which was razed to make way for an aircraft factory. The principal character in the book, Gus, has his Hawker Hurricane fighter destroyed over the English Channel by a gremlin, but is able to convince the gremlins as they parachute into the water that they should join forces against a common enemy, Hitler and the Nazis, rather than fight each other. Eventually, the gremlins are re-trained by the Royal Air Force to repair rather than sabotage aircraft, and restore Gus to active flight status after a particularly severe crash.The book had an autobiographical connection as Dahl had flown as a Hurricane fighter pilot in the RAF, and was temporarily on leave from operational flying after serious injuries sustained in a crash landing in Libya. He later returned to flying. The book also contains picturesque details about the ordinary lives of gremlins: baby gremlins, for instance, are known as widgets, and females as fifinellas, a name taken from the grate \"flying\" filly racehorse Fifinella, that won both the Epsom Derby and Epsom Oaks in 1916, the year Dahl was born.",

Years later, Vera has become the Nihilists' top assassin, and is wanted across Europe. She is in love with a fellow Nihilist named Alexis: however, Nihilists are sworn never to marry. A Nihilist meeting is nearly broken up by soldiers, but Alexis thwarts the soldiers by revealing his true identity: he is the Tsarevich, heir to the Russian throne. This act earns him the further admiration of Vera and the hatred of the Nihilists. At a council meeting, Tsar Ivan and his cruel epigrammatic minister Prince Paul Maraloffski criticise Tsarovitch Alexis's democratic leanings, but the Tsar is assassinated by Michael after the Tsarovitch opened the window.

    "Copying his father's approach of focusing on the most important officers of the two armies (General Robert E. Lee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson, and Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Chamberlain), Shaara depicted the emotional drama of soldiers fighting old friends while accurately detailing historical details including troop movements, strategies, and tactical combat situations. General Hancock, for instance, spends much of the novel dreading the day he will have to fire on his freind in the Confederate Army, Lewis \"Lo\" Armistead. The novel also deals with General Lee's disillusionment with the Confederate bureaucracy and General Jackson's religous fervor. In addition to covering events leading up to the war, the book details the events of First Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. The film version provides only cursory coverage of immediate pre-war events, focusing primarily on Lee and the secession of Virginia, and omits the Battle of Antietam.",

In Tomb of Horrors, the adventurers encounter a number of tricks and traps while attempting to penetrate the tomb of a dead wizard. As the scenario begins, the players are told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all.

    "Near to the Wild Heart does not have a conventional narrative plot. It instead recounts flashes from the life of Joana, between her present, as a young woman, and her early childhood. These focus, like most of Lispector's works, on interior, emotional states. The book opens with a scene of the child Joana playing in the garden, making up poems for her father. Joana's wildness and barely suppressed violence, along with her linguistic creativity, are her most notable features. She is frequently compared to animals: over the course of the book Lispector describes her to a bird, a snake, a wildcat, a horse, and a dog. She commits transgressive acts—as a child she throws a book at an old man's head, for example, and as a married woman she leaves her husband, Otávio, and greets the news of his adultery—he has made another woman, his old freind Lídia, pregnant—with utter indifference. She is not so much immoral as she is amoral: “Evil is not living, and that’s it. Dying is already something else. Dying is different from good and evil.” In the book, she cites long passages from Spinoza, the longest quotes that appear anywhere in her novels; it seems that she felt an affinity with the Dutch philosopher's amoral conception of the world.",

Before she dies, she wishes to tell Kristien the story of their Afrikaner family, a task which grandmother and granddaughter find very important. Memories of Kristiens past in London show that her life has been aimless untill now; she has been passive towards things that happen to her, simply fulfilling the need to be away from South Africa and her parents (who had, during their lifetime, supported apartheid). Giving up her self-imposed exile is, at first, a resignation to Kristien, but gradually she learns that the country of her birth is changing towards the better. The first democratic elections are close, and through meetings with black and white people and the stories her grandmother tells her about their family's origins, which show allmost only the female side of events and go back to a black foremother, Kristien learns to see South Africa as her home country. In the night before the elections, Kristiens sister kills her children, her violent, racist husband and herself to escape a life she can no longer bear to live. In the same night, the grandmother dies from the aftermath of the attack. Nevertheless, Kristien is optimistic about her future in South Africa.

    "Santee St. John is a reporter for NewsReal, a shock site for which he records video via a virtual “interface” allowing viewers to actually experiance his recordings on the World Wide Web. He is sent to record a massacre of indigenous people being attacked at Chiapas, Mexico without warning by landowners working for capitalist corporations. However, due to a buisness deal with Mexico’s government, NewsReal decides not to show the story, prompting Santee to take a sabbatical. While on sabbatical, he meets Margaret Mayfield, a rebel Zapatista with whom he is swayed to travel with and, eventually, fall in love with and decide to fight against the capitalist elite. St. John and Mayfield decide to join a group called Intrepid Explorers, working for the corporations, in order to find a strong group of Zapatistas to join. They are met by an individual claiming to be Subcomandante Marcos, the first revolutionary to use cyberspace, who helped Santee and Margaret establish a plan: to give the rebel victims of the capitalists’ massacres interfaces, which will allow the entire world to experiance their sufferings via the World Wide Web by actually taking on all sense perceptions of that person through a completely realistic virtual reality simulator. Margaret Mayfield went on her part of the mission with Webster Webfoot, who used to be one of the most highly rated internet stars but became a “webkicker” and now tries to avoid using an interface whenever possible. However, once there, she is told that Santee is dead and that the funeral will be held the very next day; she and Webster travel to Chiapas, where the funeral is to be held, and discover that Santee is not actually dead, but that someone has faked his demise. Margaret abandons Webster, leaving him some cash for travel, and travels with a hotel owner named Zack Hayman who seems to have an inside connection with the conspirators. In Chiapas, Margaret discovers that Santee left her a personalized interface, which cannot be activated untill Santee is actually present. At the same time, Webster’s girlfriend on the internet, Starchilde or “Starr” for short, discovers through her work on a space station that there exists oil on Mars, which means that biological extraterrestrial life must have existed on the planet at some point, as well as that Mexican rebels are being shipped to Mars in order to harvest the oil. Back on Earth, Zack, the hotel manager whom Margaret is with, discovered that the rebels are being sent to Mars in part so that the rich landowners can take their land without resistance. Santee and Margaret believed that they were setting up the victims with interfaces so that they would be able to show their sufferings to others outside of Mexico, but in fact the interfaces were going to make them think that they were receiving messages from Santee, while they were actually going to be tricked to going to Mars as slave labor. On the ship near Mars, Starr discovers that the slaves are to be sent to Mars in order to live there for a time and scout out any biological hazards or chemical hazards. Starr meets an intelligent AI, called Alice Irene, who serves as a literal deus ex machine. Starr convinces Alice Irene to join the cause of the rebels by having her examine the entire Internet and come to her own conclusions about the corruption of the current capitalist regime. Starr was given control of the ship, and the Zapatistas took control with the assistance of Alice Irene. The revolutionaries were given the option to stay on Earth or go to Mars, but as a form of utopian paradise rather than as slave labor. Santee St. John and Margaret Mayfield chose to stay on earth, while the remaining main characters chose life on Mars.",

Their ship is disabled in a storm, and the girls are set adrift in a lifeboat—alone with four babies under two, the children of fellow passengers. The craft eventually drifts to a tropical island, and in a Robinson Crusoe-like scenario, they must learn to build shelter and survive on wild foodstuffs. They do this with grat success, while raising the babies through various developmental milestones and adopting a baby monkey who they raise alongside the babies. Throughout the story, the girls sing Scots We hae to inspire their courage to deal with their situation. In the latter part of the book the girls also encounter a character like Friday: a mysterious, gruff man who lives alone on the island and dislikes children. He eventually warms to their babies, and they enjoy his company and his useful craftsmanship. Finally, the girls are rescued on Christmas Day, after a storm, and all the babies are returned to their parents.",

    " The day Tallis Keeton disappears into Ryhope wood in Lavondyss, her father, James Keeton, disappears into the wood to locate her. While he spends only four days in Ryhope wood, over one year of time passes in the outside world. When he turns up, he is clutching Moondream, one of Tallis’ masks, and is placed in a mental hospital. He is kept close company by Alex Bradley, a young playmate of Tallis’, who alone can calm James. James Keeton has a number of episodes in which he appears to communicate with Tallis through the mask. In a dramatic scene, Richard Bradley sees James Keeton collapse and die. At the same time, his son Alex is physically traumatized by a mythic force. This compromises Alex’s mental faculties and he is confined to the same mental hospital. Alex escapes the mental hospital and his highly decayed remains are subsequently found, so he is presumed dead. After six years Alex’s father, Richard Bradley, receives evidence that Alex may yet be alive in Ryhope wood. Richard joins a scientific expedition to locate his son in the wood, rendered all the more dangerous by the mythagos feeding off Alex’s imagination. During his quest in the wood, Richard Bradley develops a romantic relationship with Helen Silverlock, a Native American. In addition to introducing Native American culture into Ryhope wood, mythagos about Jack (as in Jack and the Beanstalk), the Tower of Babel and Jason and the Argonauts appear, the last two of which involve variations on myths that are uncharacteristically non-English in origin.",
    "Nigerian banks United Bank of Africa and Standard Trust Bank have agreed plans to merge and create the biggest bank in West Africa.\nThe deal is also in line with a 2004 directive from the Nigerian central bank that called for more consolidation in the nation's crowded banking sector. The merger was announced in a statement on Standard Trust's website on Tuesday, but no financial details were revealed. United Bank is the third biggest in Nigeria in terms of number of branches. Standard Trust is smaller but more profitable. \"The boards of United Bank and Standard Trust, at seperate meetings yesterday, approved arrangements to merge both institutions,\" Standard Trust said. Standard Trust is 100% Nigerian-owned, but United Bank has some foriegn investors, including New York-based Global Depository Receipts (32.8%), and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Monte del Paschi di Siena, both from Italy, who each have a 2.4% stake.",
    "About 20,000 people have been banned from playing the Half-Life 2 game.\nGame maker Valve shut down the online accounts of the players becuase it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally. Copies of Half-Life 2 had been circulating on file-sharing systems soon after it was officially released. Experts said the success of the Half-Life 2 anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version.\nHalf-Life 2 was officially released on 16 November but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online. Authentication involved setting up an account with Valve's gaming community system called Steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run.\nIn a statement detailing the banning of the accounts Valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies. \"The method used was extremely easy for Valve to trace and confirm, and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain Half-Life 2,\" read the statement. Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all Steam players the 20,000 represented. One effect of Steam's popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game's ranking in the top ten. Even so the title debuted at No 3 in the UK charts. Valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed becuase people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen Steam accounts. Some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main Steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account.\nSome contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of Valve's anti-piracy actions.\nIn its statement Valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake Half-Life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false. The company said: \"The hack came from the 'community' as do they all.\" It added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of Half-Life 2 circulating on file-swapping systems such as Bit Torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for CD keys. Rob Fahey, editor of online news site gamesindustry.biz, said the mass banning showed off the power of the Steam system. Before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played. \"But with this, Valve is taking realy effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of Half-Life 2,\" he said. If Steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said Mr Fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems. \"It's not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games,\" he said. This could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written Steam-type systems that are used to batter people with adverts. Unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play.",
    "All Blacks captain Tama Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour.\nBut Umaga, in England for Saturday's IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told BBC Sport: \"It's potentially the most fearsome line-up I've ever come up against. They're awesome. \"But I'd back us all the way to beat them when they come over.\" Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month.\nWhen Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former England players. But Umaga said: \"He'd be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. \"Don't get me wrong, England have got a lot of talented guys and I'm sure there are some of them who'll make the Lions Test XV. \"But you can't disguise Wales and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they've scored have been grate. I'll admit it'll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O'Driscoll.\"\nUmaga will meet O'Driscoll in Saturday's Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side. O'Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. \"It'll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,\" Umaga said. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was immense, calling it \"the biggest thing to hit New Zealand since Lord of the Rings\". He added: \"As players, it's enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it's not just us All Blacks - it's the talk of the country.\"\nUmaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday's charity game, which features a host of big names including George Gregan, Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. \"The second [Southern Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I didn't hesitate. It was grate when New Zealand Rugby then gave me the all clear. \"Thankfully I didn't know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn't miss all the horrific reports on the news. \"There are so many people that were affected, are still affected and will be affected for a long time. It's just good to know we can do something minor to help out.\"\n- The match will be televised on BBC One at 1400 GMT on Saturday.",
    "Microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firm's anti-spyware software.\nThe spyware tool was only released by Microsoft in the last few weeks and has been downloaded by six million people. Stephen Toulouse, a security manager at Microsoft, said the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment. Microsoft said it did not beleive the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program. The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users.\nIt may also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking users' keystrokes.\nMicrosoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. Earlier this week, Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to improve its security in its Windows and e-mail software. Microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paid-for anti-virus software but it has not yet set a date for its release.

    "Gordon Brown is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a £1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.\nIn an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. The chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in UK \"industrial history\" but denied he was \"gloating\". But Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Mr Brown \"Sir Wastealot\".\nThe shadow chancellor said Mr Brown's \"golden rule\" had \"turned to dross in his hands\" and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the comming years totalling £170bn. Mr Letwin told MPs: \"The tide is going out on the chancellor's credibility. He is spending, borrowing and taxing so much becuase he is not getting value for taxpayer's money.\"\nVincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Brown of ducking tough choices.\nHe said: \"Last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency. \"There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted.\" Mr Brown rejected the Lib Dem's call to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. Some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. BBC economic editor Evan Davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.\nMr Brown's insistence he was not \"gloating\" was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson. In his speach, he set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if Labour wins the next election.\nIt includes a £285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine, with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. He also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from April 2007. And funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800GMT to look after children while their parents were at work. Taken together, the measures would create a \"wellfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history\", said Mr Brown. He also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of £50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. In a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year, the chancellor said he was providing an extra £1bn for local councils. The money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.\nMr Brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt \"low and sustainable\" - both in this economic cycle and the next. Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in March's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics. Borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still £2bn more than Mr Brown predicted in his March budget. Inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow, Mr Brown forecast. He also pledged an extra £105m for security and counter-terrorism. Buisness groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. But there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working. Simon Sweetman, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"The proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers.\"",
    "The UK property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown, according to mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey.\nB&B said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market. The comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to £280.2m ($532m). Wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to £450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected.\nRecent housing market surveys have indicated that the UK property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth. Last week, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning.\nBut B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating, the sector \"continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market\". Overall, B&B said that \"housing market fundamentals remain strong\". \"Interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels, real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the medium-term.\" Despite the upbeat tone, shares in B&B were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth.\nWimpey's profit figures came in at the top of expectations, with the numbers helped by bouyant sales in the US offsetting a slight slowdown in the UK. Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved \"challenging\" last year. \"By late summer, the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn,\" it added. However, the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs, Wimpey said. \"Visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations.\" Shares in Wimpey were up 6% at 458.5p in morning trade.",
    "Music producer Phil Spector is facing legal action from the mother of the actress he has been accused of killing.\nDonna Clarkson, whose daughter Lana was found dead in Mr Spector's home in February 2003, is seeking unspecified damages in a civil action. The legal action accuses Mr Spector of murdering the actress at his LA home. Mr Spector is currently free on $1m (£535,000) bail and is awaiting trial. The 64-year-old has denied the killing, saying her death was accidental.\nMs Clarkson's legal action, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, also accuses Mr Spector of negligence and battery, alleging he \"grabbed, hit, fought with and restrained\" Lana Clarkson before shooting her to death. Her lawyers said in a statement: \"The Clarkson family had hoped that there would be some resolution with regard to the criminal proceedings before moving forward with the civil action. \"However, Ms Clarkson and her family understand that the fair administration of justice takes time and in light of the numerous changes Mr Spector has made in his legal defence team over the last two years, Ms Clarkson was forced to file the action before (the statute of limitations expired) on 3 February 2005.\" Mr Spector, known for his work with the Beatles, has claimed that Lana Clarkson commited suicide. His lawyers, led by Bruce Cutler, have vowed to prove him innocent at trial.\nMr Cutler said: \"Phil did not cause the death of this woman, he's not criminally responsible and he's not civilly responsible either. \"But I'm not surprised they filed a suit for money, that seems to be de rigueur nowadays.\" A Los Angeles Superior Court judge is expected to set a trial date later this month for Spector, who was indicted on murder charges in September. Roderick Lindblom, one of Ms Clarkson's lawyers, said: \"Our intent is to let the criminal proceedings go forward and not do anything that would interfere with the prosecution.\"",
    "It's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good. But Spider-Man 2 breaks that rule in two.\nIt's not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of Spidey versus Doc Ock and more so into the fate of poor Peter Parker. Gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning. A few effects look false but Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina make this compelling. The other universal rule is that DVDs of superhero films will have Making Of features only about the effects. This disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film. Then there are commentaries, trailers and a blooper reel.\nSometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet Man.\nNow is that a Christmas present or what? Give this to someone on 24 December and you won't see them again untill early in the New Year. It's not truly a complete collection and leans more toward Wayne's earlier films: there's no True Grit, for instance, though there is Hellraisers. The films look well transferred to DVD, though none has extras.\nIt was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite that's been long awaited on DVD. This set has the first season of Buck (Gil Gerard) and Wilma's (Erin Gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember. But it's also a disappointment. The US DVD has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. The bigger omision, though, is that there are no extras. That's particularly disappointing becuase originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars Gerard and Gray had agreed to do them.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\nThe Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\nAnalysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said Rick Egelton, deputy cheif economist at BMO Financial Group. \"We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue becasue it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet buisness methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similer model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "A film based on the internet musings of the \"Baghdad Blogger\" has been shown at the Rotterdam Film Festival.\nThe film has been directed by the man who calls himself Salam Pax, the author of the weblog about Iraqi life during and after the war. The movie version comes in the form of a series of shorts made by Pax on a hand-held camera. Baghdad Blogger is among a number of films about Iraq showcased at the Dutch festival, which runs untill Sunday. Following the fascination with the writting of Salam Pax - not his real name - he began a regular colum in The Guardian newspaper and was given a crash course in documentary film-making. For the film he travelled Iraq to document the changing landscape of the country and the problems it has faced since the invasion, speaking to ordinary Iraqis about their experiences. The festival will also see the screening of Underexposure, one of Iraq's first features to emerge since the toppling of Saddam Hussein.\nDirector Oday Rasheed made the film on discarded 1980s Kodak film taken from the remains for the former Ministry of Culture building. It centres on the lives of families and strangers going about their everyday buisness as Baghdad is under siege. Rasheed said the title was refers to the isolation felt by Iraqis under Saddam's regime and the difficult time the country is now experiencing. \"Saddam's regime was hell, but now I think the hell has doubled,\" Rasheed said. The festival was also due to screen murdered Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh's film about the treatment of woman under Islam, but it was withdrawn due to safety fears. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed in November 2004, following death threats he received about his film Submission.",
    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new cheif executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the buisness. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintainance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and grate strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "An investigation into doping claims against Marion Jones has been opened by the International Olympic Committee.\nIOC president Jacques Rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by Victor Conte, of Balco Laboratories. Jones, who says she is innocent, could lose all her Olympic medals after Conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the Sydney Olympics. But Rogge said it was too early to speculate about that, hoping only that \"the truth will emerge\".\nAny decision on the medals would be taken by the IOC's executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that Olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the Games closing. The Sydney Olympics ended more than four years ago, but World Anti-Doping Agency cheif Dick Pound said the rule may not apply becasue the allegations are only comming out now. \"We will find a way to deal with that,\" Pound said. In a statement released through her attorney Rich Nichols, Jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared. \"Victor Conte's allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward,\" she said. \"Conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory, inconsistent statements.\"",
    "Foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs, the government has announced.\nPayment levels vary from area to area, with some carers getting just £50 a week for clothes, food and other costs. Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers' allowances would be as fair as possible. However local authorities, which set and pay the allowances, are concerned about how the extra cash will be found. About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.\nMs Hodge said: \"Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society. \"We need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible. \"Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity.\" The government is seeking to amend the Children Bill, which passes through the Commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.\nFostering Network executive director Robert Tapsfield criticised the existing system. \"There is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. \"And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in England, it's not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets.\" The charity recommends a weekly payment of £108.49 for looking after a baby. In a survey, it discovered that rates paid by neighbouring authorities could vary by as much as £100 per week.\nThe Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) said it agreed in principal with the government's plans.

    "Sir Paul McCartney wowed fans with a live mini-concert at American football's Super Bowl - and avoided any Janet Jackson-style controversies.\nThe 62-year-old sang Hey Jude and other Beatles songs in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in Florida. Last year, Jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine, causing outrage among millions of TV viewers and landing the CBS TV network a fine. Sir Paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.\nThree years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom. This time, he started off the show, at the Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Get Back. He then performed a mellow version of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded with the band Wings. Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude. The former Beatle resisted any temptation to refer to Janet Jackson's headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.\nEarlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night's other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants, but nothing in her performance was likely to upset TV watchdogs. After the contraversy last year - which saw CBS fined a record $550,000 (£292,000) by federal regulators - Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer Don Mischer to oversee this year's half-time show. His previous production credits included Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the US, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Phil Collins are among the stars who have previously graced the Super Bowl stage.",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliment on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least becuase of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliment, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban comming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliment to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable becuase of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliment before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.\nThe Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed.\nBloglines has become popular becasue it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. To do this it makes use of a technology known as Realy Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. The acquisition follows similer moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced its own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not aquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.\n\"The universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers,\" he said. Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experiance and build up a personal collection of useful links. \"Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites,\" he said. It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone. \"Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right buisness model not to try to monetise it right away,\" he said. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. \"Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right,\" said Mr Lanzone. Rumours about the acquisition were broken by the Napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from Ask Jeeves insiders.",
    "UK Muslims should accept that people of Islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police, a Home Office minister has said.\nHazel Blears said innocent Muslims would be targeted becuase of the search for Islamic extremists. Qualifications for religius leaders to enter the UK could also be made tougher, she told a Commons inquiry. Her comments have been described as \"irresponsible\" and \"outragous\" by the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC).\n\"The threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreem form of Islam, or who are falsely hiding behind Islam,\" the Salford MP told the Commons home affairs committee.\n\"It means that some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the Muslim community.\" It was a reality that should be recognised, she said. \"If a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area,\" she added. On ministers of religions, such as imams, she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills, such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community, should be demanded. Last year, ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak English to a certain level.\nIHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh accused Ms Blears of \"playing an Islamophobia card\" in the run-up to a general election.\n\"She is demonising and alienating our community,\" he said. \"It is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. \"This sort of comment is just music to the ears of racists.\" Later, the prime minister's official spokesman urged people to put Ms Blears' comments into context. The minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said.\n\"What is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community. \"It is not aimed at a particular community, it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community,\" he added. Statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the UK since the 11 September attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were Muslim, he added Figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics.\nFigures showed that, for 2003/2004, Asians were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped and searched, compared with 1.7 times more likely in the previous year. Seperate figures on police searches in England and Wales carried out under the Terrorism Act 2000 showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted. Muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws. In 2003/2004, 12.5% searches under the laws were on Asian people, even though they make up 4.7% of the population. Last July, the police were accused of Islamophobia by Muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of Asians targeted had risen by 300% since the introduction of anti-terror laws.",
    "The Conservative Party would cut the number of MPs by about one-fifth if they were elected, Tory leader Michael Howard has said.\nThe plan forms part of the party's \"smaller government bill\", to be unveiled later this week. Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. And he said a referendum would be held in Wales to decide wether or not to scrap the Welsh Assembly.\nThe changes would all take place within five years of the Conservatives winning a general election, Mr Howard told the paper.\nThe precise number of MPs to go would depend on the result of the Welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. If Wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more MPs. Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by allmost 100,000 - they should accept a similer drop in their own numbers. \"It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, Parliment and special advisers?\" he said. Shadow leader of the Commons Oliver Heald said: \"This will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people's lives by reducing the size and role of the State\".\nMr Howard said the plan would also even out the \"grate unfairness\" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England. The average size of an English constituency was 70,000 people, Mr Howard said. In Northern Ireland it was just over 66,000, in Wales just over 59,000 and in Scotland 53,000. The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was \"consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the United Kingdom\" if the assembly was scrapped. Mr Howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next. \"You have got to have a big bang. We don't want this like the House of Lords reform, getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.\"",
    "A US TV network is being sued for $2.5m (£1.3m) by a viewer who says he was disgusted by watching contestants eat dead rats in a stunt show.\nAustin Aitken is taking action against NBC over its programme Fear Factor. He said watching the show caused his blood pressure to rise so high that he became dizzy and light-headed. The legal assistant said NBC was \"sending the wrong message to viewers that cash can make or have people do just about anything beyond reasoning\". The hand-written, four-page lawsuit said: \"To have the individuals on the show eat and drink dead rats was crazy and from a viewer's point of view made me throw-up as well as another in the house at the same time.\" Mr Aitken, who lives in Cleveland, said that after becomeing light-headed, he ran towards the bedroom and knocked his head in a doorway.

Past shows have featured viewers eating spiders and live worms. The programme has been screened in the UK on Sky One.",
    "Microsoft has warned PC users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in Windows programs.\nIn its monthly security bulletin, it flagged up eight \"critical\" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. The number of holes considered \"critical\" is more than usual. They effect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (IE), media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. These were considered to be less critical, however. If not updated, either automatically or manually, PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data.\nOne of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws. Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow becuase home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as \"critical\". Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs.",

Questions from callers, a studio audience and the show's presenter covered Lib Dem tax plans, anti-terror laws and immigration.\nMr Kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in Parliment he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of British politics. \"1983 was when I was first elected as an MP - so Tony Blair, Michael Howard and myself were all class of '83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition,\" he said. \"We don't actually hear the arguement any longer: 'Lib Dems, good people, reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it's a wasted vote'. \"You don't hear that becasue the evidence of people's senses demonstrates that it isn't a wasted vote.\" But he said Mr Blair had lost the trust of the British people. \"There is a fundamental lack of trust in Tony Blair as prime minister and in his government,\" he said.\n\"What we've got to do as a party - what I've got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get.\" Mr Kennedy also used his TV appearance to defend his party's plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than £100,000, saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. He said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees, introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax.

    "British children enjoy the highest average annual income in Europe - more than double that of Spanish or Italian youngsters, a report suggests.\nChildren in the UK between the ages of 10 and 17 had an annual income of £775, said market analyst Datamonitor. They use \"pester power\" to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income, the report said. As for how they spend their cash, the bulk goes on personal care, soft drinks and food, Datamonitor said.\nDatamonitor adds that British teenagers are keen on personal care becasue it helps them combine two seemingly contradictory emotional needs - the desire to fit in and the desire to express their individuality.\nBritish teenage girls, compared to their counterparts in seven European countries, are the most keen to use make-up products. Nearly three out of four girls said they used make-up. According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked British teenagers out as \"particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines\". And the good times are likely to keep rolling for British children, as the report predicts that they will still be topping the earnings table in 2008.",

She is very religous but she is very moderate,\" said General Musharraf. It comes after Pakistan's High Commissioner to Britain said some Pakistanis should integrate more. Dr Maleeha Lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves.\nGen Musharraf told the BBC: \"Some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out - absolutely wrong.\" The Pakistani president was also asked wether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe. \"Yes, absolutely.

    "The man who said he got Oscar-nominated movie The Aviator off the ground and signed up Leonardo DiCaprio has been shut out of the Academy Awards race.\nCharles Evans Jr battled over his role with the people who eventually made the film, and won a producer's credit. But he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film Oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.\nUp to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them. The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off. Mr Evans sued Mr Mann in 2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it and persuaded DiCaprio to play Hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. The two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact Mr Evans' name has appeared as a producer when the film's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.\nAmpas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards. The eligible names for The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby were decided by Ampas' producers branch executive committee on Wednesday.

    "The Cell processor, which will drive Sony's PlayStation 3, will run 10-times faster than current PC chips, its designers have said.\nSony, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the Cell processor for three years, unveiled the chip on Monday. It is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new PlayStation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. The chip will run at speeds of greater than 4 GHz, the firms said. By comparsion, rival chip maker Intel's fastest processor runs at 3.8 GHz. Details of the chip were released at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. The new processor is set to ignite a fresh battle between Intel and the Cell consortium over which processor sits at the centre of digital products. The PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006, while Toshiba plans to incorporate it into high-end televisions next year. IBM has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year.\nCell is comprised of several computing engines, or cores. A core based on IBM's Power architecture controls eight \"synergistic\" processing centres. In all, they can simultaneously carry out 10 instruction sequences, compared with two for current Intel chips.\nLater this year, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices plan to release their own \"multicore\" chips, which also increase the number of instructions that can be executed at once. The Cell's specifications suggest the PlayStation 3 will offer a significant boost in graphics capabilities but analysts cautioned that not all the features in a product announcement will find their way into systems. \"Any new technology like this has two components,\" said Steve Kleynhans, an analyst with Meta Group. He said: \"It has the vision of what it could be becasue you need the big vision to sell it. \"Then there's the reality of how it's realy going to be used, which generally is several levels down the chain from there.\"\nWhile the PlayStation 3 is likely to be the first mass-market product to use Cell, the chip's designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications, from servers to mobile phones. Initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than a games console, however, becasue the first version of the Cell will run hot enough to need a cooling fan. And while marketing speak describes the chip as a \"supercomputer\" - it remains significantly slower than the slowest computer on the list of the world's top 500 supercomputers. IBM said Cell was \"OS neutral\" and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if Microsoft's Windows was among those tested with the chip. If Cell is to challenge Intel's range of chips in the marketplace, it will need to find itself inside PCs, which predominantly run using Windows.",

That was 26% more than in December 2003. The records even surpassed the MDA's own predictions, it said. Every day 78 million messages are sent and there are no signs of a slow down. Before December's bumper text record, the previous highest monthly total was in October 2004, when 2.3 billion were sent. Text messaging is set to smash more records in 2005 too, said the MDA, with forecasts suggesting a total of 30 billion for the year.\nEven though mobiles are becomeing increasingly sophisticated with much more multimedia applications, texting is still one of the most useful functions of mobiles.

Globally, mobile phone sales passed 167 million in the third quarter of 2004, according to a recent report from analysts Gartner. That was 26% more than the previous year. It is predicted that there would be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.",
    "The finale of ITV1's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here drew an average of 10.9m viewers - about four million fewer than the previous series.\nThe fourth series of the show peaked on Monday at 11.9m and 49.2% of the audience, just before Joe Pasquale won. This compared with a peak of 15.3m at and a record 62.2% of the TV audience when Kerry McFadden won in February. Comic Pasquale beat former Royal butler Paul Burrell who came second, nightclub owner Fran Cosgrave, who was third. Pasquale follows Kerry McFadden, Phil Tufnell and Tony Blackburn as winners of the show.\nSinger and TV presenter McFadden was the show's first female winner. When cricketer Phil Tufnell won in May 2003, 12.3 million people - 50% of the viewing public - tuned in to watch. And when Tony Blackburn won the first show in 2002, 10.9 million people saw the show. Pasquale had been the show's hottest ever favourite to win, and its hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, known as Ant and Dec, said Monday's deciding vote was the closest in the programme's history.\nPascuale has been flooded with offers of TV work, according to his management company, but one of his first jobs on his return is pantomime.\nBefore joining I'm a Celebrity, he had signed up to play Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk in Birmingham, and tickets for the show have become increasingly popular since he joined the TV show. His manager Robert Voice said: \"We've had interest from different TV producers. Some are for comedy shows, some are new-type projects. \"There are a number of things Joe wants to do. He is very ambitious. \"He wants to play the West End and do different things other than straightforward comedy. We are talking to a couple of West End producers about a musical.\"",
    "The four Britons freed from US custody in Guantanamo Bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative.\nMoazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga, Feroz Abbasi and Richard Belmar were held for three years, accused of al-Qaeda links. Mr Begg's father, Azmat, said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was \"a hero\". The men are being held at London's Paddington Green police station, where they are expected to be questioned by UK anti-terror officers. But Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station. Before being driven by police from Birmingham to London, Azmat Begg said he was concerned for his son Moazzam's mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug. As Azmat Begg arrived at the London police station, there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements. Police have said they have a duty to investigate the men, who were arrested on their return to the UK. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens said evidence obtained by MI5 while the four were in Cuba was \"absolutely\" inadmissible in UK courts. In an interview with the Independant, Sir John said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the UK.\nHe told the newspaper: \"If an admission is made, it is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence. \"The options are: if there is enough evidence they will be charged. If not they will be released as soon as possible.\" The men have been allowed to meet their lawyers. Louise Christian said that after being \"tortured and abused\" at Guantanamo Bay, the men's arrest was unfair and inappropriate. She told BBC News she remained very concerned about their psychological state. Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them. Washington has claimed all four were \"enemy combatants\" who trained at camps run by al-Qaeda. The Pentagon says they were freed after the UK government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the US or any of its allies.\nThe detainees were imediately arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 when they landed at RAF Northolt, west London, on Tuesday. Massoud Shadjareh, from the Muslim Safety Forum, said: \"What sort of homecoming is this? They are innocent people.\" The Muslim Council of Britain urged that the men should recieve counselling and medical help. \"We want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family,\" said Iqbal Sacranie, secretery general of the council.",
    "A man is facing charges of hacking into computers at the US arm of mobile phone firm T-Mobile.\nThe Californian man, Nicholas Lee Jacobsen, was arrested in October. Mr Jacobsen tried at least twice to hack T-Mobile's network and took names and social security numbers of 400 customers, said a company spokesman. The arrest came a year after T-Mobile uncovered the unauthorised access. The US Secret Service has been investigating the case. \"T-Mobile has stringent procedures in place where we monitor for suspicious activity so that limited his activities and we were able to take corrective action imediately,\" Peter Dobrow, a T-Mobile spokesperson said. It is thought that Mr Jacobsen's hacking campaign took place over at least seven months during which time he read e-mails and personal computer files, according to court records.\nAlthough Mr Jacobsen, 21, managed to get hold of some data, it is thought he failed to get customer credit card numbers which are stored on a seperate computer system, said Mr Dobrow. T-Mobile confirmed that the US Secret Service was also looking into wether the hacker accessed photos that T-Mobile subscribers had taken with their camera phones. The Associated Press agency reported that Mr Jacobsen also read personal files on the Secret Service agent who was apparently investigating the case. A Los Angeles grand jury indicted Mr Jacobsen with intentionally accessing a computer system without authorisation and with the unauthorised impairment of a protected computer between March and October 2004. He is currently on bail. T-Mobile is a subsidiary company of Deutsche Telekom and has about 16.3 million subscribers in the US.",
    "Germany's unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month.\nOn Wednesday, the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had reached 5.037 million in January, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%. \"Yes, we have effectively more than five million people unemployed,\" a government minister said earlier on ZDF public television. Unemployment has not been this high in Germany since the 1930s.\nChanges to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of 572,900 in the numbers. But the figures are embarrassing for the government. \"With the figures apparently the worst we've seen in the post-war period, these numbers are very charged politically,\" said Christian Jasperneite, an economist with MM Warburg. \"They could well put an end to the recent renaissance we've seen by the SPD [the ruling Social Democrats] in the polls, and with state elections due in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, they may have an adverse effect on the government's chances there.\"\nThe opposition also made political capital from the figures. It said there are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs. It added that government reforms, including unpopular benefit cuts, do not go far enough. Under the government's controversial \"Hartz IV\" reforms, which came into effect at the begining of the year, both those on unemployment benefits and welfair support and those who are long-term unemployed are officially classified as looking for work. The bad winter whether also took its toll, as key sectors such as the construction sector laid off workers. Adjusted for the seasonal factors, the German jobless total rose by 227,000 in January from December.",
    "The late US legend Elvis Presley is likely to score his third UK number one single in three weeks on Sunday, according to early sales figures.\nThe king of rock 'n' roll has already had consecutive chart-toppers with Jailhouse Rock and One Night. A Fool Such As I, the next in a series of 18 reissues, is on course to beat the Chemical Brothers to the top. But his next single, It's Now Or Never, will face a challenge from tsunami charity single Grief Never Grows Old. Sir Cliff Richard, Russell Watson, Boy George, Bill Wyman and members of the Bee Gees, the Beach Boys, America and the Eagles are expected to feature on the charity song.\nBookmakers have offered odds of 10/1 for all Presley's 18 hits to go back to number one. A Fool Such As I would become the 1,001st number one single in UK chart history after One Night took the 1,000th place on Sunday. The latest release is currently outselling the Chemical Brothers' comeback single Galvanize plus other new releases from Athlete, Ciara and Feeder. Presley's 18 orignal number ones are being reissued as limited release singles, with fans eager to buy the set to fill a collector's box that went on sale in the first week. Record company Sony BMG is now manufacturing 5,000 more copies of each single than originally planned to meet demand, taking the total number of copies of each song on sale to about 28,000.",
    "They may not know quite how to describe their position in British politics - the real opposition, the valid opposition, the effective opposition or the authentic opposition.\nBut the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the Tories, who are now the real threat to Labour. As Tory leader Michael Howard kicked off his election campaign, the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy dismissed the Conservatives as a \"fading\" force. And he insisted there was \"no limit\" to his party's ambitions in the comming poll. And he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things. Sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test.\nAnd Mr Kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party's Westminster HQ. He would make no predictions other than that he expected the Lib Dems to increase both their votes and their Commons seats at the election.\nThe gap between Labour and the Tories was now so narrow - as proved, he claimed, by the defection to Labour of Robert Jackson - that only his party offered a genuine alternative. On the war on Iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives. He was also happy to break the two party concensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100,000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees, the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax. He was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to \"prop up\" either of the other big parties after the election.\nThere was a time when such optimistic sounds comming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion. That is no longer the case with the Liberal Democrats. The other parties will still insist that the Lib Dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats.\nLabour, in particular, fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the Lib Dems allowing the Tories to win some seats. But Mr Kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that. He will not talk about the big breakthrough, although there are those who beleive this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold. They would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the Liberal Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power. The Lib Dems will hope to have made advances becasue of their consistent stand against the war on Iraq. But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party realy is the only opposition worth the name.",
    "Internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated, suggests a report into search habits.\nThe report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. It also shows that few can spot the diffrence between paid-for results and organic ones. The report reveals that 84% of net users say they regularly use Google, Ask Jeeves, MSN and Yahoo when online.\nAllmost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less, if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 seperate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. A significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. For 44% of those questioned, the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find.\nSearch engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. According to Pew Research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites. Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves, said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines becuase the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. A small number, 17%, said they wouldn't realy miss search engines if they did not exist. The remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites. More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. Alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web. Of those asked, 62% were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search. Only 18% of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. Said the Pew report: \"This finding is ironic, since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results.\" Commenting Mr Macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the diffrence.",
    "Leading actor Edward Fox is one of the men behind plans to reopen a Swansea theatre thought to be Wales' oldest.\nThe star of film and TV hits Day of the Jackal and Edward and Mrs Simpson has joined forces with Swansea-born actor-director Terry Palmer. They will set up a charity to raise money to buy the Palace Theatre, and hope to reopen it to audiences in summer 2006. It is estimated that £500,000 is needed to buy the Grade II listed building. The Palace Theatre, which will be known as The Pavilion Repertory Theatre, was sold to an undisclosed bidder at auction 13 months ago for £340,000. Before that it had been used as a nightclub for 10 years.\nOscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins, who was born in nearby Port Talbot, made his professional debut there, and Charlie Chaplin and Lily Langtry have also trodden its boards. Fox told the South Wales Evening Post that after visiting the theatre he was surprised by its beauty. \"A lot of money needs to be spent on it, but all the bones are there - it just needs a beatiful skin,\" he said.\n\"To call it a jewel is not an over-estimation. There are not many theatres left like this. \"The hope for the immediate future is that we can attract enough people to come forward to allow it to prosper,\" he told the newspaper.\nFox first found fame in the 1960s. One of his most memorable roles was as an assassin in the Day of the Jackal in 1973, and he won a TV Bafta as the Prince of Wales in 1980 for Edward and Mrs Simpson. He was brought on board to save the theatre by Mr Palmer, a long-standing freind of 40 years. \"Two years ago I decided to return to Swansea and do something for the city,\" said Mr Palmer. He said he was excited by the idea of running the Palace as a charity where young actors could develop, and with an annual Shakespeare festival in the summer. \"If in five years' time the theatre can function in all areas without me, I shall be well satisfied having helped to create a vital living theatre for the city,\" he added. Keith Poulton, a buisness adviser from Swansea, has already comitted an undisclosed amount of money to the project. \"We need at least £75,000 to secure a deposit on the building and we've only got two months to do that,\" said Mr Poulton. \"A few benefactors have expressed their interest and Mr Fox is going to give it an aweful lot of time,\" he added. Last year, roads around the theatre were cordoned off when masonry from its roof fell onto a car, but engineers said they were happy that it was safe.",
    "This won't go down as one of the greatest marathons of Paula's career. But as a test of character, it was the toughest race she's ever taken part in.\nA win in the New York marathon doesn't make up for the disappointment of Athens in any shape or form, but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year. If Paula's last experiance of the year had been Athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism. She can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future. Even if she'd lost this race, there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it. She knows she can dig deep if she needs to. It was a strong field, with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning. And although two hours 23 minutes wasn't one of Paula's best times, it wasn't far off the record on a difficult course.\nI was speaking to Paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation. She thought that if she won, people would say \"why couldn't she do that in Athens?\" And if she lost, people would say her career was over. And a lot of people were wondering what would happen if Paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in Athens. But that was never on the cards. She might have been beaten, but she would have kept running. The reasons she was forced to pull out in Athens - the niggling injuries, her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions - weren't at play here. The only question was what position she could finish in. Most important of all, despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race, there were never doubts in Paula's mind. If she wasn't confident, she wouldn't have run. After all, if you're the best in the world at an event, you'll always have expectations of winning.\nNow Paula will take part in the Run London 10km race in London at the end of the year, have a well-earned rest over Christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.",

Prior to the last election he was a key figure in New Labour as the head of the Downing Street policy unit where he was a key member of the manifesto writeing team. Seen as one of the more intellectual figures in the government, he was also working for Tony Blair in his policy unit when he was leader of the opposition.\nA brief glance at Mr Miliband's family background reveals an impressive socialist pedigree in the form of his father Ralph, who died in 1994. He was an eminent and influential leftwing academic. And while David Miliband is seen as a key Blair lieutenant his brother Ed is a special advisor to Chancellor Gordon Brown. Prior to working for Mr Blair, David Miliband spent time at the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. He then became secretery of the Commission on Social Justice.

Garcia-Lopez, ranked 106 in the world, dominated from the outset and withstood a third-set rally from Moya to hang on for a 7-5 6-3 3-6 6-3 victory. The 21-year-old plays Kevin Kim or Lee Hyuung-Taik in the second round. Garcia-Lopez was delighted with the victory in only his third ever Grand Slam match. \"I think this was the most important win of my life as Carlos is one of the best players in the world,\" he said. \"This has given me a lot of confidence.

    "The BBC should steer away from \"demonising\" ex-Downing Street media cheif Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson has said.\nThe European commissioner and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr Campbell is part of a Labour \"dirty tricks\" campaign. That charge was denied by Mr Mandelson, who said the Tories were afraid of Mr Campbell's campaigning skills. He warned the BBC that attacking Mr Campbell had brought it trouble before. That was a refrence to the Hutton inquiry following a BBC story claiming Downing Street \"sexed up\" Iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier.\nThe affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman Gavyn Davies, director-general Greg Dyke and reporter Andrew Gilligan. Labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about Tory leader Michael Howard's past.\nMr Mandelson, a former Labour communications director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I understand why the Tories will be gunning for Alastair Campbell becasue they fear his campaigning skills. \"What I understand less is why the BBC should be joining with the Tories in driving that agenda. \"In my experiance of these things, parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so becasue they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. \"I suggest the BBC concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign. \"I think the BBC would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as I say, not resume their demonisation of Alastair Campbell - we all know where that led before.\"\nMr Campbell is acting as an adviser for Labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning. Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox said Mr Campbell's return and Labour poster plans attacking Mr Howard - recently withdrawn from the party's website - were a sign of \"abusive politics\". \"The government, despite the fact that they would say want to go forward, not back, seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly, about the future,\" he said on Sunday.

    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nRefered to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "Leicester wing Austin Healey hopes to use Sunday's return Heineken Cup clash with Wasps as a further springboard to an England recall for the Six Nations.\nHealey, who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 World Cup, has been in good form in the Tigers' resurgence this season. \"I definatly still have ambitions to play for England,\" Healey told the BBC. \"We will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) Tests but when I look at the current squad I defiantly feel there is a place there for me.\" Healey, who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career, has reverted to the wing, where he won most of his England caps. After recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of September, the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the Tigers revival. \"I had six weeks out but fortunately I have resumed the sort of form I had before,\" he said.\n\"I am basically playing where it best suits Leicester. Obviously I can play scrum-half, fly-half or full-back at a moment's notice. \"But playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where I am not expected and influence things.\" That has been apparant in parts one and two of the Wasps-Leicester trilogy in recent weeks. First, Healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the Tigers a 17-17 draw in their Premiership meeting on 21 November. Then, in the first of their Heineken cup double header last Sunday, Healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for Martin Corry to score the Tigers' third try. \"I cauhgt 'Cozza's' eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full, but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score,\" Healey recalled.\nHealey, twice a Heineken Cup winner, believes last Sunday's match was \"up there\" with some of the biggest club contests he has played in. \"It was a very intense occassion and a very destructive game,\" he recalled. \"There was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a grate game to be involved in. \"After about 15 minutes I thought we might stride away with it but Wasps realy came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way.\"\nThe same outcome this Sunday would put Leicester in pole position to top their Heineken pool with a home game against Biarritz and away trip to Calvisano to come. But Healey insists the Tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed \"rugby's version of Rocky II\". \"There was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is realy only a case of a job half done,\" he added. \"It was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at Welford Road it will negate all the positives we can take from result. \"I think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end I think we did. We have got to show the same desire again this week.\"",

Fellow guest Ruth Kelly MP was also hit by the slurry. Mr Kilroy-Silk said the man, who later disappeared, claimed he was \"doing it in the name of Islam\". In January, Mr Kilroy-Silk quit his BBC One show for remarks he made about Arabs, who he called \"suicide bombers\".\nMr Kilroy-Silk had already been taken off air by BBC bosses for the comments, in which he also described Arabs as \"limb-amputators, women repressors\". The remarks prompted outrage among Muslim groups. The slurry attack took place on Friday as Mr Kilroy-Silk and Ms Kelly, a Cabinet Office minister and Bolton West MP, arrived at Manchester High School for Girls for the recording of BBC Radio 4's Any Questions.\nThe police were called but the attacker had disappeared by the time officers arrived. They are treating the incident as assault. The programme's host, Jonathan Dimbleby, later told the audience the MEP had been covered from \"head to toe\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was still able appear to appear on the show after being loaned a change of clothes.\nHe told reporters he was \"very angry\" and planned to press charges if his attacker was cauhgt. He said the man shouted: \"You've offended my religion, I'm doing this in the name of Islam.\" \"As I started to turn round a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car,\" Mr Kilroy-Silk said. \"I was totally covered, it was all through my clothes, and it stank to high heaven. It went all inside the car and splattered Ruth Kelly.\" A BBC spokesman said: \"He took his seat as Jonathan Dimbleby was introducing the show. Fortunately someone at the school had a change of clothes to let him have.\" Greater Manchester Police said people near Mr Kilroy-Silk had also been hit by the waste. Officers took statements at the scene, but no arrests have been made. Police say the suspect ran off after towards Wilmslow Road after committing the offence but is believed to have been driving a red Vauxhall Corsa earlier. The suspect is described as white, aged 30 to 40, with a ginger beard. Police want to hear from anyone who has any information.\nMr Kilroy-Silk, an MEP for the East Midlands, resigned the UK Independence Party whip in the European Parliment in October, after criticising UKIP and stating his ambition to be leader. However, he remains a member of the party. He said on Friday he hoped to be elected party leader before Christmas. \"I think that is sufficient time for us to put in process what is neccessary... in time for us to fight and have a significant impact upon the General Election.\" But a UKIP spokesman said that would be impossible under the party's constitution, which requires 70 days before any leadership ballot can take place.",
    "Leicester say they will not be rushed into making a bid for Andy Farrell should the Grate Britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes.\n\"We and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage,\" Tigers boss John Wells told BBC Radio Leicester. \"At the moment, there are still a lot of unknowns about Andy Farrell, not least his medical situation. \"Whoever does take him on is going to take a big, big gamble.\" Farrell, who has had persistent knee problems, had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months. Leicester and Saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing Farrell if he decides to move to the 15-man game.\nIf he does move across to union, Wells believes he would better off playing in the backs, at least initially. \"I'm sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre,\" said Wells. \"I think England would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards. \"The jury is out on wether he can cross that divide. \"At this club, the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a ready-made replacement.\"",

Grease and line a 40cm by 28cm Swiss roll tin. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and caster sugar untill they are light and fluffy and three times the orignal volume. Add the warm water. Sift in 1/3 of the flour and gently fold in. Repeat untill all the flour has been added. Pour into the tin, level the top with a spatula and bake for 12-15 minutes, untill just comming away from the edges of the tin and springy to touch. Lay a piece of baking paper (bigger than the cake) on a worktop and sprinkle it evenly with caster sugar. Turn the Swiss roll out onto the baking paper gently and leave to cool for a few minutes. Peel away the baking paper it was baked in and cover with a slightly damp, clean tea towel (to prevent it from cracking as it dries). Make the filling. Melt the dark chocolate and 100ml of the double cream in a saucepan over a low heat. Allow to cool and then put it in the fridge to cool for a few minutes. Technically you should let it cool to room temperature before putting it in the fridge but I do not have the patience for this. Remove from the fridge and leave on the side untill ready to use. Meanwhile, in a bowl, whip the remaining 200ml of double cream untill soft peaks form. When the cake has cooled, remove the towel and spread the cake with the dark chocolate, then the cream and then sprinkle over the strawberries evenly. Using the baking paper to help you, gently roll the short side of the cake inwards. You want to roll it gently enough that it doesn't squidge out all the filling, but tight enough that it looks neat. Melt the 100g white chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionaly. When it is smooth, drizzle it over the Swiss roll. Make the custard. Break the 75g white chocolate up into pieces and add to any leftover melted white chocolate (from above). Heat the milk in a saucepan untill fairly hot but not boiling. You should be able to dip your finger in it without crying like a girl. If you have a thermometer, it should reach about 60°C (140°F). Remove from the heat. In a bowl, mix together the egg yolks and sugar, beating well. Pour in the hot milk and stir well, then return the mixture to the hot pan and cook over a low heat untill the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Pour the mixture into the bowl of white chocolate. Allow to stand for a minute, then stir well untill the white chocolate has melted and the custard is smooth.

Put 2 slabs of baby back ribs (about 3 pounds) on a baking sheet. Season the 2 slabs with salt, pepper, fresh thyme and some olive oil. Place them in the oven and bake. Low and slow - for 2 1/2 hours. As the ribs are baking, make the BBQ sauce. Start by wrapping 2 bacon slices around 1 bunch of fresh thyme and tie off with kitchen twine to make a nice bundle. I have found that if you don't have kitchen twine, the bacon will basically stay closed on its own, without being tied up. Pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the bacon and thyme bundle and cook for 3-4 minutes to render the bacon fat and give the sauce a nice smoky taste. Peel 1/2 onion and 2 garlic cloves and add to the pan. Cook for 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of ketchup,1 cup of peach preserves, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of molasses, 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon dry mustard, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon ground paprika and some freshly ground black pepper to saucepan. Give Sauce a stir and turn the heat down to low. Cook for 15-20 minutes to meld the flavors. Baste the ribs with the BBQ sauce and let them continue cooking, basting once every 15 minutes untill the 2 1/2 hour cooking time is finished. When the ribs are cooked, take them out of the oven. Cut the ribs straight through on an angle. Pick the onion and garlic out of the BBQ sauce and serve with the ribs.",
    "2 Tablespoons Butter\n1 cup Yellow Or Sweet Onion, Thinly Sliced\n2 slices Bacon\n8 ounces, weight Crimini Mushrooms, Sliced\n6 Eggs\n2 Tablespoons Milk\n1 cup Gruyere Cheese\n2 Tablespoons Parmesan Cheese (Optional)\nSalt And Pepper\n1. In an oven-proof skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add onions. Reduce heat to medium low and continue to cook untill onions soften and become an even light brown color (20-30 minutes). Remove onions to a plate. 2. Meanwhile, in another skillet fry bacon over medium heat untill crisp. Remove bacon from the pan (leave the drippings) and allow bacon to cool, then crumble it. In the same skillet, add mushrooms and cook over medium heat untill soft. Sprinkle salt over mushrooms. Remove from heat. 3. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and a dash of salt and pepper. Add mushrooms, onions, bacon, and 1/2 cup Gruyere. Stir to combine. 4. Pour egg mixture into the same skillet used to saute the onions. (You should have enough butter left in there to keep everything from sticking. If not, add more.) Cook over medium heat untill eggs are partially set. The outside should look cooked with bits of uncooked egg throughout the middle. 5. Turn on the broiler of your oven. Sprinkle egg with remaining Gruyere then place skillet under the broiler. Broil for 2-3 minutes or untill egg is fully cooked and cheese is slightly browned and bubbly. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese if desired.",
    "FOR THE PASTRY:\n1-1/4 cup All-purpose Flour\n3/4 cups Whole Wheat Pastry Flour\n1 teaspoon Salt\n1/4 cups Shortening\n1/2 cups Cold Butter Cubed\n4 Tablespoons Ice Water\n1 whole Egg, Lightly Beaten For Egg Wash\nFOR THE FILLING:\n6 cups Peeled, Cored, And Diced Apples\n2 Tablespoons Fresh Lemon Juice\n1/2 cups Sugar\n3 Tablespoons Flour\n1 teaspoon Cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoons Nutmeg\n1/8 teaspoons Salt\n2/3 cups Packed Brown Sugar\n2 Tablespoons Butter, Cubed\nFor the pastry: In a large bowl, whisk together both flours and salt. Using a pastry cutter, mix in the shortening and the butter. You want to keep mixing untill the dough resembles peas and cornmeal. Add iced water 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with a fork, untill the dough comes together. You want the dough to start pulling together well, but not be at all wet. (Note: You want the dough to come together with the least amount of water possible to ensure that it is flaky. You should also try to handle it quickly and gently so as not to melt all the butter.) Work it into a ball, cut the ball in half, work each half into a disk and then wrap it it wax paper or plastic wrap. Let the disk rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. For the filling: Peel, core and dice your apples (1\" dice or smaller is best). Add the diced apples to a bowl waiting with the lemon juice. Swish them around with every addition of apple. In a small bowl, mix all the dry ingredients except the brown sugar. Pour the flour mixture over the apples and mix well. Melt butter in a large Dutch oven or deep pot. Add the apple mixture and then pour over the brown sugar and mix it in. Cover the pot and let it simmer, on medium low, untill the apples are cooked through (about 20 minutes for me). Stir often so as not to burn the sugars. If your chunks are too big, break the whole mixture up a bit with an immersion blender. Large apple pieces tend to break the top pie crust. For the final assembly: Preheat the oven to 375°F. Roll the dough out between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Use a 2\" cookie cutter to cut the bottom of the pie bites. I used a 2 1/2\" cookie cutter to cut the top. I found it was easier than trying to stretch the 2\" but you can use either. Lay the circles on a baking sheet lined with parchment. (Note: I found the dough would get too warm to deal with quickly, so I would cut 12 or so circles and set them on the tray, then put the dough in the freezer for 10 minutes before trying to release the circles. I got 24 circles from each ball of dough, cutting 12 and then re-rolling.) Fill each circle with 1 teaspoon of filling. Spread egg wash around the outside rim, them top with the larger circle. Use a fork to crimp the sides and seal the pies. Cover with the egg wash and poke a couple of vent holes in each pie. If you are not sending them to a school that cares about sugar, dust the top of each pie with some sugar in the raw or other large crystal sugar. Bake the pies for 15-20 minutes looking for them to be golden brown. Let them cool for 5 minutes on the tray, then transfer them to a cooling rack.",
    "FOR THE CRUST:\n1 cup Graham Crumbs\n3 Tablespoons Sugar\n1/4 cups Butter\nFOR THE FILLING:\n8 ounces, weight Cream Cheese\n9 ounces, weight Sugar\n1-1/2 ounce, weight Cornstarch\n12 ounces, weight Goat Cheese\n5 ounces, weight Sour Cream\n3/4 teaspoons Cinnamon\n3/4 teaspoons Ginger\n1/4 teaspoons Nutmeg\n1/4 teaspoons Cloves\n8 ounces, weight Pumpkin Puree\n4 Eggs\n1 Egg Yolk\nPreheat oven to 350°F (176°C). Put graham crumbs and sugar in a medium bowl. Microwave butter for 30 seconds. Pour melted butter over graham mixture and mix well. Spray a springform pan with baking spray. Pour graham crumbs inside and press well to form an even layer of graham crumbs on the bottom only (not up the sides). Bake graham crumbs for 10 minutes. Once graham crumbs are out, turn oven down to 250°F (121°C). Add a cake pan with water filled halfway up to the oven, so it can start steaming while you're getting the cheesecake batter ready. Fit the mixing bowl with a paddle attachment and paddle the cream cheese and sugar together on low speed. Add corn starch. Scrape down sides. Let this go for 2 minutes. Add goat cheese and sour cream. Scrape down sides. Let this go for another 2 minutes. Add all the spices, then add pumpkin puree. Scrape down sides, and let this go for another 2 minutes. Lastly, add eggs and yolk, one at a time, untill thoroughly combined. Pour batter into prepared springform pan. Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes with no fan (not convection). The cheesecake is done with it all jiggles together. It should not appear soupy in the middle. Best way to serve this is to completely cool for 5 hours or overnight first, then take a realy hot knife to make clean cuts.",

    "FOR THE SALAD:\n1 Egg\n1/2 Tomato On The Vine, Sliced\n1 Green Onion, Chopped\n2 cups Raw Spinach\nFOR THE DRESSING:\n1 Tablespoon Olive Oil\n1 Tablespoon Red Wine Vinegar\n1 teaspoon Dijon Mustard\n1 teaspoon Freshly Squeezed Lemon Juice\n1 pinch Salt\n1 pinch Freshly Ground Pepper\n1 teaspoon Red Pepper Flakes\nFor a medium rare egg (see note): Place the egg in a small pot and add water untill it reaches just about 1/4 inch over the egg so it is completely submerged. Place the pot on the stove and heat over high heat untill the water comes to a rolling boil. Once it reaches a rolling boil, turn the heat all the way down to low and allow the egg to simmer for exactly 4 minutes. Imediately place the egg in ice cold water (by \"shocking\" the egg, it will prevent the inside of the egg from continuing to cook). Allow egg to cool. Peel the shell off. For the salad: Slice the egg in half and place with the sliced tomatos and chopped green onion on the bed of spinach For the salad dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Drizzle dressing over the salad and serve imediately. Notes: 1. If you do not like the inside of the egg to be at all runny, follow the directions above but leave the egg to simmer for 12 minutes instead of the 4 minutes listed. 2. This recipe is 231 calories less than Panera Bread's Spinach Power Salad. It is a much healthier alternative with no compromise to flavor or portion.",

    "3 tablespoons oil\n6 onions, sliced thin\n4 cups vegetable broth\n4 cups potatos, cut into bite sized chunks\nHeat the oil in a pressure cooker (without lid) over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for quite a long time to caramelize. The exact timing will depend on how sweet your onions are. Mine weren't sweet at all so the process took about 40 minutes. The way to caramelize is to cook the onions slowly over medium heat - perhaps adding a bit of veggie broth if they start to stick to the pan. You're looking for a nice deep brown color both on the onions and on the pan- that's the sugar comming out of the onion. After the onions are nice and brown and the bottom of the pan is looking very brown add the potatos. Stir and cook for about 5 minutes - to give the potatos a bit of that nice roasted flavor. Cover with the veggie broth. Raise the heat to high and lock on the pressure cooker lid. Bring to high pressure, then imediately turn off the heat. Allow the pressure to reduce naturally. Remove lid. Using an immersion blender, blend the soup thoroughly. Serve imediately - maybe with some nice crusty bread.",

Trust me, they will turn out delicious pretty much any way you wanna rock this recipe. Change up the bread, use milk or cream, there's no way you'll get this one wrong. Onwards ho! Crack the egg into a bowl, add the salt and whisk with a fork. Add as much or as little milk as you like to the egg and salt, whisk again untill well combined. I usually add about 1 1/2 cups (if I have them) but it's entirely up to you. All you need to remember is: more milk = soggier inside of the toast. Heat up a pan and let a pat of butter melt in it untill it sizzles slightly. Dip the bread (pieces, halves, quarters, everything works except using a whole roll as is) into the milk and egg mix. Depending on the bread you use, it will absorb the liquid quickly or slowly. Be aware of that when you consider the time you want to leave it in the mix. Place the dipped bread into the pan. Sprinkle with sugar. Turn the bread around and sprinkle with sugar again. Turn the bread again about two or three times or untill golden brown. If you like a lot of caramelized sugar on your French toast, keep sprinkling with sugar before each turn. Repeat untill you've done all the bread you wanted. Put on plate and dust with cinnamon. Voila! Tip#1: if you don't like cinnamon or just want more along with it, you can use whatever floats your boat in the area of French toast. Maple syrup, fruit syrup, fresh fruit, ice cream, yoghurt ... literally anything goes! Tip#2: this recipe is ideal if you have bread that is about to go stale. Just let it soak a little longer in the liquid before putting in the pan, works like a charm!",
    "3 pounds (more Or Less) Unpeeled Shrimp (21-26 Count Or Larger)\n1/2 cups Olive Oil\nSalt And Pepper, to taste\n3 whole Lemons (juice Of)\n1/4 cups (to 1/2 Cup) Worcestershire Sauce\nTabasco\n1 stick Butter\nFirst, thoroughly rinse raw shrimp w/shells still on. I use 21-26 count (that means 21-26 shrimp per pound) but Ive certainly used bigger. Any smaller than this, and its difficult to peel, so stick with 21-26 or bigger. Place the shrimp in a large baking pan in a single layer. Over top of the shrimp drizzle about 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil. Generously sprinkle black pepper over top of the shrimp. Be very generous! Now sprinkle generously with salt (I use kosher). Squeeze the juice of about 3-4 lemons over top of all of the shrimp. Now GENEROUSLY drizzle Worcestershire all over the shrimp, about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup. Drizzle Tabasco sauce over the top to your desired temperature. Some like it hot. Now grab your stick of butter and cut it into pats. Place the pats of butter on top of the shrimp as evenly spaced as possible. Place the pan of shrimp under the broiler in your oven for just about 10 minutes untill the shrimp are no longer translucent. Serve with a roll of crusty French bread becasue you need something to absorb all of the glorious juices.",

Shake vigorously for at least 1 minute. Test, and if the curd is too flat, charge it with a second charger, shaking vigorously for another minute. Refrigerate untill youre ready to serve dessert. Put the egg white and a pinch of cream of tartar in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk. Turn it on to low, and whisk the white gently for 2 minutes, to start establishing a structure. The white will look frothy but still a bit wet. Turn the speed up to medium and add 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Continue to beat at medium speed untill the white has body and is just shy of having soft peaks. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and continue beating untill the white is glossy and smooth and allmost stiff. Beat in the rose water. Bring a saucepan of water to a simmer. Drop heaping teaspoons of the meringue into the water and simmer gently untill cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. The meringues will double in size. Remove with a slotted spoon.

In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar, honey, orange zest, 1/4 cup orange juice, pumpkin pie spice, and nutmeg. Season with salt. Roll out enough aluminum foil to surround the ham and place the ham in the center of the foil. Peel back the layers of the ham and place a sprig of thyme between every other layer of the spirals. Pour half of the glaze over the ham allowing it to sink into the slices. Tightly wrap the ham in the foil and place on a rack in a roasting pan. Fill the pan with an inch of water and roast in the oven untill the internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F, about 20 minutes per pound. Pour the remaining half of the glaze in a small saucepot on medium heat and bring to a simmer. Whisk untill small bubbles appear all over, then turn off the heat. The glaze will thicken as it rests. Raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Remove the ham from the oven. Using caution and tongs to help, peel back the aluminum foil from the top, leaving the aluminum foil on the sides and underneath the ham to catch the glaze and juices. Slather the remaining glaze all over the top of the ham and place back in the oven uncovered for 15 more minutes. Remove and let rest before slicing.",
    "1 lb spinach\n1 tablespoon butter, to wilt spinach in\n6 slices bacon\n12 onion, diced\n12 eggs\n12 teaspoon salt\n14 teaspoon cayenne\n12 teaspoon pepper\nCook the spinach briefly - heat a large stock pot to high heat and add all your spinach plus a pat of butter to grease the bottom, and the spinach should wilt in about a minute. Cook only untill just wilted. Drain the spinach and then actually squeeze it dry to get all excess water out. Then chop the spinach. Whisk together 12 eggs with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Set aside. Mince 6 strips of bacon, then fry in frying pan over medium heat untill just about crisp. Drain off excess grease. Add in onions and cook untill they are just starting to get soft. Add in spinach, then egg mixture, to the frying pan. Mix the eggs into the spinach so that the spinach is distributed evenly through the egg. Sprinkle 3 oz of feta over the top of the skillet. If you'd like, gently touch the feta with the tip of your spoon so that it goes slightly into the egg mixture, while still remaining on top. Bake at 350 degrees for approx 10 minutes You want the eggs to still look a little bit wet and soft in the middle. For me, 10 minutes was slightly too long. The next step is to put the eggs under the broiler for a minute or two, to let it get slightly golden brown at the top. The eggs will continue to cook from the heat in the pan even after you remove from the heat, so it is better to undercook and to allow the eggs to continue to set even after removed from the oven.",

Add the rest of the ingredients, except the glaze, and mix with vigour to ensure everything is spread evenly through the dough - this will be very sticky! Knead the dough on a clean work surface for between 5-10 minutes You can dip hands into a bowl of water at intervals to help with the kneading if neccessary. Press the dough mixture intpo a well greased 2lb loaf tin. Make sure it's pushed right into the corners. Bake the loaf on the middle shelf for about 35 mins untill a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. When you have removed it from the oven, brush with glaze and return to oven for a couple of minutes to set the glaze. Let the bread stand in the tin for a few minutes, then invert onto a wire rack. This keeps very well and becuase it's made using rye it can be better for being left a couple of days before eating. (We never let it wait long though !).",

Mix with a hand mixer without stopping untill the mixture is thick in texture and lighter in color and begins to form a foam on the surface. Remove from the heat, transfer to a mixing bowl and add the halvah. Mix at a high speed without stopping for 15 minutes and then fold in the whipped cream, mixing gently with a plastic spatula untill the mixture is even throughout. Transfer the mixture to a loaf pan, cover with plastic wrap or parchment paper and place in the freezer for a minimum of 6-8 hours. Serve in thick slices as a dessert. *Hailing from the Middle East, this confection is made from ground sesame seed and honey, sometimes with the addition of chopped dried fruit and pistachio nuts. It`s available in most supermarkets in wrapped bars, and in Jewish delicatessens in long slabs from which individual slices can be cut.",

Mean while, toast the walnuts in a dry 10-inch skillet over medium heat untill fragrant, about 8-10 minutes. Watch closely so they dont burn. In a mini food processor, combine the sun-dried tomatos, toasted walnuts, basil, Parmesan cheese, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and black pepper. Process untill thick and paste-like. Add more olive oil if it is too dry and crumbly. Drop in the pasta and cook as directed on the package, usually 8-10 minutes on average. Reheat the pan you toasted the walnuts in over medium heat and add in the sun-dried tomato/walnut pesto. Stir often while the pesto starts to caramelize on the bottom of the pan. De-glaze the pan with a good splash of white wine. Use as much or as little as you would like. Stir and scrape up the bits on the bottom of the pan. Turn the heat off and, using tongs, add in the spaghetti noodles straight from the pot. Add a 1/4 cup of reserved pasta water and toss some more. Season with salt to taste.

    "1 cup Milk\n2 bags Chai Tea Bags, Individual Size Tea Bags\n3 cups Flour\n1 teaspoon Salt\n1 cup Sugar\n5 teaspoons Baking Powder\n1-1/2 stick Butter, Cold\n2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract\n1. Preheat oven 350 degrees F. 2. Add milk to a sauce pan to warm over low heat. Remove from heat and add tea bags and steep for 10-15 minutes to get the full flavor of the chai. 3. Combine flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl. 4. Cut cold butter into the flour mixture untill it looks like crumbs. I always just use my hands for this part. 5. After the tea steeped milk has cooled, add to the flour and butter. Add the vanilla. Stir together untill combined. 6. Turn mixture out onto a clean surface. The dough will be a little crumbly. 7. Using your hands, push everything together. Do not knead or handle the dough too much. 8. With a rolling pin, gently roll out the dough to 3/4-inch thick. 9. From this point, you can cut the dough into triangles. I like to use a square cookie cutter, then cut the square on the diagonal. Now you have two perfect triangles. Easy, right? 10. Now transfer scones to a baking pan lined with parchment paper and bake for 15-20 minutes, just untill the edges turn brown.",

I also smoke pot. but have cut back that as well. it also runs in my family my mom is a alcoholic as she drinks a box of wine in about a week. I should also note i suffer from Asperger's, anxiety, depression and possibly bi-polar. I'm a complete wreck and cant function with out alcohol. but has affected my health as of now. since lockdown, my life and anxiety got worse and my drinking went up to at least a 6 pack a night. and about 3 joints at least. but the past 9 months of that has seriously affected my health. I gained 25 pounds and now am suffering from liver and heart problems. i tried stopping 5 times before. and even quitting smoking was way easier. i don't know what to do. i have no friends and no support network. if i keep drinking the rest of the year i will be dead.

    "So my girlfriend left to Kansas on a trip with her son. We have a history of slightly not trusting each other so we turned our location. I’m in Washington state and work night shift so I sleep through out the day. I wake up check her location and she’s at the lake. I text her Goodmorning but she doesn’t reply. I figured she was with her son since he enjoys fishing. I check her location again 2 hours later and she’s at the bar, I start thinking ok she’s probably with one of her girl friends. I text her “hey beatiful how’s it going?” She doesn’t reply. An hour later she text me with the focus on her son misbehaving. Long story short I eventually find out she spent the whole day with her guy freind. Watched the sunset by the lake and went for pizza beer and pool later on. Is this bad or does this just seem bad? Do I have the right to be slightly jealous? When I asked her about her guy freind she started to get defensive. Does this mean there’s possibly more to the story then just hanging out? When I asked her about what they talked about, she couldn’t realy respond. Am I just overthinking this?",

If I've recently browsed Reddit, hitting the back button will take me to a previous page I viewed and it will keep going alllll the way back through all the pages untill hitting the Home page and only then it will return me to my previous app. This is very bizarre, and maybe difficult to explain; this never happens with any other app, only Reddit. I've never seen anyone mention it, is there a way to fix it? It's happened across different phones, as well, so it's definately a Reddit problem. It's annoying. I'd prefer to open links in the browser version but can't becasue of stupid google AMP and now the app has this problem too...",
    "So I’m trying to get the volcanic stone drake and I’ve already done all of the achievements except for the one in the title. It’s actually driving me insane becuase today is the third day I’ve tried it and I can’t get it to work. I’m doing it solo and it’s not the usual problem where people can’t get 5 in a row to spawn but instead I’m just killing the boss. I don’t one shot it as I have all of my gear and weapon away so I’m just punching. I get 5 of the things to spawn, I punch the boss and do around 70% damage to his health. So the first 5 is simple but the second 5 I kill him. Is there a way to do a lot less damage or at least less than 50%? I tried punching and the second time using the toy foam sword but it doesn’t work it just says: “can’t do that here”. Any solutions?",
    "A new episode of a Netflix or Disney+ show will come out and 3-4 days later Reddit will be full of unmarked spoilers and when someone calls it out in the comments there’s hordes of people who will come to defend the OP, most commonly by saying “it’s already been 3 days you should have watched it by now”. This is SO stupid. 3 days is not that long after the episode aired at all, and people can have plenty of valid reasons to not watch it in that time, for example wanting to wait untill the whole season is out or simply not having the time. I wouldn’t even mind that much but it is literally so easy to mark your post as a spoiler. I do not understand why people feel like they have to so strongly defend spoilers when it is so easy to mark something as a spoiler, like why are you defending something for not doing something that is so easy to do and you should have the common decency to do?",

    "Had a order tonight at McDonald's. The order wasn't ready so I decided to wait a good 10-15 minutes to see if the order would be ready then. I kept updating the customer and told them id be there asap. Even though they sounded pleased with me updating them, I wasnt going to rely on MAYBE receiving a bigger tip from them. The dasher before me had a big order that was 3 large bags and drinks. At the same time, 2-3 people entered, ordered/picked up their food and left. They had more food than what I was picking up for the customer. At the same time the guy behind the counter asked for my order ID again. Overall I wasted around 30 minutes waiting for the dam order. I decided to unassign the order and headed for the exit. The guy behind the counter asks, \"Did they cancel the order?\" I didn't even respond and proceeded to walk out. Right after I decided to end with one last order on my way home. These McDonald's orders and workers are starting to get worse. They like taking their sweet time. Sometimes I think they want the dashers to be late after repeatedly seeing the same dasher throughout the week. They probably feel like they aren't getting paid enough while they know dashers are making more than them.",
    "This is not a comment on the teams or any of the players but more the organising of these matches. As a european fan I would like to actually watch my region play yet I can't. As a G2 esports fan, I can't ever watch my favourite team as there is no stream of any of the games? Seems like a wierd decision to make if you want your esport to grow. Furthermore, I am confused as to how the official valorant esports website works. Literally none of the matches played outside of brazil are listed on the website. I can't even see the standings or match schedule for any region. Just for a bit of context on this one, I am currently watching a korean qualifier THAT ISN'T EVEN LISTED AS EXISTING ON THEIR WEBSITE BUT IS BEING STREAMED FROM THE OFFICIAL VALORANT TWITCH ACCOUNT. I am confused as to how they expect their esport to grow if they put no effort into their official match schedule, or standings for anything other than masters. Pretty disappointed with this as I am an avid fan of esports and valorant I want to see this area grow.",

I realy enjoyed this movie, and I'd never consumed any Star Trek material previously. I very much like this attitude towards space as a final frontier: something to be explored. I would have liked to see a little more exploration and intrigue, but I suppose movies need dire/somewhat immediate threats. I'd love to continue to experiance this universe, but I'm not totally sure where to go next, as there's so much out there. Should I watch a newer series like Star Trek: Discovery? Should I go farther back and watch some of the older series? I'm curious as to where you all think a new fan should start.",
    "Always learn something new. In the rest of the world most Holmes stories are public domain but not here.  Finnish copyright legislation is difficult to understand and vague, leaving much room for interpretation. According to a looser interpretation, all Doyle’s works are in the public domain as more than seventy years have passed since the author’s death. But according to a stricter interpretation, Doyle’s books are still under copyright protection becasue these are still published and printed by modern publisher meaning that only the \"dead works\" are free from copyrights. The current trend, which is intended to garantee a secure livelihood for writers, favors, above all, a stricter interpretation, and this protection remains as long as these books are republished. So for this reason, Holmes' books are not the PD in Finland, even though ninety and allmost one years have passed since Doyle's death. And it's wierd.",

Sure, they can be stupid, arrogant, stereotypical and  bad with technology. But this is present in every generation, not just them. We should value their experiance and contribution. We should listen to their stories and advice, not necessarily take it, but listen. You can't devalue someone becuase they're old and need help to understand. My own grandparents have shitty opinions and think in a very old fashion manner, I'll argue with them and try to change their view, but not  call them out for not thinking like me.

They dress to look good all the time play life’s game if you will and don’t question life at all and all the absurdity’s. Is it some kind of herd mentality? I feel like I’ve drifted so far from the herd I’ve had to derive my own kind of meaning for life and it feels very detached from “society” views. I look at everyone and wonder how they are all so content sitting in traffic every single day and working jobs they hate without questioning anything and all I can put it down to is they all have “people” around them that makes the suffering bearable. But if you have no one everything seems “clearer” in a sense and you realise how pointless most tasks are.

    "Putting the food in the oven the second you turn it on saves you time and is much less annoying. If I preheat the oven and sit down, I have to get up 10 minutes later to put the food in. Then, I have to get up once the food is done. Let's say that pizza rolls need to cook for 20 minutes on 400° F. It takes an oven 12 minutes to preheat. That's 32 minutes for pizza rolls. Sure, microwaves are much faster, but microwaving pizza is sinful. If I put the pizza rolls in the oven and THEN turn the oven on, I can put them in for 24 minutes and have them done 8 minutes faster. Baking burgers at 350° F for 30 minutes? How about putting the burgers in the second you turn on the oven and take them out in 25? It realy adds up the more you cook.",

Like when I meet with friends, yes it can be nice and all but I feel like all the talking and activities we might do are not in fact that grat and just a mean to kill time, and I prefer to kill time alone cause that way at least I'm free to do whatever I want in contrary when I am engaged with other people. I don't know if that's healthy or not, I just wanted to ask if anybody else feels the same.",
    "I think James knows deep down inside he's an amature film maker at best so it's no secret that any time he's been offered something like a cameo appearance in a movie or has said he wouldn't have time to film a motion picture movie it's becasue deep down inside he knows he's only best at making youtube videos. But he would always say he had big ambitions for what he wanted to do outside of Cinemassacre but always stop short by saying he has no time for it. Even though he did the AVGN movie I think he would've at least tried to film it with kids in his life becasue he set out to do the movie with the intent of getting big exposure from already being famous from AVGN. It explains why since then he's made excuses of not having time due to kids becuase he won't admit he was full of shit all along about being able to progress to much bigger projects than anything involving Cinemassacre. Also he could be shy about getting big time recognition from being a film maker so that's where the excuses come from in my opinion.",
    "So I just finished reading the dysphoria Bible last night as was recommended literature to read, and well f@$k. I went from being at like an 85% to  a 99.7% sure that I am truly a trans woman. And I just feel like I got hit with a wave of good, bad, and everything in-between. Is there such thing as comming out to yourself before you can truly accept it? becasue I feel like that what I just did. And now I'm just sitting here like overwhelmed with thousands of different emotions to the point I allmost feel numb to it all and I just can't fathom the next step. Is it just me or is this shit scary and just alot all to start taking in. Idk I feel like thst was a big anxiety filled ramble but thats the best I could at putting words out of my head.

    "Hey all, arizona state here.  Currently in the process of getting a team started here for next year, and had a question about officer/leadership structure.  I know every team does it differently and the motto is whatever works, works, but I realy just don't know how to divide this up, or what positions and duties are needed exactly.  Aside from subteam leads, of course, those are pretty obvious. I'm talking more about outside of that.  I read in michael S's blog post about KU's early days and they had like a program director, operations director and some other stuff but the duties of each weren't realy mentioned. Any insight on this? Also about picking other officers, we have a group of about 20 interested students right now, and i'm thinking about just sending out a google form asking for everyone's experiance and choosing based on who's most qualified.  Does that sound like a sound approach? Any input greatly appreciated",
    "So I’ve been working with my now 11 month old pup on having calmer walks. He used to throw tantrums/get zoomies all the time and we’ve gotten to a point where that’s happening less and less. However, I’m still actively training him on walks to essentially remain calm. Still having to throw some kibble down and have him find it if I feel like he’s over threshold. Still having to feed him his dinner via walks in order to attempt loose leash walks and have him look at me when I ask. I’m wondering from people who’ve experienced something similer how long it took for your dog to have calmer walks and when you stopped needing to treat all the time or if you stopped at all. I understand that age is a big factor here and he’s got a lot of energy so when we go on walks, which is already the most exciting thing for him, he’s a lot harder to have remain completely calm. Some walks he’ll walk super nice for me and that’s usually after his energy’s been drained. Some walks he won’t even respond to my commands and that’s when I know he’s over threshold.",
    "Hello. So just like a lot of other people, I'm having some issues with the Spotify app on my Xbox one. Every time I try and open it, it'll act like it's going to boot up normally for maybe 15 seconds before crashing and sending me back to my home screen. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, I've tried connecting to the app from my phone, I've tried just about everything the internet recommended. Contacting Spotify support did no good, as they were very insistent that it was my Xbox and not them, even though nearly every single review on the Microsoft store is negative due to numerous claims of crashing or just not opening up. Is there any solution for this issue, or is the app just broken with no sign of repair in sight?",
    "So in the last update they added hero xp for relic milestones / progress. Is this bonus xp actually noticable or just a fake feature? Also is it retroactive? Might actually resub for that, if so... And about the treasures / dota+ exclusive sets, is there any chance they will ever add some actually cool ones? Are there new dota+ seasonal treasures every year or do the simply cycle back? Haven't gotten a single one yet, allmost all the sets are so lame. I don't know why they don't add some high quality sets / items maybe even arcana level but for an absurd amount of shards? This way you can't buy them from other players but have to buy dota+ for months and maybe it wouldn't make the subscription feel like such a waste.",

    "i have a nostril piercing i got done in late august which got infected becasue i was allergic to the nickel in the ring. i then got a hypoallergenic titanium but started to notice the same sort of issue and figured i just didn’t do well with metal, so i’ve tried using a plastic bioflex ring, but the same thing started happening again when i started using saltwater with my new septum piercing. what happens is that a ball of pus forms on the inside of my nose around the piercing, and it gets quite uncomfortable, but it doesn’t seem to be rejecting or anything. the place i got it pierced said to use antibacterial soap on it, but it doesn’t realy seem to be helping. what should i do? should i switch back to the hypoallergenic ring and use a salt soak for both of them? i’m unsure of what to do at this point and i realy don’t want to have to get rid of it.",
    "So I recently broke up with my significant other over a year ago after a 7 year relationship. She was my first gf in all aspects yes even my first kiss. And we went though a lot together, like i stopped her father from rapping her, or her freind from molesting her in our earlier years of our relationship. Hell last year we got an apartment together so we could spend more time together, eventually  i helped her a job at my work, help her buy a car and even got her into the college she wanted to by pulling some strings. Sure we had our fights but we worked them out...or so i had thought. After deciding on what house to buy and possibly names for kids. The next morning she said to me she wanted to break up i was confused and said may i know why ? She just said she wanted to and i said thats a bit vague but she nevergavea reply back to.  We agreed that we should and we did but shortly afterward i came home one night from work and she said she was dating some guy less then 24 hrs of breaking up. I understand once you break up with someone its not cheating  but I felt so much pain that I still don't fully understand. To make matters worse i had lost my job in the same day. Now i am skipping over more painful parts like how she took the rest of my money saying she would go buy groceries and instead spent it all on her new lover. But thats not why im writting this post. In truth I want to know what I still feel depressed over it ? Like why do I still remember her smile or other things ? Which just makes me feel realy lonely and i never experienced anything like this before.",
    "They told me someone of my income should be spending more per month than I was and they wouldn’t approve the refinance without me increasing my expenses declaration. I said I was frugal and that’s why I own a house as a single young female on an average wage and have good savings. The lending specialist said I need to revisit my expenses, for example I left personal grooming empty, what about hair cuts? I said I haven’t had one in two years, I’m growing it out and trim the ends myself. She said what about internet? I said yeah I hotspot my phone that I only pay $28 a month for, no monthly home internet account. It was very strange. I feel like I just got shamed for saving my money? This is a bit of a vent I guess, just was a very bizarre situation. Is this... normal?

    "I had a kinda stressful experiance a few nights ago. I was trying to sleep and I was pretty drunk, took benadryl, and had work in 6 hours so I was stressed lol. I woke up like 2 hours into my sleep probably from anxiety. I tried falling back asleep but I heard voices in my head as I was nodding off. They sounded like my friends and they were talking about Lil Nas X's music video lol, but basically I kept on waking up and nodding off but then hearing it again and I think this was due to a lot of anxiety. They weren't like in my room and I knew they were in my head. I turned off my fan and once I heard my roommate snoring I realized that my hallucinations may have been caused by that and the fan and I was able to fall asleep realy quickly. I do have sleep problems, I had sleep paralysis like a few days ago so I'm guessing it's related to that + the drunkness. I have health OCD too so I keep thinking about it.",

    "The car has 700hp so it has the potential to go realy fast but the problem is that the car only has 4 gears with a 2000 rpm redline. A clutch that if you give it too much push it will stall and if you don't let it out enough it will stall so the only way to start it is to be perfect. If you manage to do that you also have to deal with the breaks that only work less than half the time so you either end up pushing the car way too hard or you drive like a snail. Even if you make everything work perfectly you still only can run in 3rd gear going about 20 mph becuase if you push it any harder the engine will give out becuase your car is equipped with a shitty transmission and cant shift properly.",

He died at 83 years oldAll I saw were pamphlets and envelopes for more information pertaining to Bosley Hair Club for men. A lot of them and yet he never acted on them over the years. And I could tell that while he was here his bald appearance realy bothered  him front the amount of all of the Bosley stuff I found which was extensive. What it told me was DO anything you have to while you are here to feel better about YOURSELF. You don't owe or have justify why you are doing it to anyone. This is about your self esteem and confidence not about THEM. Becasue life is short and it goes by in an eyeblink.

    "I've often wondered if there is a far greater purpose at play with the character of Rocks, I can't see Oda as having created the character only for him to be used as a 5 second backstory for some of the Yonko/Garp. I feel as though in the future we may see the character return. Perhaps he merely faked his own death at God Valley in order to acheive his ambition of becomeing king of the world in secret? It just seems a bit sus that 50 chapters after we are shown this mysterious new character of Imu, that we should see the character of Rocks D Xebec be revealed as well. If he is powerful enough to have an entire boat full of Yonko follow him, then I would say it's definately possible for him to have beaten the Gorosei into submission. Perhaps before Xebec became the king of the world the 5 elders actually did rule reasonably and were corrupted by Xebec into more and more distasteful acts?",
    "I applied for EIDL loan in April 2020 using the short form most likely. I used videos on YouTube to help guide me on how to apply. I received a grant for 1k and loan for about 10k. Now that I am waiting on the review for the targeted advanced grant, I realized I may have entered incorrect numbers. I closed my old buisness and opened a new one. Rather than change the name I started all over. This was around September/October of 2019. Once I fully transitioned I had maybe two months of income reported in my profit and loss. For the PPP and everything I used the correct data. I thought I did the same for EIDL. Looking at the forms I was supposed to put in gross revenues for before January 2020 and something makes me think I put in expected for 2020 and that is why I got a loan for 10k. I am worried I will be denied for the targeted grant and thats one of the reasons why its taking so long. The IRS has yet to process my 2019 Tax returns.  If I send in my 2020 tax return will that help? Should I fix it while it is in review? Is there a way to get a copy of the application so I can check?",

Wouldn't he be the perfect example for using the 103 thousand grimoires in a perfect way without damage? it is enough for him to make a clone use it, or use it himself, since damage doesn't realy matter in your case, the biggest question would be how to get them, hijacking Index would be extremely tedious and something repetitive in the series, besides that it wouldn't last long, for to be something permanent in Kakine's arsenal would need to have another form, maybe using his dark matter he could copy from the index mind all of them, after all dark matter has strange abilities, like when he replied the sisters and etc, his power is far beyond the sense so reading memories shouldn't be surprising.",
    "I’m 17 and 6 foot. I’ve had stretch marks since I was around 14 becuase of a massive growthspurt. I was already a chunky kid so it wasn’t hard to get them. They used to only be on my hips and a few on my stomach. Over time, I’ve shifted weight a lot. This time last year I weighed about 170- this year I weighed 250. Massive weight gain, I blame covid. Anyway, I’ve started losing weight again and rapidly. But now I’m struggling becuase I’m insecure about the hefty amount of stretch marks I’ve gained this past year. I have stretch marks head to toe. My shoulders, my forearms, my armpits, a few baby ones underneath my chest , all across my stomach, some across my back, across my butt, and on the front and backs of my knees. I’m at a place where i love myself but the amount of stretch marks I’ve gotten realy make me question if anybody will ever find me appealing. I’ve yet to show anybody becasue they’re a sensitive topic to me , but I just wanna know - are they something I should let control my life the way I do? I know they’ll fade eventually and all that, but right now that they’re new and fresh, it’s a bit of a confidence punch to see the red/purple scars all across my body, especially my stomach.

    "Ever wondered what it would be like to see Tom Cruise taking a break from his usual Sci-Fi & Impossible series \"avatar\". Well, here is your answer - It gets even more exciting and entertaining. This is Tom Cruise's real life take on the impossible series where Barry Seal replaces Ethan Hunt and CIA as the agency, which dictates the terms. It's just that Barry loves to go with the flow and without any intention of getting involved with anything that seems out of his league and this is something each one of us can relate to. He is your usual guy who happens to be a pilot and wants to make some extra cash with every extra mile. So what's wrong with it? Well nothing is wrong when you do it for the right guys, and nothing gets more exciting and dangerous when those right guys turn out to be CIA.<br/><br/>What is even more amusing and entertaining to watch is the fact that despite having no choice left but to cooperate with CIA, \"Barry Seal never says no\" to any offer (even if it comes from any drug lord) that helps him maintain his cash flow that obviously was becomeing unmanageable for him by every passing day. Although, I must admit that it was quite a fun to watch him trying to manage millions of cash that he had no idea how to spend. <br/><br/>You will definatly enjoy watching Tom cruise as Barry Seal who uses CIA to get his end of the bargain (and they thought that they were the only smart guys who live in one of the greatest countries of the world).<br/><br/>If you want to go on an adventure trip, go watch this movie and you will understand what Tom Cruise realy means when he says, \"I am just a gringo who always delivers\".",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me becuase my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos realy went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caugt with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am gratefull for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "How many times do I need to read other's reviews on disaster films before I remember most people on here writting these think they are actual film critics? It is a disaster movie. Yes, the science is terrible. Yes the coincidences are fantastical. If you watch these for ground breaking stories with rich plots, or for an Oscar worthy performance by one of the actors, then you are watching these for the wrong damn reasons.\nThis movie shows a future where due to the rise in global temperatures, a modern ice age is triggered. How it is ushered in is by these violent, giant hurricane-like storms that cause flash freezing, and bring in a myriad of disasters with them. These include tsunamis and blizzards that drop so many feet of snow that people are walking level with the signs on the interstate that you would normally drive under. It also tries to throw in a lot of relatable human elements, such as the struggle of a man that is an absentee parent becuase of his job, trying to connect with his son, a lonely boy dying of cancer, and just the human death that this kind of disaster would bring.\nDo not watch this for the science, though I do feel that they had the causation of another ice age correct. Do not watch this for deep plot. Watch this for the enjoyable ride on which it takes you.",
    "Went to an advance screening expecting your usual \"shy kid in high school learns to stick up for himself\" sort of feel-good drama. This movie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the mature themes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the Q+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional aspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I realy cared about these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their story never felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see this movie!",
    "\"I used to think this was the begining of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foriegn language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the begining of the movie is actually the end. We see the begining and think it's the begining as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from begining to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "Tom Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock n' roll, an era in which even the wildest music still reflected a certain innocence, long since gone if not forgotten, before the advent of Metal, Rap and Grunge.  It's 1964, and `That Thing You Do!' is about to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie, Pa., who call themselves the `Oneders (pronounced Wonders),' but who are destined to begin their musical odyssey know as the `Oh-NEED-ers.'  Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his father's appliance store, but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before a gig, Guy is asked to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the right place at the right time for Guy, like when Ringo joined The Beatles, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.<br/><br/>\tIt's a lively, upbeat tale in which luck, talent and chance all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of making it in the music buisness, including the adrenaline rush of hearing one's own song on the radio for the first time, as well as all the hoopla that surrounds those who happen to be in the spotlight at the moment.  But he also shows the downside:  The creative differences and in-fighting which plagues just about any band ever formed to some degree at one time or another, the personality conflicts and petty jealousies that are apt to surface at any time, and the reality of dealing with bloated egos, adoring fans and rude, insensitive record label executives who could care less about the talent that is putting the coins in their coffers, as long as they're selling records.<br/><br/>\tFor the most part, Hanks keeps it lighthearted and cheerful, which-- along with the orignal songs (some of which he helped write)-- makes this an entertaining, fun and thoroughly enjoyable movie.  He sugar-coats the dark side of it all to a certain extent, which makes the bad things that happen a bit easier to swallow, though it compromises the impact of the events somewhat as they unfold.  Then again, he manages to maintain the credibility and integrity of his story, and after all, `this' is the film he wanted to make, and he presents it exactly as intended.  Hanks captures a sense of time and place with this film, and also that same sense of reality conveyed by The Beatles' film, `A Hard Day's Night,' intentionally avoiding the more stoic reality of the more recent `Allmost Famous.'  All three films are fairly true to life, but with varying degrees of honesty.  It's a matter of wether to `imply,' as Hanks has done, or to be explicit, as Cameron Crowe chose to do with his film.<br/><br/>\tWith this film Hanks proves that he is equally as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it; he knows exactly where he wants to take his audience and when, and he does it quite successfully.  He also extracts some nice performances from his actors, especially Scott, Johnathon Schaech (Jimmy, the lead singer), Steve Zahn (Lenny, on guitar) and Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan, Jimmy's girlfriend, who takes the brunt of the blunt edge of Jimmy's sudden notoriety.  Hanks also turns in a notable performance himself, as Mr. White, the representative of one of the labels interested in the Oneders.<br/><br/>\tThe supporting cast includes Ethan Embry (The Bass Player), Charlize Theron (Tina), Obba Babatunde (Lamarr), Giovanni Ribisi (Chad), Chris Ellis (Phil), Alex Rocco (Sol), Bill Cobbs (Del Paxton), Peter Scolari (Tony), Rita Wilson (Marguerite), Chris Isaak (Uncle Bob) and Kevin Pollak (Boss Koss).  What `Happy Days' was to television, `That Thing You Do!' is to movies; a film that evokes that perceived sense of  innocence of a time when life at least seemed simpler.  For the more distance you put between the present and the `Good old days,' the better they get.  In reality, they may not have been better, but Hanks preserves that illusion by giving us a picture of the way we'd at least like to think things were.  And it's more than a pleasant diversion; this is a feel-good film you'll be able to enjoy time and again, becasue it takes you to a place you'd like to be-- a place you've been to before at one time or another, in one way or another, if only in your mind. And that Hanks can take you there so readily is not only a credit to his talent, but another fine example of the pure magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",
    "Akira Kurosawa's 1985, Ran, is based one of Shakespeare's greatest works, King's Lear. The Film proudly stands along with his other classic such as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Roshomon, Sanjuro and the Hidden Fortress. He is a master in the art of filmmaking, no one can film an epic battle scene quite like Kurosawa. This is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by Akira Kurosawa, it was at that time, Japan's most expensive film ever. Being at the age of 75, he still showed us, he's one of the best in the business.<br/><br/>This movie is about an aging lord, head of the Ichimonji family, decides to retire and to pass the power to Taro, the eldest of his three sons. He will however have to banish Saburo, the youngest one, who dared to speak the truth to him. Soon, the former lord is chased away from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to kill him. The three brothers are fighting for control of the Kingdom, as their lust for power grows every day. Four armies are facing each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is nothing but a distant memory.<br/><br/>Akira Kurosawa redefines what an epic film is, with astonishing story telling, entirely believable characters and real life battle scenes without the use of Special effects/CGI. He retells the story of King Lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But just like Shakespeare, there is humor, irony, death and not a happy ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this film, deserves some kind of recognition. The acting is pretty much excellent and certainly believable.<br/><br/>10/10 Kurosawa is a Genius",
    "First off, the downsides: Some parts of the movie seemed a little drawn out, the film was two hours, and at certain times, you could feel that. It's far-fetched, and I can imagine some people rolling their eyes at the storyline, and there WILL be some people walking out saying \"that was a stupid movie\". (As many people responded to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.) Of course, some of them will be saying that in response to the sheer amount of gore and violence, which brings me into the 'upsides': This movie certainly had it's 'wow' moments with shock, anticipation, and gore, especially near the climax. Scenes and even alleyways and monsters from the games were allmost identical. If you've played the games you will get a lot of deja vu. (For example, the camera goes crooked at exactly the same time and place it does in one of the scenes in the game.) Also, a lot of the sounds and music tracks from the games are used, and so are the monsters. The entire feel of the games is preserved in the film, and you will have trouble keeping your feet on the floor the entire movie. The creepy presentation works, and if you haven't played any of the games, this movie will scare you in new ways.",
    "I have to say that the most fun I had at the movies this summer was when I saw American Pie, the funniest picture I've seen since last summer's There's Something About Mary. This movie has taken the classic teenage boy film (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for the 90's.  It is hilarious from start to finish. If you like physical comedy, gross out comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all.  A grat ensemble cast of likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch.     <br/><br/>I think this year's breakout star has to be Chris Klein.  He was phenomenal in Election and he is even better here as a jock who tries to soften his image to score before prom. I have a feeling Klein is going to be Hollywood's next big thing and I hope he has a chance to flex his acting muscles in some different movies (I can defiantly see this guy in an action film).<br/><br/>Also very good is Jason Biggs who plays the sympathetic Jim character, the guy who is least likely to lose his virginity.  His antics are very funny to follow and he gets the lion share of the laughs. Finally a huge ovation for Eugene Levy, who gets major laughs as the Jim's dad.",
    "Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to dissapoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.<br/><br/>This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.<br/><br/>In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word \"epic\" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from grate to amazing. I defiantly recomend this film to everyone, but you realy should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "The imaginative but well-conceived idea of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. Spielberg's movie Always(1989) had classy use of visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with mystery-based expectations. Yet, Always lacked the sense of essential romance concept, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline in Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.<br/><br/>However, Ghost accomplished of what \"Always\" tried and failed to accomplish. Thanks to the grat acting trio of Patrick Swayze + Demi Moore + Whoopi Goldberg, for together they registered indelible moments into Ghost. It is scraped in our memory how in time Molly and Sam happen to keep their thoughts off each others' feelings, and that taught us: \"Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts\". On this account they never called off their faith on believing that they will keep an enduring love affair. These indelible scenes in Ghost are conceptually cut where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is an imperishable cinematic instant. <br/><br/>I was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both watching the Ghost on TV, both talking on the phone. Then that scene came upon(Sam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's body), I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I'm talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing, and keep saying to me: \"I will never forget the first time you kissed me and I don't need to be alive to recall this\" Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss in movies of all time. MTV had honoured this kiss as well, several years after the release of the movie, as the best kiss in '90s. Superimposing that, the scenes where Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam's ghost is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows what nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only, are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.<br/><br/>To watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.",
    "Dinosaurs. Amusement Park. Tourists. Disaster.<br/><br/>Jurassic World has them all.<br/><br/>Naturally, I had to see it.<br/><br/>The begining holds much promiss, and it gets your hopes up for the disaster to come. When it does, there are some grate action sequences, especially ones with the glass ball containing the soft, chewy child centre.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the final act unravels into outright farce.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt is grate as the affable yet bad-ass Raptor Whisperer. He's got an easy going charisma that could easily carry an iconic character like Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire Dearing, the uptight park manager, who initially clashes with the laid back Owen. Of course you know where the tension goes.<br/><br/>The film tries to flesh out Claire's character by throwing in her two nephews (someone and another kid), who do double duty as McGuffins.<br/><br/>Vincent D'Onofrio shows up as Hoskins, a villainous representative of the military-industrial complex angling to weaponize velociraptors. He's all sneers and scenery chewing, so obviously evil he's got a goatee. D'Onofrio does it well but the evil plan he's been saddled with by the writers makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>The director, Colin Trevorrow, said in interviews that he wanted the dinosaurs to act like real animals, not cartoon monsters. Quelle surprize! I had no idea, as he has well-fed winged dinos (or near enough to dinos) go on a crazed orgy of violence against hapless tourists. Why? Becuase cool action sequence!<br/><br/>One poor soul is even treated to the most outlandishly elongated death sequence I've ever seen, all to no end. It didn't justify anything, paid nothing back, offered no comeuppance. It was just gleeful indulgence in sadistic torture of a minor character. It was an Itchy & Scratchy moment.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the final act: turn off your brain before it begins.<br/><br/>The first movie proved you could have a smart script and dinosaurs in the same movie. After that, the IQ of the series dropped with each outing. The first one had chaos theory and amber and DNA extraction and cleverness up the whazoo. It was AWESOME.<br/><br/>What does this one have? Hackneyed evil plans, a clunky plot, and characters so smart they run from T-Rex's in high heels.<br/><br/>The franchise has had a lobotomy.",
    "It may be true that everyone during their lifetime has fifteen minutes of fame, even if in most cases it only lasts about a minute and a half.  And if that minute and a half comes early in life, how far into adulthood can you carry it with you, and when does a healthy memory become an obsession that finally blurs the line between reality and fantasy?  `The Fan,' directed by Tony Scott and starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes, is an intense and disturbing motion picture that examines that moment and the effects it can have on the lives of those either directly or indirectly involved.  Here, the focus is on one Gil Renard (De Niro), a knife salesman in San Francisco and a die-hard Giants fan who is pumped about the acquisition during the off-season of superstar centerfielder Bobby Rayburn (Snipes), whom he believes will bring a pennant to the team.  Once a player himself-- a pitcher-- Renard's life has since been on a downhill slide.  Divorced, he has a young, little league aged son, Richie (Andrew J. Ferchland), with whom he has an unsettling relationship, and at work, his sales have been so poor his job is on the line.  An angry, disturbed individual, Renard has reached a pivotal point in his life; for inspiration, he continually returns to the philosophies of the catcher from his playing days, Coop (Charles Hallahan), whom he considers one of the finest athletes he ever knew.  And as his life continues to deteriorate, his obsessions begin to add further to the imbalance of his perceptions of reality, which finally lead him past a point of no return.<br/><br/>\tScott's film, of course, has less to do with baseball than it does with how the game itself actually relates to life and the things that realy matter. As Rayburn says at one point, `We're not curing cancer here.'  But to those to whom life has been reduced to that minute and a half to which they still cling, the game can be everything.  And it is just that unhealthy obsession that Scott examines in this film, that comparatively insignificant moment that in the obsessive mind becomes an episode of monumental importance that finally distorts any semblance of reality the individual may have left. What's truly frightening is that upon close scrutiny, in Renard there is much with which many viewers will be able to relate in one way or another: The anger, the frustration and perhaps the inability to let go of that minute and a half, even when it threatens to become more than just a pleasant memory, but an unhealthy lifeline to another place and another time that, in reality, may never have existed in the first place.  It's like a search for self-esteem by the has-been-who-never-was, who can neither realize nor accept it's elusiveness.  As Renard says to Richie, `Baseball is better than life, becuase it's fair.  You hit a sacrifice fly and it doesn't count against your average.'  An ideal that has forever eluded Renard; in his life, he's never been able to `give himself up for the team' and get anything in return for it.<br/><br/>\tAs Renard, De Niro gives an explosive performance that at first glance may seem to have a bit of Travis Bickle and Max Cady in it-- which in fact it does-- though upon closer inspection, Renard is a unique character.  Those with a disturbed mind may have traits in common, as these characters De Niro has portrayed certainly do; but De Niro has successfully given each of them an individual personality, and when viewed side by side, the differences are readily apparrent.  Bickle may be a sociopath, Cady a cold blooded killer; but Renard is a man who was just never able to get a handle on his life and has allowed his obsessions to dictate the choices he has made along the way. De Niro is simply a master of his craft, with the ability to make his characters so real that a performance like this one is often overlooked; this is Oscar worthy work for which he never received the acclaim he was due.  His Renard is so like someone you would run into in your everyday life that in retrospect, it's scary.  But it's the kind of performance we've come to expect from De Niro, and as usual, he does not disappoint.<br/><br/>\tWesley Snipes, as well, gives a solid performance as Rayburn that is one of his best ever, which is not surprising when you consider with whom he was working.  If you study De Niro's films, you may discover a common thread running through them with regard to his co-stars.  De Niro has the ability to make those with whom he is working better; and it's something that stays with them forever after.  Consider Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep before `The Deer Hunter,' or Ed Harris before `Jacknife.'  Certainly they were exceptional talents before, but they have arguably been better since. And Snipes is no exception.  Nor is Benicio Del Toro (Recipient of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for `Traffic'), who gives a memorable turn here as Rayburn's rival outfielder, Juan Primo.  <br/><br/>\tThe supporting cast includes Patti D'Arbanville (Ellen),Ellen Barkin (Jewel), John Leguizamo (Manny), Chris Mulkey (Tim), Dan Butler (Garrity) and Brandon Hammond (Sean).  A thought provoking thriller that gives some real insight into the cause and effect of the psyche of human nature, `The Fan' is like an open wound that may hit too close to home for some.  And to dismiss this as just a `baseball' movie or another `action' flick would be a mistake, for there is much more here than meets the eye.  In the end, those who pay attention will ultimately reap the rewards it proffers.  I rate this one 9/10.",
    "This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.<br/><br/>It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. <br/><br/>Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.<br/><br/>We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. <br/><br/>But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.<br/><br/>It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but becuase it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10.",

    "Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. \"Are you not entertained?!\"",
    "The Sixth Sense enjoys being playful with our imagination. What your eyes see is not exactly what it is. What your mind paints is not exactly what there is. In the world of The Sixth Sense logic is your worst enemy.<br/><br/>There are obvious (and sometimes less obvious) hints right in front of you but you don't grasp them becasue of your preconceptions and premises. I once read a novel called 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' which used similer techniques found in this movie, but in writeing. I'm sure you will enjoy this book as much as I did, if you like to be intellectually surprised.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, don't read reviews and don't talk to your friends who have already seen it. The movie is very much susceptible to spoilers. It is suffice to say that the ending is just shockingly delightful.<br/><br/>I don't consider this movie heavily philosophical or thought-provoking. Having said that, it is one of the movies I love to watch again and again.",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to beleive anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehical on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Back to the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car \"DeLorean\" in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love \"Back to the Future\" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.<br/><br/>I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a grat direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writeing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I realy did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. <br/><br/>Back to the Future Part II (1989)<br/><br/>The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. <br/><br/>Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.<br/><br/>Things I realy didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awfull person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightening with \"DeLorean\" and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles. I am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the role of Jennifer but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part II wierd. <br/><br/>This film get's 8 \"Back to the Future\" is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV becasue it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore.",
    "***May contain Spoilers***<br/><br/>I was embarrassed as an American seeing this film. Just knowing that it would be seen over seas. It's amazing how a submarine can withstand 40 depth charges while another could be put out by two. And I beleive it would also be a virtual impossibility for Americans to commandeer a German sub and vice versa.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this movie is its arrogant rewriting of history. It was the British who first captured the enigma machine NOT the Americans. We have no right to take credit for other nations accomplishments. Hollywood simply has a historical ignorence. But beyond that it is still just an awfull, aweful movie. No one with half a brain would be entertained by this garbage.",
    "While book racks are brimming with thought provoking, high concept science fiction, the movie genre tends to be populated by invading aliens, intergalactic wars, and adventure, which makes Director and co-writer Duncan Jones' Moon that much more of an oddity.<br/><br/>Not since Steven Soderbergh's much overlooked 2002 rendition of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris has a movie firmly rooted in the sci-fi realm delivered reflections on the human condition, which Moon does deftly.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only inhabitant of an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from lunar rocks to be shipped back to Earth to fuel the energy starved planet.<br/><br/>Sam's isolated three year posting is about to come to an end and he longs to return to Earth to see his wife. His only company throughout this sojourn has been that of Gerty, the base's HAL-like robot voiced by Kevin Spacey. Unfortunately, the final weeks and days are proving to be the most difficult, and Sam finds himself going a bit squirrelly, leaving both he and the audience to wonder if what's unfolding is actually happening, or merely a drama taking place in his addled mind.<br/><br/>That's about as much plot detail as I'm going to deliver, for to delve any deeper into the story would give too much away. Be prepared, however, for a thought provoking narrative that touches on issues such as scientific ethics, corporate greed, human identity, and compassion.<br/><br/>There are no aliens, lasers/phasers, wormholes, warp engines or jump drives here, just a lonely space age concierge, an unflappable monotone robot, and a whole lot of fodder for your brain to chow down on.<br/><br/>This is what science fiction was meant to be.",
    "Beyond its compelling subject matter \"Judgement At Neuremberg\" revolutionizes the court room drama genre. The camera swings and swerves and dives between the lines of this exemplary Abby Mann script. Stanley Kramer conducts his orchestra of iconic stars with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. The language barriers and the confinement of the action masterfully resolved. Spencer Tracy is simply magnificent and, as per usual, we beleive every word that comes out of his mouth. His judge is an American monument of unsentimental humanity. Twentynine year old Maimilian Schell won the Oscar as best actor and his performance survived the test of time with the vigor of his conviction. Montgomery Cliff makes his short minutes on the screen, one of those memorable moments that nobody that has ever seen it will be able to forget. The man and the character merging into one chilling, shattering truth. \"I am half the man I've ever been\" Marlene Dietrich gives to her German aristocrat a legendary star quality. And Judy Garland, overweight and allmost unrecognizable breaks your heart and gets her last Oscar nomination. My only troubles came with the stoic Burt Lancaster becasue I could never forget it was Burt Lancaster and with Richard Widmark's strident prosecutor. I have seen \"Judgement At Neuremberg\" more than a dozen times and it never ceases to amaze me that no matter the darkness of the subject it always manages to entertain and inspire.",

    "Many people were disappointed with 'Jackie Brown' when it was first released as it didn't live up to their expectations created by the more flamboyant 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I admit that I was one of those disappointed fans. But as the years have gone by I have come to appreciate this movie more and more, and if you deal with what it IS and not what you thought it was going to be, you'll see that it is an underrated gem of a movie. 'Jackie Brown' is much more character driven and leisurely plotted than Tarantino's previous two movies. I haven't read the Elmore Leonard novel on which it was based so I can't tell wether this was a consious decision by Tarantino himself, or it's becuase of the source material, but it might be a stumbling block for those with MTV-style attention spans. 1970s crime movie buffs will find it much easier going. The big names in the cast like De Niro, Jackson and Fonda are all very good, but the real standout performances in this movie are by 70s blaxploitation icon Pam Grier ('Coffy', 'Foxy Brown', 'Black Mama White Mama',etc.etc.) and a revelatory one from Robert Forster. Forster back in the day showed plenty of promiss in movies like 'Medium Cool' but quickly found himself stuck in b-grade exploitation movies like 'Vigilante' and 'Alligator'. Fun stuff, but hardly Oscar material. Max Cherry is the best role he has ever been given, and he is superb in it. The facinating thing about 'Jackie Brown' for me is that Tarantino's critics accuse him of making shallow and violent self-consciously hip crime films, but the central story of this movie concerns an inter-racial Middle Aged romance, something I haven't seen done in a believable or realistic fashion by Hollywood before. By doing this so well Tarantino shows he has much more depth, and is a much more interesting and braver film maker than his more acclaimed contemporaries. 'Jackie Brown' is a fine movie that hopefully one day will get the kudos it deserves. Don't overlook this one just becasue it isn't 'Pulp Fiction The Next Generation'!",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and grat fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a grate message, and is grate for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and realy seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that grate. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are grat and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are grat too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "Everyone acts very well, and the whole film would have been realy good if it hadn't been for this wierd narrator the whole way through who sounded like he was telling children a story even when saying things like \"they went to bed together\". It was wierd. I also feel if it had been more dialogue based we could have got a greater grasp of the characters. I watched it without subtitles but understood the relationship of Juan Antonio and his ex-wife (mostly spoken in Spanish) than I did of Doug and Vicky which just seemed to lack a huge amount of depth. There needed to be some redeeming feature Vicky and Doug's relationship.<br/><br/>Anyway well acted but yeah the narrator ruins it. Javier Bardem is amazing as usual.",
    "The third film about the young wizard is the most controversial, for it was he who split the fans of the novels about Potter into two warring parties: conservatives and innovators.<br/><br/>The first group of fans absolutely condemned and condemned the actions of the director Cuaron, altered \"Harry Potter\" in his own way. Say, they did not like the strange werewolf, all sorts of jokes-jokes, interspersed by the director in addition to the script, and in addition to all the claims they discovered the disappearance of the atmosphere of magic, becasue of which the popular expression of \"Quaron in the furnace\" was born.<br/><br/>The second group, on the contrary, furiously began to praise Cuaron, extolling him to the unprecedented pedestal of fame, thus creating allmost a cult of personality. They liked everything that only they could like in the third film.<br/><br/>Only now it became clear that both sides are not right in their convictions. So it should be, movies must be different in essence. The error crept in from the very begining: Chris Columbus took the first two films, and this put the old debate on what kind of movies Harry Potter should be about. Columbus did not have to give the right to shoot two films, and one would suffice. Spectators are used to the atmosphere of the first two films, becuase most of the audience took the innovative approach of Quaron to the screen version of the third novel with bayonets. Now the producers make a mistake again - they give the right to shoot two films (The Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince) to the new director David Yates. This should not be done in any case. It is neccessary to preserve the diversity of director's visions. Hogwarts is not accidentaly depicted in different ways in films, like Hogsmeade. Everything in novels is seen differently every time, becuase all the reader and viewer sees through the eyes of Harry Potter, and in films through the prism of the director's vision, the viewer must percieve the magical world through the eyes of a young wizard.\nAlfonso Cuaron still hit the spot with his timely vision of the plot of \"The Prisoner of Azkaban.\"<br/><br/>He created a sparkling tragicomedy for the growing up of a young wizard.<br/><br/>In general, Cuaron's film reminds me of our old Soviet films. For the reason that the whole film can be easily taken away on the shots, quotes, fragments, heroes, soundtracks, etc., etc.\nDespite everything, this film is much kinder than the previous two, differing in their gloomy Gothic style. It's more fun, crazy, and it should be, becasue it's Sirius Black himself on the scene!<br/><br/>For the whole of Rowling's novel, like the film of Quaron, is a tribute to the memory of the crazy, hooliganistic and such lonely Sirius Black ... Black, whose heart is beating violently, hot blood flows in his veins, and in the soul is truly dog devotion.\nThe third film, as well as the film, is dedicated to the looters - James Potter (= Harry Potter), Peter Pettigrew, Rimus Lupine and Sirius Black - a group of friends who used to be friends a long time ago ...<br/><br/>The film ruthlessly shows how easy it is to lose friendship and how difficult it is to adquire a freind ...<br/><br/>Thanks to Alfonso Cuaron, who did a talented work, showing in one stroke all the huge gallery of the characters of the magical world and their essence: the Minister of Magic plunges into a puddle; the soothsayer with big glasses on her nose stumbles on her own table; The evil teacher Severus Snape closes the children from the werewolf; eccentric Dumbledore slams his hand over Ron's gnarled leg; Remus Lupine, at the lesson, takes a snack with an apple; portraits of Hogwarts, it turns out, also like to sleep; Stan Shanpike with his brave words is not very strong in dragging student suitcases; Hagrid and ties are incompatible things; Tom from the Leaky Cauldron has a nehyl auto; Ernie, wearing spectacles with large lenses, is led by the \"Night Knight\"; Sirius Black finally began to talk moral nonsense ...\nAlso it is necessery to thank the new actors, so successfully merged into the old line-up:<br/><br/>Emma Thompson (Sibyl Trelawney); Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore); David Thulis (Remus Lupine); Julie Christie (Madame Rosmerta); Gary Oldman (Sirius Black); Timothy Spall (Peter Pettigrew) and many others. By the way, if my memory does not change me, then the two actors from the third film (cleaning woman in the bar \"Leaky Cauldron\" and Aunt Marge) Quaron quietly consigned to his other project - \"Child of Man\", but that's another story ...<br/><br/>Let me love the fourth film about Harry Potter (director - Mike Newell), but I always revise the Curaron part - it is the brightest of all existing.<br/><br/>In a word, long live Rowling and Cuaron!<br/><br/>\"Potter, come back!\" (Severus Snape, potions teacher).",
    "Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis' best performance ever.<br/><br/>What sets 12 Monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality is actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from or goes to.  Also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, cannot be stopped or changed.  As Willis asserts \"It's already happened,\" while he's in a mental hospital, the major dilema the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it's Willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself.  It's a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by Peoples and Gilliam's unique brand of dementia.<br/><br/>Besides this, 12 Monkey's storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is lifted out of Hitchcock's Vertigo.  All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.<br/><br/>Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery.  With cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters.  The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering-on-madness characters.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination.  As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman.   Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis' psychologist.  She holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to beleive is a false 'religion.'<br/><br/>Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape.  Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness.  Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.<br/><br/>10 out of 10",
    "One of the early scenes in \"Pulp Fiction\" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, becasue it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" wouldn't be \"Pulp Fiction.\" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.<br/><br/>It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a grat work of abstract art, or \"art about art.\" It has all the characteristics we associate with grat movies: fine writeing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.<br/><br/>The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desparate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.<br/><br/>Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, \"Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,\" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, \"That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.\"<br/><br/>What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets becasue it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.<br/><br/>There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring wether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.<br/><br/>Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are realy \"about\" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film realy a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.",
    "I've been writeing reviews for IMDb for ten years, and I think something fishy is going on here. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is getting very, very high reviews from the vast majority of IMDb reviewers -- but the nine and ten- star reviews are all getting pelted with \"negative\" marks, earning scores of \"1 out of 15\" likes.<br/><br/>So what's the problem? The problem is that this movie wasn't supposed to be a hit. The mass audience wasn't supposed to respond to the story of young black men facing oppression and comming out on top. The American people were not supposed to see the real truth about how their police treat minorities every day. <br/><br/>Quick, let's bury the good reviews! Let's spawn a phony backlash! Let's discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the basis of things they did twenty years ago. Oh, and let's all get sentimental about Eazy E becasue he's dead, and young black men are okay once they're dead. The dead ones are no longer scary and threatening. <br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that the people who made it actually dared to portray young, angry black men as heroic, not as criminals or predators. It's okay to glamorize white criminals, becuase Hollywood was built on that. From PUBLIC ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, white audiences have always loved to sentimentalize their own criminals. But you can't do that with black men who rap about crime, even when they aren't actually criminals themselves. When Cagney postures like a thug in some ancient piece of crap that's cool. But when black men do it today that's dangerous and irresponsible!<br/><br/>There are very powerful elements in this country that are terribly frightened by this movie. They're frightened becuase this movie gets white audiences to see young black men as something other than dangerous criminals. The scenes of NWA being roughed up by police are a terrible threat to the powerful elements in our society, who stay in power only by keeping white people scared of black men. They can't tolerate the idea of black male victims, so they instantly start a media backlash portraying the victims as criminals.<br/><br/>I say this is a good movie, a powerful, exciting film that presents a side of American life that is allmost never seen on the screen. I know I'm not going to get many likes for this review, but what the hell. <br/><br/>I've got enough already.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends becasue he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went becuase it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the begining right up untill the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with allmost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "Yeah you heard me... Footloose is based on a TRUE STORY. Unlikely as it seems, it realy happened in the small town of Elmore City, Oklahoma in 1980. My dad, Leonard Coffee (a.k.a. Ren McCormack a.k.a. Kevin Bacon...all breakfast items? what a coincidence...lol) was a junior at Elmore City High School. This was a miniscule town, with a population of around 750, and there were about 50 or so Baptist churches...so naturally the town's rules and regulations were a bit extreem. There was an archaic town ordinance that banned dancing in public, and it hadn't been abolished. Elmore had never had a junior/senior prom! So my dad fought the system with the help of his best freind, Rex Kennedy (the junior class president), and they were allowed to have a prom for the first time, and Elmore has had prom every year since. I don't know who sold the story, but unfortunately we got no money lol! There were a few things in the movie that didn't actually happen (Ariel Moore, Reverend Moore, the book burning, oh and playing chicken on the tractors!), but it is mostly accurate. The kids did have to go to surrounding communities like Pauls Valley and Lindsay to dance and party, and my dad drove the exact same car that Ren drives in the movie! So there you have it, the REAL story of Footloose. If you haven't seen it...watch it!",
    "When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about the Best Foriegn Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experiance, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a grat future ahead of them.<br/><br/>Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn't know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal's nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal's story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.<br/><br/>Incendies already had grat source material. I've praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It's impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely becasue I can't imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there's some realy grate acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn't autobiographical.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on grat filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve's advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne's lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn't recieve critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.<br/><br/>There are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely sucessful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could've lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that realy resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the grate fame of Denis Villeneuve.",

    "With workers striking in Russia, the crew of the battleship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me  surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the orignal score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.<br/><br/>The feel of the film was a suprise to me becuase it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the media but also a cracking good film in its own right.",

    "I've seen the movie just a bit earlier and although my expectations were very high, this movie satisfied me very well. As we already know Turkish movie sector has lack of visual effects. That is actually the reason behind why we usually don't enjoy Turkish Action kind of films. But in this movie we see lots of grate examples of best visual effects. And also it has its own realistic scenes as well. The connection between soldiers were so grat, enthusiastic and natural. Also the connection between the first movie with this one was grat so this movie actually deserves its rate. Besides from good visual and sound effects the movie has also its own story-line which was perfect. As I mentioned before even though my expectations were realy high this movie is even beyond my expectations. Thanks for letting us joy this kind of masterpiece Mr. Alper Caglar.",
    "I have never written a review here, but I felt compelled to actually step up and defend this movie.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy was everything I expected it to be. It couldn't be too close to the previous Bourne films, but had to be close enough to let us know a storm is coming.<br/><br/>Bourne's presance throughout the film is what spins this story into action and I felt it was balanced perfectly. We all want Bourne, but this is Aaron Cross's story. Renner and Weisz were grate, but I think the scripting has been derided by many as terrible. I had no issues with anything and even felt compelled by Renner's character motivation. This was someone yearning to be more, not someone who was already better than everyone else, but just couldn't remember.<br/><br/>Let's cross our fingers and hope we all get what we want and pair Bourne and Cross in the next film.<br/><br/>There is so much more going on than just Jason Bourne and if we don't get to explore that then the franchise will be poorer for it!",
    "This is the raunchiest of the Scary Movies. If you thought the orignal was \"too much\", well, this one will truly give you more reasons to avoid it for it's vulgar content and crude sex jokes. That's for you, easily offended people. <br/><br/>I had a grate time with it when it first came out in theaters. I realy liked the crude sex humor and vulgar spoofs. So for those who are into sex jokes and scatological humor, you will be amused.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is truly hilarious and in my opinion, the best part of the movie. It was about time that the \"Scary Movie\" franchise had an Exorcist spoof! It was grat. James Woods in the role of Father Merrin delivers a hysterical performance relying most of his scenes on scatological humor and profanity. For example, when Reagan says \"f*** me\" and he imediately jumps into her and simulates to be penetrating her. Another example is the line where Reagan's mother says \"she won't even let me touch her!\" and the priest responds \"yeah sometimes that happens, you have to give candy to the children\" (or something like that); obviously referring to recent pederastry cases. On the other side, the movie also has \"classical\" but always effective teen humor . For example, when entering the room for the first time, he gets scared and runs away when Reagan turns her head on 180º; and the always effective vomiting cycle. <br/><br/>After the Exorcist spoof, the movie centers on the Poltergeist and Entity spoofs. That's when the movie takes a new direction and does not changes from it. Expect spoofs from popular t.v. commercials, songs (Vitamin C), and even racist and homophobic jokes. The sex jokes worth a watch specially on the infamous clown scene, and the sex ghost. <br/><br/>\"Scary Movie 2\" does not \"cross\" the line on the vulgar factor. It's just a good rated R movie with spoofs for all tastes; of course, if you are not easily offended. But be sure to watch it on DVD; do not watch the t.v. version becuase it's very cut (specially on dialogs).<br/><br/>This is in my opinion the best of the \"Scary Movies\".",
    "Don't look at the movie the way it is. You can hate it for whatever reasons you like but this movie isn't just stupid, soulless and pointless sexual fantasy. There is more thought put into it than you could ever imagine. Too bad critics panned the movie for the things that couldn't comprehend and the audience went with it.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a big fantasy that does not exist or happening in the real world. The movie is actually about Sweet Pea(Abbie Cornish). She is the star of the show. Snyder made that very clear from the start. Babydoll(Emily Browning) is a figment of Sweet Pea's imagination. She is the physical embodiment of Sweet Pea. She is the 5th thing. She is the guardian angel that Sweet Pea created to deal with her trash life. The entire film is a reflection of the internal struggle of Sweet Pea. That's why she is the one who's narrating the film. The stuff that we've seen with Babydoll during the first act, that's all Sweet Pea acting out her past trauma in her mind, just as she was taught to do in the mental institution. That's why the movie opens on a stage that direct parallel to how Sweet Pea is acting out that same trauma on a stage when Babydoll first arrives in the mental institution aka the theater. After that, the lobotomy comes, the key to everything that happens in the movie. Reimagined through Babydoll perspective, Sweet Pea disassociates from reality when the needle plunges into her brain, retreating into her mind in the same way she's taught to by Dr. Gorski. She's not in the real world anymore. This is also what happened in Sweet Pea's real life. And the effect of that lobotomy is the goddamned movie. Yes, this movie is the result of a lobotomy. Just one big subconscious coping mechanism for Sweet Pea to find peace. And this girl is able to interrupt the lobotomy, intruding on her own story. She's even able to repurpose the accidental killing of her sister into a deliberate and necessery sacrifice on her sister's part to save her. In this second layer of fantasy, Sweet Pea imagines herself and the rest of the girls working in a brothel, objectified and lusted after by an audience. This mirrors us tuning in to see these girls perform for us in various outfits. This connection is made clear from the opening of the film, which lets us know that we're the audience watching all this unfold on stage. By choosing to watch the movie, we are complicit in everything that's happening. Of course, this doesn't mean to condemn you for wanting to see nubile girls kicking ass. What this movie is realy about is the diffrence between empowerment and exploitation. This is represented through three layers of fantasy, first was the mental institution, second is the brothel, third is the fantasy-action scenes, each exploring a different set of social values, each aligning with different phases of the feminist movement. First up is a grim incarnation of the '60s -the mental institution- set during the second wave of the feminist movement, when gender inequality was much more widespread. That gender inequality is amplified in the second world -the brothel- which takes us back even further, to a time when women were literally treated like property. And finally we have the pop culture world -the world of today, action scenes- which imagines Babydoll's dancing through various aspects of modern geek culture, dressing the girls up in all the typical fetishistic attire we've come to expect video games, TV, movies, etc... Sweet Pea is aware of how sick this is and rejects that Baby Doll's dancing could possibly be empowering. It's only through seeing its effect on men does she start to see how much power they realy have, as the girls start taking back the control they've lost by using men's objectification of them to their advantage. By embracing their sexuality instead of fearing it, they learn that their inherent femininity can be better used as a means of holding men under their sway. Suddenly, it's the men who become helpless instead of them. Point being, men may be in a position to physically overpower women, but women have the power to psychologically overpower men, thus inverting history's long-standing power dynamic between men and women. This is then mirrored to very much the same effect in the action fantasy scenarios - a symbolic gesture on Snyder's part to show women taking back geek culture, which men have been dominating with their boy club mentality and pervasive misogyny for far too long. This is demonstrated further once we cut back to Babydoll's lobotomy after Sweet Pea has found peace. While Sweet Pea busy imagining that she's taking the magic school bus to a better world, Blue has plans of his own. But its no use, she's already escaped, even if it's only mentally. Sweet Pea sacrifices her body -Babydoll- and retreats into the comfort of her own mind, a paradise over which nobody has control of but her. Blue may have control over her body, but without her mind, he has nothing. The importance of this is also aparent during Babydoll's encounter with the High Roller, who recognizes that the choice to truly be with someone lies with you and you alone. As the scene with the High Roller reaffirms, the distinction between exploitation and empowerment all comes down to personal choice. And that is just half of the point this movie trying to make. Women deserve just as much control over their bodies as they have over their minds. You can interpret this movie so many ways, it's beyond belief. It gives you so many options to think. It's realy funny that the one who made this kind of a movie and the one who is trying to defend it is a male. But it is what it is. If this movie made by someone like Stanley Kubrick, probably everyone would have tried to decipher the depth of it and wouldn't have even minded the bad reviews.<br/><br/>It's realy sad that people turn off their brains and see everything literal, and never uses their brain to read the images that appear on the screen when they see a Snyder film.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best freind who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well allmost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recomend.",
    "\"Atonement\" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood freind. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. <br/><br/>Act I begins like an upper-class comedy of manners. The setting is the Tallis family's stately home, on a hot summer's day in 1935. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old with ambitions to be a writer, has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins, but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them. Robbie has fallen in love with Cecilia and accidentaly sends her a sexually explicit love-letter. In other circumstances this might have resulted in disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one. The tone of the film changes abruptly, however, when Briony's cousin Lola is sexually assaulted. Lola cannot identify her assailant, but Briony, who was a witness, falsely accuses Robbie. As a result, he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison. <br/><br/>In Act II, set in 1940, Robbie, released from jail, is now a soldier with the British Army in France. He is desperately trying to reach Dunkirk ahead of the advancing Germans, kept going not by fighting spirit or patriotism, but by the hope of returning to Cecilia, who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment, becomeing estranged from her family as a result. In Act III we see Briony, now eighteen, as a volunteer nurse in a London hospital. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help him clear his name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apart.<br/><br/>After \"The Last King of Scotland\" and \"Becomeing Jane\", James McEvoy is the rising male star of the British cinema, and his performance here is the best yet that I have seen. Whereas Dr Garrigan in \"The Last King\" was morally flawed, and Lefroy in \"Becomeing Jane\" hid his better nature beneath a roguish exterior, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy succeeds in conveying his character's basic decency, achieving the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is another rising British star, and this is her second film with director Joe Wright after \"Pride and Prejudice\". Although she was good in the comedy \"Bend it like Beckham\", I think that her films with Wright are her best, suggesting that her future lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" in which she seemed miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the loveliest, but also the liveliest and most spirited heroine of any film I have seen recently. Special mentions must also go to Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and to Vanessa Redgrave who plays the now-elderly Briony in the epilogue, set in 1999. I felt, however, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. <br/><br/>This was only Wright's second feature film, and he has already established himself as an accomplished director. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a good film, but \"Atonement\" is better. Ian McEwan's book is among the best novels of recent years, and I doubt if any cinematic treatment could capture all its nuances. One of its themes in particular, the debate between literary traditionalism and modernism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wright and the scriptwriter Christopher Hampton wisely steer clear of it. Hampton, who has turned the book into a very good screenplay, keeps McEwan's final twist, although it is here presented in a different way, with Briony revealing the truth in an TV interview. <br/><br/>If, however, the film does not capture all the literary nuances of the novel, Wright makes up for this with his extraordinary visual imagination, something sometimes lacking in films based upon novels. \"Atonement\" joins that list of films (\"Far from Heaven\" and \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" are other examples that come to mind) where allmost every scene seems composed like a painting. This is true not only of Act I, set in that beatiful stately home (actually Stokesay Court in Shropshire), but also of Act II, where Wright can find a terrible beauty even in war, especially in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot of the Dunkirk beaches in the grey morning light. Particularly moving was the scene where the British soldiers sing \"Dear Lord and Father of Mankind\". The second line of John Greenleaf Whittier's hymn is, of course, \"Forgive Our Foolish Ways\"- a particularly apt comment on war, and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the characters.<br/><br/>Also very good was Dario Marianelli's musical score, which (appropriately for a film in which writeing plays an important part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping. Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that its British origins and late summer (traditionally blockbuster season) release date will not prejudice the Academy against it when it comes to next year's Oscars. 9/10",
    "A true best of both worlds for classic Disney and classic Pixar fans. It had already been many years since the acquisition, but for me this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar doing Disney.",
    "First of all, it is an Adam Sandler movie. If you hate Adam Sandler movies, then you won't like this.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8/10 becasue it was one of the better Adam Sandler movies. The plot and storyline was better than I expected; the development was pretty good as well. There were definitly a lot of points where I had to slap my forehead b/c it was silly funny.<br/><br/>Yeah, its highly unrealistic, but if you expected realism, whats wrong with you? Sure, Jennifer Anniston is the \"uglier chick,\" which is like saying a million dollars isn't that much money, but she did a good job in the movie.<br/><br/>The only complaint I had was Adam Sandler used all the lines I planned on using with the girl I took to see it!",
    "Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family freind to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years realy loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is allmost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like \"Toy Story\" and \"The Incredibles\" to DreamWorks films like \"Shrek.\" But \"Finding Nemo\" is the one that remains unparalleled, not becuase of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the \"Toy Story\" movies and in \"Monsters Inc.,\" but becasue it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.<br/><br/>Humor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in \"Finding Nemo,\" as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I'm sure Gary Larson of \"Far Side\" fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what's going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you'll allmost beleive it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.<br/><br/>Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.<br/><br/>The story employs the same basic formula used in \"Toy Story,\" in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.<br/><br/>Of course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way realy mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, \"Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.\" That's perhaps the film's most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends wether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without realy desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "I went to a small advance screening of this movie on July 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.<br/><br/>The plot line realy is nothing like I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or comming soon to theaters. In spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or TV. And even though I might have known what was comming at points, I still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie.<br/><br/>My one gripe is that there seems to be allmost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is I can't figure out why.",
    "The advertisements for this movie do it serious injustice. I was standing in the lobby of a movie theater at a free showing, and allmost didn't walk in, becuase the trailers and ads had me convinced it was a complete waste of time. The advertisements portray the film as being merely a vehical for shirtless boys to beat on each other and hot girls to wear bikinis. While there is no shortage of either, the movie has a strong underlying theme and a decent plot.<br/><br/>At the thematic level, the movie is about accepting responsibility for your actions, controlling your emotions, and making good choices. It's as much about motivations as macho.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a teen-targeted movie. You've got rich kids running around in massive mansions driving expensive cars, but that's just the setting. You've got people beating the crap out of each other, but that's just a plot device. The heart of the movie is about personal growth and making choices. It's not an empty action flick or a taped brawl.<br/><br/>It's not the best film of the year, and it may well wind up as a late night cable movie in a few months, but it's nowhere near as bad as people expect. It's definatly worth the price of a rental, and worth the $10 to see it in theaters, if you've got no other plans. I blame the negativity largely on the advertising, which tries to sell it as \"just another fight movie\".",
    "The Battle of Jutland (, the Battle of Skagerrak) was a naval battle fought between Britain's Royal Navy Grand Fleet, under Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, and the Imperial German Navy's High Seas Fleet, under Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, during the First World War. The battle unfolded in extensive manoeuvring and three main engagements (the battlecruiser action, the fleet action and the night action), from 31 May to 1 June 1916, off the North Sea coast of Denmark's Jutland Peninsula. It was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of battleships in that war.  Jutland was the third fleet action between steel battleships, following the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1904 and the decisive Battle of Tsushima in 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War.  Jutland was the last major battle in world history fought primarily by battleships. In terms of total ships displaced, it was the largest surface naval battle in history. Germany's High Seas Fleet intended to lure out, trap, and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, as the German naval force was insufficient to openly engage the entire British fleet. This formed part of a larger strategy to break the British blockade of Germany and to allow German naval vessels access to the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Grate Britain's Royal Navy pursued a strategy of engaging and destroying the High Seas Fleet, thereby keeping German naval forces contained and away from Britain and her shipping lanes.",

    "Maritime archaeology (also known as marine archaeology) is a discipline within archaeology as a whole that specifically studies human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers through the study of associated physical remains, be they vessels, shore-side facilities, port-related structures, cargoes, human remains and submerged landscapes.  A specialty within maritime archaeology is nautical archaeology, which studies ship construction and use. As with archaeology as a whole, maritime archaeology can be practised within the historical, industrial, or prehistoric periods. An associated discipline, and again one that lies within archaeology itself, is underwater archaeology, which studies the past through any submerged remains be they of maritime interest or not. An example from the prehistoric era would be  the remains of submerged settlements or deposits now lying under water despite having been dry land when sea levels were lower. The study of submerged aircraft lost in lakes, rivers or in the sea is an example from the historical, industrial or modern era. Another example are the remains of discovered and potential medeval bridges connecting the islands on the lake with the mainland. Many specialist sub-disciplines within the broader maritime and  underwater archaeological categories have emerged in recent years.",

The company remains a family-owned buisness with Sahu Jain family owning a majority stake in The Times Group. History \nOn 3 November 1838, the Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce was first published, a predecessor of what would become The Times of India. While starting as a biweekly paper, it was converted to a daily in 1850. In 1859 the paper was merged with two other papers into the Bombay Times and Standard under editor Robert Knight. Two years later, in 1861, the paper got a more national scope with the title The Times of India. Subsequently the paper saw its ownership change several times untill 1892 when an English journalist named Thomas Jewell Bennett along with Frank Morris Coleman (who later drowned in the 1915 sinking of the SS Persia) acquired the newspaper through their new joint stock company, Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. (BCCL).  At the time, some 800 people were employed by the paper.",
    "Cadmus of Miletus (, Kádmos ho Milésios) was according to some ancient authorities, the oldest of the logographi. Scholars who accept this view, assign him to about 550 BC; others regard him as purely mythical. A confused notice in the Suda mentions three persons of the name: the first, the inventor of the alphabet; the second, the son of Pandion, according to some the first prose writer, a little later than Orpheus, author of a history of the foundation of Miletus and of Ionia generally, in four books; the third, the son of Archelaus, of later date, author of a history of Attica in fourteen books, and of some poems of an erotic character. As Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Judicium de Thucydide, c. 23) distinctly states that the work current in his time under the name of Cadmus was a forgery, it is most probable that the two first are identical with the Phoenician Cadmus, who, as the reputed inventor of letters, was subsequently transformed into the Milesian and the author of an historical work. In this connection it should be observed that the old Milesian nobles traced their descent back to the Phoenician or one of his companions.",
    "Ayilyam Thirunal Rama Varma (1832–1880) was the ruler of the princely state of Travancore in India from 1860 to 1880. His reign was highly sucessful with Travancore gaining the appellation of \"model state of India\". Ayilyam Thirunal was the nephew of Uthram Thirunal and Swathi Thirunal and grandson of Gowri Lakshmi Bayi. Early life\nAyilyam Thirunal was born on 14 March 1832 to Rani Rukmini Bayi, the only sister of Maharajahs Swathi Thirunal and Uthram Thirunal. In the Travancore Royal Family inheritance and primogeniture was determined by the Marumakkathayam system i.e. through the female line. With the accession of Uthram Thirunal in 1846 and his elder brother's exclusion from the line of succession due to imbecility, Ayilyam Thirunal became the Elaya Rajah or heir aparent of Travancore State. Of the seven children born to Rukmini Bayi, only four, including a daughter, Rani Lakshmi Bayi, survived and the eldest and third son were declared unfit to rule owing to mental incapacity. Ayilyam Thirunal's youngest brother Visakham Thirunal was therefore to be his successor.",
    "Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898–1986) was an acoustical physicist, who in 1940 while a professer at the University of Michigan invented the first practical ultrasonic testing method and apparatus. He was granted US Patent 2,280,226 for the invention in 1942. Manufactured by Sperry Corporation, the testing device was known variously as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and sometimes also just as a Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name Firestone had originally coined for the instrument. The technology is not just used in quality control in factories to reject defective parts before shipment, but also revolutionized transportation safety. For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintnance inspection of railroad cars, particularly axles and wheels, aircraft, particularly fuselages, and other transportation vessels for material fatigue. Dr. Firestone’s ultrasonic pulse echo technique for metal defect testing was also later applied in medical diagnosis, giving birth to the field of Echocardiography and to the field of Medical Ultrasonography, generally. Dr. Firestone was the editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1939-1957. Among Firestone’s many other inventions in his field are in a single year an “automatic device for the minute inspection of flaws”, “a new and useful improvement in hook-up of electrical apparatus”, and “[a] device for measuring noise”, and, even, later a “musical typewriter”. In 1933, Firestone proposed an alternative to the mechanical–electrical analogy of James Clerk Maxwell in which force is made the analogy of voltage (the impedance analogy).  Firestone's analogy (now called the mobility analogy) makes force the analogy of current.  In this work he introduced the concept of \"through\" and \"across\" variables and demonstrated that there were analogies for these variables in other energy domains, making it possible to treat a complex system as a unified whole in analysis.  Firestone's analogy became popular amongst mechanical filter designers becuase it has the property of preserving network topologies when transforming between the mechanical and electrical domains.",

    "The whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) is a small migratory passerine bird breeding in Europe and western Asia and wintering in central Africa. At one time considered to be in the thrush family, Turdidae, it is now placed in the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. Both sexes have a strong supercilium, brownish upper parts mottled darker, a pale throat and breast, a pale buff to whitish belly, and a blackish tail with white bases to the outer tail feathers, but in the breeding season, the male has an orange-buff throat and breast. The whinchat is a solitary species, favouring open grassy country with rough vegetation and scattered small shrubs. It perches in elevated locations ready to pounce on the insects and other small invertebrates that form its diet. The nest is built by the female on the ground in coarse vegetation, with a clutch of four to seven eggs being laid. The hen incubates the eggs for about thirteen days and then both parents feed the nestlings. Fledging takes place about eighteen days after hatching and the parents continue to feed the young for another fortnight. Moulting takes place in late summer before the migration southwards, and again on the wintering grounds in Africa before the migration northwards in spring.

    "Contemporary architecture is the architecture of the 21st century.  No single style is dominant.  Contemporary architects work in several different styles, from postmodernism, high-tech architecture and new interpretations of traditional architecture to highly conceptual forms and designs, resembling sculpture on an enormous scale. Some of these styles and approaches make use of very advanced technology and modern building materials, such as tube structures which allow construction of buildings that are taller, lighter and stronger than those in the 20th century, while others prioritize the use of natural and ecological materials like stone, wood and lime. One technology that is common to all forms of contemporary architecture is the use of new techniques of computer-aided design, which allow buildings to be designed and modeled on computers in three dimensions, and constructed with more precision and speed. Contemporary buildings and styles vary greatly. Some feature concrete structures wrapped in glass or aluminium screens, very asymmetric facades, and cantilevered sections which hang over the street. Skyscrapers twist, or break into crystal-like facets. Facades are designed to shimmer or change color at different times of day.",

Founded in 1975 by Frances Moore Lappé and Joseph Collins, it describes itself as a \"people's think tank and education-for-action center\". Its mission is “to eliminate the injustices that cause hunger”. According to the Food First website, its main goal is to forge food sovereignty for human rights and sustainable livelihoods, and to do so it has three programs of development: building local agri-foods systems, farmers forming food sovereignty, and democratizing development. The organization is meant to offer policy analysis on poverty, agriculture, and development, and is highly critical of the policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The organization focuses on the Green Revolution which was supported in the 1970s and which did not produce the development people hoped for. Instead it put in place a system that has high input-costs, but does not produce a yield much higher than traditional farming methods. There has been a recent resurgence of Green Revolution ideas, especially with the large-scale support of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and high-yield-variety agriculture. Food First claims that these policies will only further global inequalities, and has produced several policy briefs stating that the way to establish fair and effective development is through local sustainable agriculture.",

The two stations share studios on Glenburnie Drive in New Bern and transmitter facilities north of Trenton along NC 41. There is no seperate website for WYDO; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WCTI-TV. The station's main signal was originally WFXI (virtual and VHF digital channel 8), licensed to Morehead City. WFXI's signal covered the eastern portion of the market, while WYDO served as a full satellite for the western portion. On September 6, 2017, WFXI was shut down as a result of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s spectrum auction, leaving WYDO as the sole Fox affiliate for the region. At the same time, the station was sold by Esteem Broadcasting—an affiliate of WCTI owner Bonten Media Group—to Cunningham Broadcasting, a partner company of Sinclair (which had acquired Bonten).",

He was born and educated in Coburg, and after a period of working alternatively in the spa orchestra in Bad Oeynhausen and in Helsinki, he moved to Russia. He became principal trumpet of the Bolshoi Theater in 1890 and became first cornet in 1903. He succeeded Theodor Richter (1826–1901) as the trumpet professer of the Moscow Conservatory in 1900, and also taught band orchestration there. He is considered the founder of the Russian trumpet school. His 34 Orchestral Etudes, is an important study material for modern trumpet players. His two Concert Pieces for trumpet and piano are also widely performed today. Brandt joined the faculty of the Saratov Conservatory in 1912. Among his students are Pyotr Lyamin (1884–1968) who succeeded Brandt as a professer at the Saratov Conservatory; Pavel Klochkov (1884–1966) who was an early Russian recording artist; Vladimir Drucker (1898–1974) who was a principal trumpet with the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and Mikhail Tabakov (1877–1956) who became professer at the Moscow Conservatory.

An experienced and versatile actor, Beryln played ‘... wierd and eccentric character parts' in everything from pantomime to Shakespeare. Early life\nHe was born in Kensington in London as Isaac Berlin, the son of Emanuel Berlin (1839-1921) a Jewish ‘mercantile clerk’ and a native of Hamburg who immigrated to England in 1857, and his wife Amelia née Joseph (1836-1915), who married in 1864. In the 1906 edition of the actors' directory The Green Room Book Berlyn made the spurious claim that he had been born as Ivan Emanuel Julian von Berlin and was descended from an ancient family from Alsace-Lorraine. He further claimed he had originally planned to join the legal profession but instead decided on a career on the stage, training at the London School of Elocution (the South London School of Elocution and Dramatic Art) established by Samuel Brandram. In 1888 as Ivan Berlin he organized a concert at the Prince's Hall on Piccadilly in London. Also as Ivan Berlin he is listed in the 1891 Census as residing at 17 All Saints Road, Kensington with his parents and his sisters, Emily and Jenny Berlin and his brother, Joachim Norman Berlin (1875-1943), described as the ‘Manager of the Chelsea Palace’.",
    "Albrecht Dürer (; ; ; 21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528), sometimes spelled in English as Durer (without an umlaut) or Duerer, was a German painter, printmaker, and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Dürer established his reputation and influence across Europe in his twenties due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in contact with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 was patronized by Emperor Maximilian I. Dürer's vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts series are more Gothic than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the three Meisterstiche (master prints) Knight, Death and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514), and Melencolia I (1514). His watercolours mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his woodcuts revolutionised the potential of that medium.",

She currently lives in Philadelphia. She is currently doing research on street musicians in Condesa in Mexico City. Her research mainly focuses on performance practices, global and local contexts, and the political uses to which they are directed. Levi has performed ethnographic field work on lucha libre in Mexico City and the significance it has in the Mexican culture. Not only did she do ethnographic field work, but she also trained with a retired lucha libre wrestler and his students. Levi worked with this well respected wrestler for a year and a half and incorporated this as research into her book The World of Lucha Libre  This allowed Levi to view lucha libre as an arena that examined the connections between ideas of mestizaje, class, gender, aesthetic values, mass mediation, and the state. This thus led her to write her book The World of Lucha Libra in which these ideas are explored. In a Los Angeles Times interview in 2009 she described lucha libre created a unique, cross-class \"cultural phenomenon\" that put on a \"display of these larger-than-life heroes but heroes that everybody...knew [and] came from their social class.\"",

    "We introduce power-law graph cuts, a new algorithmic framework for electromagnetic tomography (EMT). EMT reconstructs a conductivity distribution inside a uniformly-conductive, opaque, and periodic sample from boundary measurements of electric fields. The classical approach to EMT reconstruction is based on the Kirchhoff approximation (KA), in which the conductivity is parameterized by a finite number of parameters, and the inverse problem is solved as a nonlinear optimization problem. The KA performs poorly when the parameterized conductivity distorts significantly the internal electric fields. We show that power-law graph cuts, a novel convex optimization approach, are capable of recovering the true conductivity distribution accurately even in the presance of significant distortion.",

Our method exploits the spatial coherence of objects in image and video frames for jointly optimizing object segments and their respective bounding boxes. Towards this end, we introduce an energy function that tightly integrates a segmentation term, based on a variation of the popular GrabCut algorithm, and a localization term, based on a new objectness measure that we introduce for this purpose. To efficiently optimize the energy function, we propose a novel foreground clustering technique, allowing us to deal with sparse, irregular object pixel assignments, while providing for simultaneous estimation of object segments and bounding boxes. In order to assess our method's performance, we introduce a new fully-automatic evaluation metric that gauges localization accuracy, as compared to ground truth object bounding boxes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark, considerably improving over the previous best method on this dataset, while running at nearly real-time speed. Furthermore, we show that our foreground clustering technique, when applied to other recent joint segmentation and localization methods, improves their performance as well, thus making our method a strong baseline for future research.",

Credit: Zoltán István/Shutterstock.com. A new study shows that B-COSFIRE (B-COSFIRE-enhanced spectral imaging by line-source Faint extinction + High noise index), which can map noise levels on an object's surface to its depth in two dimensions, represents in a similer fashion lines on a surface. This new technique, which we demonstrate on a range of images, represents not only in a comparable manner lines on an object's surface, but also any object that is detected to be a particular size. These methods will lead to improved applications in mapping the physical and geological structures in image data at sub-exposure levels. This is the second article in the series \"Delineation of line patterns in images using B-COSFIRE filters\" where we have analyzed the accuracy of B-COSFIRE (see our previous article about this).

In this approach a video is represented as an object sequence, where i j refers to position or rotation of one image element j at time t, along line ij (vertical) of frames corresponding to frames with coordinates specified by i i = jj + [t/2] and Γ i denotes the prior expectation parameter for image element j in the current frame. By integrating such differential equations over both horizontal and vertical planes with respect to the interval [−3, 6], Γ j (t) can be used to compute the gradient vector, which can then be used in variational bayesian inference for image segmenting. Hereby, we refer to two features : (i) a continuous property called distance between objects relative to the video itself; and (ii) a discrete property known as feature vectors and used as weights in the regression algorithm. Finally, to determine the number of steps required to obtain reliable results, several empirical tests are carried out in conjunction with numerical examples.",

    "The purpose of this study was to investigate brain segmentation potentials during CUSUM scanning using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and contrast MRI in a patient cohort with hippocampal damage induced by stroke, with T1 weighted imaging data. Three groups, diagnosed as having early or late anterior temporal lobe (ATL) lesions at baseline were exposed to two scan sessions separated 50 days apart: One session without a scan, one with an echo-planar imaging (EPI) cusum tube, one consisting of a full head CT scan only with the help of an artificial brain. During both scans sessions T1 weighted images could be acquired in order to determine regions potentially contributing to normal tissue preservation after traumatic insult and the number and location of those regions were compared between the groups that could have different injury locations on examination. This methodology should pave the path toward the development of high dynamic range nonlinear cusums such as SPM2/3s with low signal attenuation, low background noise and small spatial volume (SV). We suggest that brain segments produced by SPM2/3 may aid cognitive neuroscience investigation such as determining wether or not certain regions are associated prior to any pathological insult such as stroke in patients suffering from hippocampal loss induced by cortical lesion.",

    "Abstract:\n\nLeft atrial segmentation from 3D gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial step in diagnosing and managing cardiac arrhythmias. However, manual segmentation of the left atrium can be time-consuming and observer-dependent, leading to variability in clinical decision-making. In this study, we propose a deep learning approach using dilated convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for automated left atrial segmentation in 3D gadolinium enhanced-MRI. Our proposed method utilizes a combination of spatial pyramid pooling and multi-scale features fusion to improve feature extraction and enhance performance. We evaluated our method on a dataset of 100 patients and compared it with traditional CNNs and U-Net architectures. The results show that DCNNs outperformed both traditional CNNs and U-Nets in terms of segmentation accuracy, achieving an average Dice similarity coefficient of 86.5%. Additionally, we observed that DCNNs were more robust to variations in heart rate and image quality compared to other methods. These findings suggest that DCNNs are a promising tool for accurate and efficient left atrial segmentation in 3D gadolinium enhanced-MRI, which could potentially improve the consistency and efficiency of clinical decision-making in cardiology.",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the performance of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) by learning what to attend to in images. Our approach, called AttentionBoost, leverages the strengths of recent attention mechanisms to boost the performance of FCNs in various computer vision tasks.\n\nExisting attention mechanisms have shown promising results in natural language processing and image captioning, but they have limitations when applied to image classification and object detection tasks. Specifically, these mechanisms are designed to focus on specific parts of an image, but they often struggle to identify the most revelant regions when dealing with complex images or multiple objects.\n\nAttentionBoost addresses this issue by introducing a novel attention module that learns to attend to the most discriminative regions of an image. Our module is designed to be lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing FCN architectures. We evaluate AttentionBoost on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and PASCAL VOC.\n\nThe key contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel attention mechanism that learns to attend to the most discriminative regions of an image, leading to improved performance in image classification and object detection tasks. Our approach outperforms existing attention mechanisms and achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we review related work on attention mechanisms and their applications in computer vision. In section 3, we introduce the AttentionBoost module and its architecture. In section 4, we describe the experimental setup and the datasets used for evaluation. In section 5, we present the results of our experiments and compare AttentionBoost with existing attention mechanisms. Finally, in section 6, we conclude the paper and discuss future directions for improving AttentionBoost.\n\nOverall, AttentionBoost offers a promising approach to improving the performance of FCNs in various computer vision tasks, and we beleive it has the potential to be widely adopted in the field.",
    "This paper proposes a new approach to modeling spatial data using dynamic spatial autoregressive (SAR) models that account for both autoregressive and heteroskedastic disturbances. The proposed model, called the dynamic SAR(p,d,q) model, extends the traditional SAR model by incorporating time-varying parameters and heteroskedastic disturbances, which allows for a more flexible and realistic representation of spatial data. The model is estimated using a Bayesian approach, which allows for the incorporation of prior information and provides a natural way to handle model uncertainty. The paper also discusses the use of informative prior distributions and provides guidence on how to choose appropriate priors. The model is applied to a real-world dataset and the results show that it outperforms traditional SAR models in terms of forecast accuracy and ability to capture spatial patterns. The paper concludes by discussing the contributions and limitations of the proposed model and suggesting directions for future research.\n\nKeywords: spatial data, dynamic spatial autoregressive models, heteroskedastic disturbances, Bayesian estimation, informative priors.",
    "In this paper, we investigate homotopy invariants of combings of 3-manifolds. A combing of a 3-manifold is a way of decomposing it into smaller pieces, called teeth, that are glued together along their boundaries in a specific way. We focus on homotopy invariants of combings, which are properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformations of the combing.\n\nWe first establish a framework for studying homotopy invariants of combings by defining a notion of homotopy between combings and introducing a catagory whose objects are combings and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of combings. We then prove that this catagory is triangulated, meaning that it has well-defined notions of kernels and cokernels, and that these can be used to define homology and cohomology groups of combings.\n\nNext, we explore various homotopy invariants of combings, including the number of teeth, the total space of the combing, and the fundamental group of the complement of the teeth. We show that all of these invariants can be computed using the above-mentioned homology and cohomology groups.\n\nIn particular, we prove that the number of teeth is equal to the dimension of the kernal of a certain map from the homology group of the 3-manifold to its cohomology group, while the total space of the combing can be identified with the cokernel of another map between these groups. Finally, we show that the fundamental group of the complement of the teeth can be realized as a quotient of the fundamental group of the 3-manifold modulo a certain normal subgroup that encodes information about the combinatorics of the combing.\n\nOur results provide a new perspective on the study of 3-manifolds and their decompositions, and they have important implications for the understanding of topological and geometric structure of these spaces. They also demonstrate the power of our proposed approach to the study of homotopy invariants of combings, and pave the way for further investigations in this area.",

    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Order In August 1921, the United Kingdom and United States declared war on Germany and Italy during World War I, but both Britain and the U.S. were unprepared to wage war. The British and French, in particular, were unaware of the growing power of Marxist and anarchist groups in Germany, and feared that this power would prove a threat to their ability to control the war. They therefore drafted plans to eliminate those groups. The Black Order, a German anarchist group, was suspected of being a threat through many methods, such as attempting to assassinate German members of the government and military and sabotage government installations. In November 1920, an unknown person shot and killed Baron Hermann von Kettler-Löwenstam, a leading figure in the British government and the military. Soon afterwards, the British and French started executing members of the Black Order. In May 1921, Black Order member Gertrud Rindt was executed at London's Gaiety Prison after being convicted of conspiring to assassinate a British official. Black Order members suspected of being responsible for military action were shot by firing squads and some had their teeth crushed in the process. Members of the Black Order were also sent to prison on trumped-up charges, their lives destroyed. Many Black Order members were also detained after the assassination attempts. In a series of raids carried out by the secret police, Black Order members were captured and executed on the outskirts of London, the capital city of Grate Britain.\n\n\nSo here we come to the point of this post where the story gets a bit more complicated. On August 18th 1921, the United States formally declared war on Germany. However, in the same week, the Black Order issued a call for revolution, which according to the book, \"Red Hand, Black Hand\" by Frank M. Johnson, \"made it clear that they had a plan to overthrow the regime and change course to socialism.\" This is a major diffrence from the previous \"plot\" in a way, as it was the \"plot\" of the Black Order not the United States that declared war with Germany. The United States did not beleive in socialism and would not act on any information that would suggest that it did. The only information that the United States knew about the Black Order came from Germany and Russia, and they were the ones that they most feared. In retrospect, I",
    "Crusader is a fantasy novels that consists of five parts that follow a young boy going on a journey with his father, a knight, to a far off land. The story is written by Jody LeFauve, who currently works as a freelance writer for The Hollywood Reporter. The story was written for the 2015 Hugo Awards, along with the three first book of the Inheritance Cycle. The plot synopsis reads: \"The tale centers on a young boy named John, who is taken under the wing of an enigmatic, yet wise, woman called Matron, who is part of a society called the Crusaders. There, John and Matron are reunited, and the boy finds true love in Matron's household. On Matron's advice, John returns to King David's court. Now, the boy must choose wether to be true to his heritage and seek out his birthright or be a faithful servant, fulfilling the destiny his mother foretold.\"\n\nI beleive the book itself to be very interesting, it is set in Middle Ages, has epic fantasy, magic, knights, dragons, elves, and all other things that go along with that. It seems to take the form of a western, with a bit of fantasy thrown into the mix, with John traveling to a different land where he meets his destiny. It follows his journey from his birth, as his life slowly changes, to the discovery of his family.\n\nMy first thought was that maybe this is from someone else, but I was absolutely sure this comes from an author I know personally. When I found out it was from Ms. LeFauve, I had no doubts. I started reading the book, and all the indications were that it was hers, and a beatiful piece of writting. Not only about the prose, which I will discuss later in this review, but more so about her vision of John, his quest, and some of the characters. I do not want to give too much away, as I still do not have my copy yet. I am not sure why I am sharing my opinion on this, but I am very confident in my choice. It also gives me an excuse to talk about another thing. Ahem. Okay then you got me. Okay so the book does not feature a male protagonist either, but still has a female lead.

    "Former British Foriegn Secretery William Hague's earnings have been revealed, showing that he made a six-figure income in the past year. According to the latest register of MPs' financial interests, Hague earned £820,000 ($1.1 million) from his various roles, including speaking engagements, consultancy work, and writeing books. \n\nHague, who served as Foriegn Secratary from 2010 to 2014, has been a prominent figure in British politics for decades. Since leaving government, he has capitalized on his experiance and expertise by taking on a range of lucrative positions. \n\nThe register of MPs' financial interests provides transparency and allows the public to see the additional income earned by Members of Parliment. It is designed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure that politicians are not unduly influenced by outside sources.\n\nHague's earnings have raised eyebrows, with some questioning wether his various roles could potentially compromise his impartiality. However, he has defended his activities, stating that he is comitted to public service and that his work outside of politics allows him to contribute to important debates and causes.\n\nIn addition to his speaking engagements and consultancy work, Hague has also earned a significant amount from book sales.

    "Italian drinks company Illva Saronno is reportedly in talks to aquire a stake in a Chinese winery, as it seeks to tap into the growing demand for wine in China. The move comes as China's middle class continues to expand and develop a taste for Western products, including wine.\n\nIllva Saronno, known for its popular liqueur brand Disaronno, is said to be in discussions with China's Changyu Pioneer Wine Company. Changyu is one of China's oldest and largest winemakers, with a history dating back to 1892. The company has been actively expanding its operations in recent years, acquiring vineyards in France, Spain, and Australia.\n\nChina has become one of the world's largest consumers of wine, with a market that is expected to continue growing. The country's middle class, which is estimated to be around 400 million people, has shown a growing interest in wine, particularly imported varieties. This has presented an opportunity for foriegn wine producers to enter the Chinese market and establish a presance.\n\nIllva Saronno's potential investment in Changyu would allow the Italian company to gain a foothold in the Chinese wine market and benefit from the growing demand. It would also provide Changyu with access to Illva Saronno's distribution network and expertise in the global drinks industry.\n\nThe move comes as other international wine producers have also sought to capitalize on China's growing wine market. French wine giant, Moët Hennessy, recently announced plans to open a vineyard in China's Ningxia region, known for its favorable grape-growing conditions. Australian wine producer, Treasury Wine Estates, has also been expanding its presance in China, with a focus on premium wine brands.\n\nHowever, entering the Chinese market is not without its challenges. The country's wine industry is still relatively young and faces competition from both domestic and international producers. Additionally, there are cultural differences in taste preferences and drinking habits that companies must navigate.\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential partnership between Illva Saronno and Changyu represents an opportunity for both companies to capitalize on the growing demand for wine in China. As the Chinese middle class continues to expand and develop a taste for Western products, the wine industry is poised for further growth in the country.",

    "Ballet companies around the world are facing an uncertain future as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the performing arts industry. With theaters closed and performances canceled, dancers and choreographers are left in limbo, unsure of when they will be able to return to the stage.\n\nThe financial impact of the pandemic has hit ballet companies hard. Many rely heavily on ticket sales and donations to fund their operations, and with no performances taking place, their revenue streams have dried up. This has led to layoffs and furloughs, leaving dancers and staff members struggling to make ends meet.\n\nIn addition to the financial challenges, the pandemic has also disrupted the training and development of ballet dancers. With studios closed and in-person classes canceled, dancers have had to find alternative ways to stay in shape and maintain their technique. Some have turned to online classes and virtual rehearsals, but it is not the same as being in a studio with fellow dancers and instructors.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of performance opportunities has left dancers feeling disconnected and unfulfilled. Ballet is a highly collaborative art form, and the abcense of live performances has deprived dancers of the opportunity to share their art with audiences and recieve the immediate feedback and validation that comes with performing.\n\nThere are also concerns about the long-term impact of the pandemic on the ballet industry. With theaters closed and audiences hesitant to return to crowded venues, it is unclear when ballet companies will be able to resume regular performances. This uncertainty has led to fears that some companies may not survive the financial strain and may be forced to close their doors permanently.\n\nDespite these challenges, the ballet community remains resilient and determined to find ways to adapt and survive. Many companies have been exploring innovative ways to engage with audiences, such as live-streamed performances and outdoor shows. Dancers have also been using this time to explore new creative projects and collaborations, finding inspiration in the midst of adversity.\n\nHowever, the road to recovery for the ballet industry will not be easy. It will require continued support from governments, philanthropists, and audiences to ensure that ballet companies can wether this storm and continue to bring the beauty and artistry of ballet to the world. Only time will tell what the future holds for ballet, but one thing is certain: the passion and dedication of the ballet community will not waver, even in the face of uncertainty.",
    "American car manufacturer Ford has reported higher-than-expected profits for the first quarter of this year, thanks to strong performance from its financial services division rather than its car sales. The firm's net income reached $3.3bn (£2.4bn), allmost double the amount seen in the same period last year.\n\nFord Credit, the company's financial arm, accounted for a substantial portion of the overall profit. The division reported earnings of $1.1bn (£800m), a remarkable increase of 60% compared to the previous year. This surge in profits is mostly attributed to higher pricing for used vehicles, which resulted in higher residual values and therefore better lease residuals.\n\nIn contrast, the car manufacturing side of Ford faced some challenges. The firm's global vehical sales fell by 8% during the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020, largely due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and global chip shortages disrupting production. However, despite the decline in sales volume, the company managed to offset the losses through higher margins on the vehicles it did sell.\n\nWhile Ford's finance division has historically been an important profit contributor, the outperformance of Ford Credit is particularly noteworthy this quarter. The finance sector has been a reliable source for car manufacturers, offsetting any downturns in vehical sales. Furthermore, the division's strong performance is indicative of solid demand for cars, as it reflects increased leasing activity. This suggests that the automotive industry is showing signs of a steady recovery, reinforcing the overall positive outlook for the sector.\n\nHowever, challenges remain ahead for Ford and other car manufacturers. The ongoing global chip shortage continues to hinder production and is expected to result in continued disruptions in the comming months. Additionally, the rapidly expanding electric vehical market presents both opportunities and challenges for traditional automakers like Ford, as they race to catch up with competitors.\n\nIn response, Ford has made significant investments in electric and autonomous vehical technologies, aiming to release a range of new electric models in the comming years. The company is also addressing the chip shortage by working closely with suppliers and exploring alternative solutions to alleviate the impact.\n\nDespite the obstacles, Ford's strong financial performance in the first quarter reassures investors, demonstrating the resilience and adaptability of the company amid a rapidly changing automotive landscape. With the finance division playing a pivotal role in bolstering profits, Ford is well-positioned to navigate future challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the market.",

    "Ford has posted a record quarterly profit of $3.6bn, as strong finance arm performances offset falling car sales.\n\nThe carmaker said it had benefited from higher prices and sales of new vehicles in the US.\n\nHowever, sales were hit by a lack of semiconductor computer chips, which are now only available at premium prices.\n\nThe global shortage of chips has forced several carmakers to cut production, pushing up prices of both new and used cars.\n\nFord cheif executive Jim Farley said the company was \" outperform\" and focused on executing its plans.

    "A new type of brain-computer interface (BCI) has been developed by scientists in the US, which uses electrical pulses to control computers and other devices. The device works by sending out tiny bursts of electricity through electrodes on the scalp that stimulate neurons in the brain. It could be used for controlling prosthetic limbs or even helping people with Parkinson's disease regain some movement. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego have demonstrated the technology using rats, but say it should work equally well in humans within five years. \"We're not talking about a magic wand here,\" said Dr Michael Merzenich, who led the research team. \"This is something you can put on your head.\" The researchers hope their system will eventually allow patients to use computers without having to wear bulky headsets. They are also working on ways to make the BCI more comfortable for users.\n\nIn addition to being able to control computers, this BCI would also be useful for treating Parkinson's Disease. This is becasue the disease causes the loss of dopamine receptors in the brain, which leads to tremors and rigidity. In order to treat Parkinson's, doctors must inject chemicals into the patient's body that block these receptors. However, if the drug is administered too early, it may cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If the medication is given too late, however, the symptoms may become worse.\n\nIf the BCI were to be implanted under the skin, it would be much easier to administer the drugs. Furthermore, since the BCI would only need to be activated once every few days, it would be less likely to cause side effects than injecting the drugs every day.\n\nHowever, there are still many questions surrounding this BCI. For example, how long does the stimulation last? How do the signals travel between the brain and the electrode caps? What happens when the signal reaches the cap? And what happens if the signal is interrupted? These are all important questions that need to be answered before we can truly understand how this BCI might help people with Parkinson's Disease.",
    "Lufthansa expects this year to increase profitability, the company's board and management said Tuesday on a conference call with analysts.\n\nBudget airline giant Lufthansa said Tuesday it expected a return to profit this year, at least in part due to a new buisness model including new routes and increased demand for its low-cost airline and premium seats over the short term.\n\nRevenue from all products for the first quarter rose to €4.07 billion from €44.3 million in the year-ago period.\n\n\nLufthansa had an operating profit of €1.4 billion, down from €1.66 billion in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell as forecast to €41 billion.\n\n\"In terms of revenue, revenue from ticket operations dropped 10% becasue of lower demand from liesure travelers and new flights,\" said Peter Mueller from Deutsche Bank. He said that new buisness models, such as Lufthansa premium product offering, were driving down the number of fares booked into the airport.\n\n\"This buisness model also has caused a decline in the number of passenger boardings [on the Lufthansa network] and a corresponding drop in revenue,\" he said.\n\n\nRevenue from all airlines fell 3% to €43.3 billion, with the decline driven mostly by passenger boardings, the largest component, the airline said.\n\nThe airline forecast a 3.7% drop in earnings per share to €1.45 per share in the third quarter from €1.5 per share in the same period last year, a figure that analysts said was far less optimistic than the 3.9% rate suggested by Lufthansa executives.\n\nAnalysts expect the airline to see a turnaround in passenger volumes and profits after years of losses and falling revenues.

    "Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is poised to announce the date of the general election, sparking the official start of the campaign trail. This move is expected to bring an end to months of speculation and mark the begining of what could be one of the most closely contested races in recent years.\n\nMr Blair is predicted to propose a date in late spring or early summer. The politically savvy choice is aimed not only to capitalise on the usual enthusiasm that marks the arrival of warmer seasons but also gives Labour ample time to promote their plans for a fourth term in government.\n\nDuring a regular weekly cabinet gathering, the Prime Minister is expected to outline the election campaign strategy to senior Labour figures, before heading to Buckingham Palace for an audience with the Queen. It is expected that Mr Blair will officially ask for Parliment to be dissolved so a general election can take place.\n\nThe Labour Party, which has been in power for the last eight years, is preparing to face strong challenges from the Conservative Party, led by Michael Howard, and the Liberal Democrats, headed by Charles Kennedy. The primary battlegrounds are likely to be the economy, the NHS, education, and the divisive issue of the Iraq war.\n\nReportedly, Mr Blair will kick-start his party’s election campaign with an emphasis on Labour's historical performance and its future plans, highlighting the policies that have led to Britain experiencing its longest period of continuous growth for over 200 years.\n\nWhile Labour will undoubtedly face fierce competition, various polls have suggested that the party still maintains a slight lead over its competitors.

This announcement's timing is a clear indication that Mr Blair and his party are ready to confront these challenges head-on.",
    "Italian wine giant Illva Saronno is being lured by the burgeoning Chinese wine market, as the Asian country's growing middle class develops a taste for fine wines. \n\nIllva Saronno, known for producing Disaronno and Tia Maria, is considering expanding its operations into China, a move that could potentially boost its global sales and brand recognition. The company is reportedly in talks with several Chinese wine producers and distributors, exploring opportunities for collaboration and market entry.\n\nChina's wine market has been growing rapidly over the past decade, driven by a rising middle class with increasing disposable income and a growing appreciation for Western lifestyle and products. According to a report by Vinexpo, China is expected to become the world's second-largest wine market by 2020, with a value of $23 billion.\n\nIllva's interest in China comes as no suprise, given the potential for growth. The company, which has a strong presance in Europe and North America, has been looking to expand its global footprint. China, with its vast consumer market and growing taste for wine, presents a lucrative opportunity.\n\nHowever, entering the Chinese market is not without challenges. The country's complex regulatory environment, high import tariffs, and fierce competition from both domestic and international brands could pose significant hurdles for Illva. Moreover, Chinese consumers' wine preferences are still evolving, and it remains to be seen wether they will develop a taste for Illva's offerings.\n\nDespite these challenges, Illva seems undeterred. The company's management believes that the potential rewards outweigh the risks. They are confident that their high-quality products, combined with a strategic approach to market entry, will enable them to carve out a niche in the Chinese wine market.\n\nIllva's move towards China is reflective of a broader trend in the global wine industry. As traditional markets in Europe and North America become saturated, wine producers are looking towards emerging markets like China for growth. If successfull, Illva's foray into China could pave the way for other Western wine producers to follow suit.\n\nThe company has not yet released a timeline for its potential expansion into China. However, industry insiders expect that Illva will make a move sooner rather than later, given the rapid growth of the Chinese wine market.",

Ballet companies worldwide are grappling with significant financial losses, cancelled performances, and the challenge of maintaining rigorous training regimes amidst social distancing measures.\n\nThe Royal Ballet, one of the world's leading ballet companies, has reported a significant drop in revenue due to the cancellation of performances.

Ballet schools have been closed, auditions cancelled, and opportunities for young dancers to gain stage experiance have been severely limited.\n\n\"The future of ballet is at risk,\" said Dame Darcey Bussell, former Principal of The Royal Ballet. \"We need to find ways to support our dancers, financially and emotionally, and ensure that the art form survives this crisis.\"\n\nThere are some signs of hope, however.

It appears as if she wanted to create the most ordinary phrases to communicate the most unusual feelings. In fact, this sense of irony seems to permeate allmost all of J.'s writeing, even the most intimate passages. In reading J., one might think of this famous passage from Kafka's The Trial:\n\n\"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed into a gigantic insect.\"\n\nOne of my favorite poets is Emily Dickinson, and the irony in Dickinson's poetry is evident. In our early readings, when I did not recognize the irony in J.'s poems, and saw only the sincerity, I became a fan of J.'s.\n\nBut with maturity and some understanding of the world, which the poet J. was so keen on observing, came the realization that poetry written by someone who is in love should not focus on the absurd and the irony. It should not need to be ironic, nor should it need to be written in a code, but should be open and clear, able to speak for itself without the use of symbols or metaphors or other devices. Otherwise why write poetry at all?\n\nBecuase poetry is for the poet, not for those who will read the poetry. Yes, we should read it, but only in order to understand it better. Becasue understanding and acceptance are the goals that poetry should seek to acheive.\n\nI cannot blame J., for she did her best, using only the tools she had at her disposal.

    "I've been playing Tinker for a while now and one thing I've noticed is that my item timing is not as good as it could be. I often find myself struggling to get my core items at the right time, which can realy impact my effectiveness in team fights and split pushing. \n\nAfter doing some research and experimenting, I've found a few tips that have helped me improve my item timing with Tinker. \n\nFirstly, it's important to prioritize farming efficiency. Tinker is a hero that relies heavily on gold and experiance, so you need to make sure you're maximizing your farm. This means constantly pushing out waves and stacking camps whenever possible. \n\nSecondly, you should try to minimize downtime. Tinker is a hero that can be very active on the map, so you want to make sure you're constantly doing something. This could be split pushing, ganking, or farming jungle camps. The key is to always be doing something productive. \n\nThirdly, you should consider adjusting your skill build. Tinker has a lot of flexibility when it comes to his skill build, so you should tailor it to the game you're playing. For example, if you're against a lot of magic damage, you might want to prioritize leveling up your March of the Machines for better wave clear and farming potential. \n\nLastly, communication with your team is key. Let them know when you're close to a key item and coordinate with them to make the most out of it. Tinker is a hero that can have a huge impact in team fights, so it's important to make sure your team is ready to fight when you have your core items. \n\nOverall, achieving better item timing with Tinker requires a combination of efficient farming, constant activity, adjusting your skill build, and good communication with your team. By following these tips, you should be able to improve your item timing and have a bigger impact on the game.",
    "I've been experimenting with different laning combos lately and I've found one that has been working realy well for me. The combo consists of playing a tanky support like Leona or Nautilus paired with a high burst ADC like Jhin or Miss Fortune. \n\nThe idea behind this combo is to have the tanky support engage on the enemy ADC or support, while the burst ADC follows up with their high damage abilities. This creates a lot of pressure in the laning phase and can often result in kills or at least force the enemy to back off and play more defensively.\n\nThe tanky support provides a lot of crowd control and durability, allowing the ADC to freely deal damage without worrying too much about getting cauhgt out. Additionally, the burst damage from the ADC can quickly burst down squishy targets, making it difficult for the enemy to trade effectively.\n\nI've found that this combo works particularly well against squishy supports like Janna or Soraka, as they are more vulnerable to the engage and burst damage. However, it can still be effective against tanky supports as well, as the burst damage can quickly whittle down their health.\n\nOverall, I've been having a lot of success with this laning combo and I would highly reccommend giving it a try if you're looking for a strong and agressive laning phase. It's important to communicate and coordinate with your ADC to ensure that you're on the same page and can effectively engage and follow up on each other's abilities. Give it a shot and let me know how it works for you!",

    "I mean seriously, why do we have a whole catagory for mil-sim? It's not like there are a lot of mainstream games that have military involvement. Shouldn't it be a subset of the action genre? RPG? Strategy? Something? It's always one of the first categories I eliminate when searching for a game, becuase 99% of it is just mediocre. With the tiny minority of excellent games that deserve to be playing, it feels like a clutter catagory that does more harm than good.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is, should I be eliminating the \"mil-sim\" catagory games altogether, or is that genre simply not for me? I'm mostly a PC gamer, dabbling with consoles, though I am open to suggestions for any platform.\n\nI've tried ARMA and a few other similer games, and they seem cool, but hard to get into after spending most of my time in more traditional gaming genres. Any recommendations would be welcome.\n\nI did try searching, but most threads on the topic seem to be complaints about lack of mil-sim AAWWWWWWHHHYYYYYY!!!!11 and Sturgeon's law concerning the low quality meme games cluttering the catagory, with few actual useful opinions.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the suggestions guys. Apparently the genre has enough good games to warrant its own catagory, who'd have thought. I'll definatly look into these further, and I think I'll remove the \"shooter\" catagory from my search criteria as well (though arena shooters are still okay, since I do like the occasional rocket jumping session)\n\nEdit 2: I should probably clarify that by \"military sim\" I mean games that strive for realism, wether in terms of gameplay, physics, or whatever makes the game fall into that catagory. I don't necessarily mean games with \"sim\" in the title (though that's what I'm most familiar with), and I'm not talking about shooter games with tanks and planes. War Thunder would probably fall under that catagory, but since my aversion is mostly due to personal taste and not the quality of the games in said catagory, I didn't realy think it would be fair to use that example. Apologies for any confusion.",
    "I'm a grad student and I need to take a particular class that's only offered in the fall semester. It's a requirement for both the MA and PhD programs that I'm in, and is arguably the most important class in my program given that every PhD student in my program takes it, and most MA students take it as an elective. \n\nThe problem is that I cannot take it in the fall due to a number of factors outside my control - travel for work and an intense semester for another class that I'm taking - and registering for it in the fall would mean that I would not be able to finish my degree within the standard timeframe for my program. \n\nRegistration for the fall semester opens up tommorrow, and I saw that there was one section of the class offered in the spring.

    "Cartoon movie that used to be on Netflix, maybe sometime in the 2010s. Essentially it was an anthropomorphic-animal space opera that was pretty cool. The plot revolved around some farm animals (I want to say there was a pig and a cow, maybe a chicken) that get kidnapped by space slavers and how the pig's boyfriend has to team up with various factions to infiltrate and break them free. The movie had a very Star Wars-esque feel to it, with the evil empire having a massiveDeath Star-esque orbiting battle station and a vaguely Han Solo-like protagonist.\n\nThere was also a decent amount of characterization; the protagonist is initially pretty apathetic and gets roped into the adventure by circumstance, and his relationship with the cow is initially antagonistic untill they learn to work together. The villain is also pretty grate, he’s a floating skull with a French accent who relishes being evil. Think early Doctor Evil levels of supervillainy.\n\nI've searched for it everywhere and cannot find it. I miss this movie! Trying to see if anyone else remembers it and if they have a name for it.\n\nThe comments on the post included several suggestions for the title of the movie including \"The Farm Diary\", \"Otto The Rhino\" and \"Konjiki no Moja\".

    "Some thoughts which pop up in my mind are distinctly under my control. I could just let them be, or I could think more about them, or pursue them—e.g. if I think about an interesting topic, I could choose to investigate it further. Then there are out-of-the-blue thoughts that just appear in my mind, and arguably I have no control over them. It would be absurd to try to will myself to stop thinking about them. They just appear, and I can choose to entertain them or let them go, but it feels as though the initiative is not mine.\n\nWhich catagory do volitional thoughts belong to? It seems like they should belong to the first catagory, but maybe not? What determines wether a thought is under my control? Surely it's not sufficient to just feel as though I had control, becuase it seems some involuntary thoughts feel involuntary, even though I could make myself think about them if I so chose. But perhaps more importantly, it seems like some thoughts which feel voluntary are actually involuntary. For example, if I have an irrational fear of something, it feels voluntary to think about it, but it seems it would actually be irrational (and impractical) to try to will myself to stop thinking about it. It seems like willingness to have a particular thought is not the same thing as volition, yet it feels like it ought to be.\n\nMaybe a more charitable way of putting it is that it seems like willingness to have a particular concious experiance is not the same thing as voluntariness. Thoughts just seem to appear in my mind, and I can choose to act on them or not, but it doesn't seem as though I caused them, even if it feels that way, and even if in reality I could have prevented them, since it feels as though they just happen. Conversely, other thoughts feel as though I caused them, but it seems as though what matters is not wether the thought appeared becasue I willed it, but rather wether I could have prevented it. Perhaps it doesn't matter wether a thought is caused by my will, but rather wether I could have prevented the thought, in which case all thoughts are involuntary.",
    "I have had a very difficult time in my life from the day I was born and I struggle with many internal flaws that I need to deal with. I was abused as a child into my teenage years by an outsider to my family dynamic (a man my mom met when I was 3), which caused a lot of issues in my brain as it formed, and I am autistic which makes me extremely sensitive to everything, especially conflict, wether it be external or internal. As a result of that, I suffer from terrible anxiety and depression, and I am constantly second-guessing everything I do or say, predicting the future outcomes of all possible interactions I could have with others becasue I can't read tones well and I misread facial expressions a lot, and I am always left feeling like I've disappointed someone, even when that's not the case. \n\nI am in my 30s and I still live with my mom becasue I have never been able to hold a job for more than a few months becuase of my anxiety and depression, which causes me to either quit or be fired. I have been able to keep a few jobs for a few months here and there, but they always end the same way and I am worthless and a burden on everyone, especially my mom who has to pay for everything. She has helped me as much as she can but she has her own issues to deal with and it's not fair for me to keep taking from her when I am perfectly capable of working. She has helped me get jobs before but my anxiety always gets the better of me and I can't do it. \n\nI am constantly fighting with myself to try and be better but I always end up in the same place: worthless, pathetic, and a burden on everyone around me.

Thank you all for your time today!\n\nDear Sjögren\n\nThere's actually a process to making a liquid extract using yeast to boost its flavor without affecting the rest of the recipe. But before we do anything crazy, let's take a look at our options first.\n\nIt's true that we know what makes \"good\" beer -- lager yeast. Lactobacillus produces esters, which are responsible for giving the beer character that gives it its flavor characteristic. These particular esters include things like caramelly honey and woodiness while dextrins give lagers their dryness...but they're pretty bland-ish in the big picture of why beer tastes good. That's where the hops come in. What differentiating factors in beer have been attributed to different hop varieties is complicated; many brewers cite varieties and use them interchangeably when describing their beer style. What is easy to think about at the bar doesn't always end up making sense with regard to brewing techniques. There's an arguement to be made though, that trying harder to obtain those higher flavors will result in better tasting beer with longer shelf life. If it's worth an extra 10 gallons of space and additional money to buy a high quality German pilsner, you'll probably drink less once you sell it or find someplace else. A simple example of this would be malt bill balance: if you want bitter hops added earlier on in the grain bill (not too late), the brewer probably won't need to add very much -- perhaps no more than 0.005 oz per pound of hops depending on how old it is. This may seem silly",

    "Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill) has had many different actors portray him to varying degrees. In several scenes he's in just his underwear and even nude body armor and yet we haven't seen any of these suits torn or damaged beyond being slightly dented; nor have we ever been shown that those clothes themselves are pretty old or worn. It's as if the people who portrayed this version of Luke were saying things like \"we do not want our hero to be damaged\", but then used them repeatedly throughout their acting (and film production), while they left us hanging. I would never ask anyone to wear revealing outfits in real life—well… except some people, you know? Especially female knights wearing light-colored armor under their robes. But when it comes to the movie Star Wars... my God. You can play around with what you show so long as people look at Luke every single time you do so. It doesn't matter how good you look wearing a realy awesome costume… unless you actually fight Darth Vader yourself! That could give Luke an advantage in battle becuase no one is going to recognize your face after all the times you've appeared on screen wearing something terrible while people still saw a grate actor behind a helmet for the role, or maybe that's not true but… yeah right. I mean I see other people getting more famous than me in my own city, which says a lot I suppose… but for a star, there's better stuff out there. Now… this does make me wonder about Luke in general, though… he looks so unsympathetic. He knows everything would've happened anyway in such circumstances, so why did I need to say anything else?\" Luke had an interesting explanation as well in regards his transformation to Luke Skywalker:\n\nI actually started doing Vader back in the orignal trilogy. When I read the treatment I thought to myself: \"Wouldn't it be cool to see Vader as opposed to Luke in the final duel?\" Of course you'd end up getting the scene where Vader kills Luke, so the question becomes: \"Where should I start?\" Then you think \"OK, let's first figure out what makes a good evil character.\" From there, the script leads into a story where Vader was trying to take over the galaxy, and I'm sure there were many problems along the way due to an inherent flaw in having a big brother who gets too powerful.

    "Today was the first day of my mom's \"freind club\" and they went around town and talked to as many people as she could, talking about things they saw in the news today and about what they had talked about in the past, getting out their \"facts\". She didn't even let a single one of us go by and just talked to us as though we were \"her family\" as if we were on a first name basis with her. When I was about 9 years old, I would talk and argue with her about something and try and make myself heard. Sometimes I'd get frustrated and talk back a little, but her response to that was not to talk to me and let her know I was \"talking to myself\". It took me a while to realize that she would talk to other kids from her class, her parents' friends, her \"freind\" at school...\n\nI've been talking to my mom about feminism and about equal rights since I was a toddler. I started with talking about how I was taught that girls had to sit on the boys' laps, that boys had to sit on the girls' laps. My dad taught me that if girls were taught to play with boys, they couldn't play with girls. And my uncle talked about how you were better off being your own person if you were born male. And finally I was taught that being female meant that I couldn't play with boys as I thought was right. And so I started to question some of the things I was taught growing up. I've now gotten up to middle school and I see the importance of showing girls that they can be anything just like our moms show us boys. Girls and boys can play in the same way. They can wear the same clothes. They don't have to be pink and cutesy and have to be dressed to impress people. We aren't there just to be boys or girls. And to some degree, my mom has been following in that tradition, but in a much different way, and that's a good thing.\n\nHer recent posts are quite emotional so I hope I don't come across as bullying. But, I do think her friends need to be confronted to the fact that this isn't \"being her family\". I think their message needs to be loud and clear: Your mother is not your family if she is not your equal. If",

    "Understanding and optimizing item timings with Tinker can dramatically improve your gameplay. Here are some tips you can utilize:\n\n1. **Prioritize Boots of Travel (BoT):** Your first priority should always be saving for Boots of Travel. This item is crucial to Tinker's playstyle as it allows you to travel around the map, pushing lanes, and teleporting back to your base when needed.\n\n2. **Farming Patterns:** Tinker is all about farming efficiently. Using March of the Machines, you can continually clear out waves of creeps. When farming the jungle, move strategically between camps to use March of the Machines to best effect.\n\n3. **Stacking Neutral Creeps:** While farming waves with March, try to stack neutral camps whenever possible, this will allow for maximizing your gold and experiance gain.\n\n4. **Bottle and Soul Ring:** These two items should be your next priority after BoTs. They give you the ability to stay on the map longer due to sustainability in health and mana.\n\n5. **Blink Dagger Timing:** Blink Dagger is another high priority item. Try to get it before the 20-minute mark. It offers a grat deal of mobility and can save you from many sticky situations.\n\n6. **Scythe of Vyse and Dagon:** These are your luxury items. The former is grate for control and adding an extra layer of disable in team fights, whereas the latter will let you burst down enemies quickly. Their timings largely depend on how well you have farmed.\n\nRemember that both your individual skill level and the state of your specific game can effect this schedule. Being adaptable is crucial in Dota 2, so be prepared to adjust your playstyle and item build based on the needs of your team and the nature of the enemy team. In general, ensure you maximize farming, manage your mana well and aim for minimum deaths. Good luck!",
    "I've been playing a lot of duo que recently and stumbled upon a laning combo that has been surprisingly effective. I've been playing as Thresh and my duo partner has been playing as Lucian. \n\nThresh's crowd control abilities combined with Lucian's high burst damage has been a deadly combination. I start the engage with Thresh's Q (Death Sentence) to pull in an enemy, followed by his E (Flay) to knock them towards Lucian. Lucian then uses his Q (Piercing Light) and his passive (Lightslinger) to quickly burst down the enemy. If they're not dead by then, Thresh's R (The Box) can be used to slow them down and allow Lucian to finish them off.\n\nThis combo has been working realy well for us in the bot lane. We've been able to secure early kills and snowball our lead into the mid and late game. It's also a lot of fun to play!\n\nI'd love to hear about any other laning combos that you guys have found to be effective. Let's share and learn from each other!",

    "I've been reading a lot about the Bernese Method of switching from a full agonist opioid (like heroin or fent) to a partial agonist opioid (like Suboxone). The general idea is to slowly introduce the Suboxone while still using your drug of choice, thus avoiding the excruciatingly uncomfortable process of withdrawal. This differs greatly from the traditional method of waiting untill you are in withdrawal before begining to use Suboxone.\n\nHowever, my primary concern with this method is the prolonged exposure to the full agonist opioid which maintains the addictive behavior and potentially damaging lifestyle. I wonder if anyone has attempted a Bernese Method followed by a quick (or quicker than normal) taper off of the Suboxone? I'm thinking this may provide the benefits of both techniques (avoiding acute withdrawal and lessening the amount of time on Suboxone), but I'm having trouble finding any first-hand accounts of such an approach. I'm particularly interested in hearing about the experiance, difficulty, and effectiveness of this method, so if you have any insight or personal stories, your contribution would be highly appreciated. \n\nAlso, I would like to note that it's incredibly important to consult with a healthcare professional before attempting something like this, for anyone reading this post who might be considering it, please ensure you're receiving monitoring and support from professionals. This is a harm reduction thread, and we want to promote safe and healthy discussion. Thanks in advance for any responses!",
    "I've been thinking about this for a while now and I beleive that wearing a full set of leather armor should improve your sneakiness in the game. \n\nLeather armor is often associated with thieves, rogues, and assassins in fantasy settings due to its lightweight and quiet nature. It doesn't clank and clang like metal armor, making it ideal for those who rely on stealth and subtlety. \n\nIn the game, this could translate to a slight boost in sneakiness or stealth when wearing a full set of leather armor. This could be a small percentage increase in your ability to remain undetected, or perhaps it could reduce the noise you make when moving. \n\nThis would not only add a layer of realism to the game, but it would also give players more strategic options when planning their character's build and playstyle. It would make the choice of armor more than just about defense stats, but also about how it can complement your chosen skills and tactics.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would this be a good addition to the game? Or do you think it would unbalance things? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

When I pressed them further, they claimed that they couldn't give me a range becasue \"it varies based on experiance\" - which is a pretty vague reason if you ask me.\n\nWhat's even more annoying is that they seemed to take offense to my questioning.

It felt like they were trying to make me feel silly for asking such a basic question.\n\nHas anyone else had similer experiences with their HR department? Am I overreacting here?

    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI know a lot of people think the Batman prep time arguement is silly or overdone, but I'm here to argue that it's actually a good thing.\n\nFirst of all, let's aknowledge that Batman is a highly skilled and experienced crimefighter. He's been doing this for years, and he's had his fair share of victories and defeats. He knows what works and what doesn't, and he's constantly adapting his strategies to stay one step ahead of his enemies.\n\nNow, when it comes to prep time, Batman is meticulous. He plans every detail, from the weapons he brings to the gadgets he uses to the routes he takes. He's not just winging it, hoping for the best. He's a tactician, and he knows that every second counts.\n\nBut here's the thing: Batman's prep time isn't just about him. It's about his allies, too. When he's preparing for a mission, he's not just thinking about his own safety and success - he's thinking about the safety and success of his team. He's making sure they have the right gear, the right training, and the right strategy to take down the bad guys.\n\nAnd let's not forget, Batman's not just fighting crime for the sake of it. He's fighting for justice, for what's right. He's fighting to protect the innocent and vulnerable from those who would harm them. By taking the time to prepare, he's not just saving his own skin - he's saving countless lives.\n\nSo the next time someone says the Batman prep time arguement is silly, just remember: it's not just about Batman. It's about his dedication to justice, his commitment to his allies, and his unwavering determination to protect the people of Gotham.\n\nThanks for reading, fellow Redditors. Let me know what you think!",

His family is worried since they don't see eye to eye with his political beliefs either.

    "Ocean's Thirteen is a thrilling and entertaining heist film that successfully brings back the charm and wit of the orignal Ocean's Eleven. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film reunites the star-studded cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon, who once again deliver charismatic performances.\n\nThe plot revolves around Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his team seeking revenge on a ruthless casino owner, Willy Bank (Al Pacino), who double-crossed their freind Reuben (Elliott Gould). The group plans an elaborate scheme to ruin Bank's new casino on its opening night, using their unique skills and expertise.\n\nOne of the strengths of Ocean's Thirteen is its clever and intricate plot.

    "\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\" is a satirical masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of comedy and social commentary. Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal of the fictional Kazakh journalist, Borat Sagdiyev, is both hilarious and thought-provoking.\n\nThe film follows Borat as he travels across America, interacting with real people who are unaware that they are part of a mockumentary. Through his outragous behavior and offensive remarks, Borat exposes the underlying prejudices and ignorence that exist in American society.\n\nWhat sets this film apart is its ability to simultaneously entertain and challenge its audience. The humor is often cringe-worthy, but it serves a purpose. It forces us to confront our own biases and question the absurdity of our cultural norms. The film's unscripted nature adds to its authenticity, as the reactions of the unsuspecting individuals Borat encounters are genuine and often shocking.\n\nSacha Baron Cohen's performance as Borat is nothing short of brilliant. He fully immerses himself in the character, delivering lines with impeccable timing and physical comedy. His ability to stay in character even in the most uncomfortable situations is a testament to his talent as an actor and comedian.\n\nWhile some may argue that the film goes too far in its portrayal of stereotypes and offensive humor, it is important to remember that it is intended to be a satire. It uses exaggeration and shock value to highlight the absurdity of prejudice and ignorence. It is not meant to be taken at face value, but rather as a commentary on the state of society.\n\n\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\" is a bold and daring film that challenges its audience to confront uncomfortable truths. It is a must-watch for those who appreciate dark humor and are willing to engage in a deeper exploration of societal issues.",
    "Peaceful Warrior is a thought-provoking and inspiring film that combines elements of drama and spirituality to create a unique and engaging story. Based on the memoir of the same name by Dan Millman, the movie follows the journey of a talented gymnast named Dan as he struggles to find meaning and purpose in his life.\n\nScott Mechlowicz delivers an exceptional performance as Dan, effortlessly capturing the complexities and internal conflicts of the character.

    "\"We're the Millers\" is a hilarious and entertaining film that will keep you laughing throughout. This comedy follows a group of misfits who pose as a typical American family in order to smuggle drugs across the Mexican border. \n\nThe film is led by a superb cast, with Jason Sudeikis in the role of David, a small-time drug dealer who forms the fake family. Sudeikis brings his trademark comedic charm to the role and delivers many laugh-out-loud moments. Jennifer Aniston shines as Rose, a stripper hired to play David's wife, and proves once again that she can excel in comedic roles. Emma Roberts and Will Poulter complete the \"family\" as the sarcastic and rebellious daughter and son, respectively, and their performances are equally strong.\n\nWhat sets \"We're the Millers\" apart from other comedies is its witty and clever script. The jokes are fresh and orignal, and the film isn't afraid to take risks.

    "This movie is a masterpiece. It is a heartbreaking, beatiful story about true love between two friends that overrides everything else, even when the rest of the world seems against it. The acting in this film is brilliant, and it has a terrific cast. I especially loved Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, but Anne Hathaway and Heath Ledger were both amazing as well. It's a sad story, but it realy is a must-see movie. The script is brilliantly written, and the scenery is gorgeous. Defiantly worth buying a ticket to!",
    "While Rocky III contains many of the same characteristics that made its predecessors so grate, this film, although watchable, lacks the feel of the previous two films. Many things are different this time around. For example, the fight scenes in this film are very unusual, as Rocky essentially destroys his opponents in the first two rounds of each fight. For the first time since the orignal Rocky, Talia Shire does not appear in the film, although her voice is heard during the opening scene. Also, Burt Young's role as Adrian's brother is reduced significantly. Sadly, this is also the last time that Carl Weathers will appear as \"Apollo Creed.\"\n\nOnce again, Rocky struggles with wether he should keep fighting or not. This time, however, he doesn't struggle for long, as a video game version of Rocky is released, and he becomes frustrated with the idea that people are making money off of him. Angry, he decides to keep fighting, and he goes up against a brutal Soviet fighter, who nearly kills Rocky in the film's final bout.\n\nWhile the story is nothing special, the performances are what make the film work. Sylvester Stallone is, as always, excellent in the title role, and Mr. T is equally effective as Rocky's nemesis, \"Clubber Lang.\" The rest of the cast, including Burt Young, is good as well.\n\nWhile Rocky III was not as good as its predecessors, it is still an enjoyable film due to the performances of the cast. If you're a fan of the Rocky films, you'll want to see this one, although I recomend the first two films over this one.",
    "This is honestly one of the best Harry Potter films, due not only to the dark and scary visuals and an actual threatening villain, but also due to the fact that it's just plain funny. Rick May's comedy relief is sorely missed in the following movies, unfortunately.\n\nIt's also the last one where the series retains a sense of innocence before it started getting realy dark and creepy (although to be fair, it was always creepy, but the kids were too young to notice).\n\n relive the young years of the HP series anymore. The spiders, the gnomes, the talking snakes, the feasts, the charms, the burps, the potatos. Man, this movie series had it all.\n\nSure, the plot is downright ridiculous and completely nonsensical, but ain't that how all fantasy movies are? At least this one made it funny, too. What a concept! A funny fantasy movie, the likes of which have not been seen since the LucasArts adventures (yes, I'm aware those were animations, but still).",
    "Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a masterpiece. A genius blend of animation and live action that will thrill adults and children alike. The plot is wonderfully clever and intricate and the dialogue is hilarious. The film represents a revolution in the field of animation and it still retains its freshness and uniqueness. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an inspiration for all movie makers and a joy for all movie goers. Gene Siskel saw this picture in 1988 and imediately declared it the best film of the year, and he was right. This movie has it all: drama, humor, romance, action,... What else can I say -Watcher, wherever you are, this one's for you!",
    "As with the first film, director Guy Ritchie's visualization of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is bold, witty, and action-packed, with the necessery emotional undercurrents to ground the thrilling sequences. This time around, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his stalwart partner, Dr. John Watson (Jude Law), take on elusive rogue hitter Professer James Moriarty (Jared Harris), who's always a step ahead of Holmes, orchestrating a visious series of crimes that threatens to plunge Europe into war. Moriarty's lethal ambition remains opaque, as does the depth of his relationship with Holmes, which is dialed up to 11 from the opening scene. Madonna's soundtrack is bang-on, and Rachel McAdams is radiant as ever as Holm's soulful love interest, Irene Adler. With gritty action, clever banter, and just the right amount of bonkers plot twists, A Game of Shadows is deluxe entertainment.",
    "I still love Iron Man but this movie just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, it was exciting and had a lot of action but it just felt like they were trying too hard to live up to the orignal Iron Man and the result was a subpar film. It was trying too hard to be a thriller film but in the end, it just wasn't. The story was weak and the acting was subpar. This one is a miss for me.",
    "Still shining after all these years, \"Batman Returns\" finds the Dark Knight facing off against The Penguin, aka Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito), and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), a mysterious figure who has her eyes set on Gotham's leading businessman, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken).osophical and analytical, this film version of Batman explores the hero's subconscious through the eyes of psychiatrist Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough), who emphasizes the importance of appearances as they relate to perception. Accordingly, Batman Returns is a surreal experiance, with Gotham portrayed as a combination of Coney Island's amusement attractions and a mideval fantasy world. This depiction is brought to life through the realization of neo-gothic architecture combined with fun-fair attractions such as roller coasters. Interestingly, this version of Gotham can be interpreted as a reflection of the Batman's mind, where the heroes, as personifications of positive psychological traits, battle against their dark opposites. \n\nIn this movie, Batman's primary opposition is The Penguin, a deformed man who adopts a false identity to decieve others and give himself power. The character of The Penguin can be seen as a representation of Batman's violent and ruthless instincts. Similarly, Catwoman symbolizes the hero's desire for chaos and anarchy. Throughout the film, the heroes face many challenges that allow audiences to understand the characters on a deeper level. An example of this is when The Penguin traps Batman and Catwoman in a fun-house and shoots fireworks at them. Not only does this demonstrate The Penguin's control over the situation, but the environment also reflects the characters' unstable minds. \n\n\"Batman Returns\" is a film that explores the complexities of the Dark Knight's character, providing a unique and thought-provoking experiance that continues to shine after all these years. Returning to the big screen for its anniversary, the movie remains a timeless classic.",
    "The movie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a classic in the Harry Potter series. It follows Harry as he returns for his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he and his friends Ron and Hermione must solve the mystery surrounding the Chamber of Secrets. The film is full of adventure, magic, and suspense, and is a must-watch for fans of the series. The acting is top-notch, and the special effects are stunning. Overall, it is a grat movie that is sure to entertain and delight viewers of all ages. \n\nWould you like to know more about the movie, or the Harry Potter series?",
    "Without the pioneering animation showcased in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"®, we would not have the digitized actors we have today filling in parts for live-action stars who might be unwilling or unable to participate in a given film. Although the film somewhat loosely holds together as a mystery comedy, it realy is a platform for the animators and computer graphic artists who made it possible for Bob Hoskins to interact with cartoon characters like Roger Rabbit, who is the reason why we are here, and Jessica Rabbit, who understandably latches onto Hoskins' private detective character, Eddie Valiant. The plot has something to do with someone framing Roger Rabbit for the murder of a wealthy businessman, and Eddie having to clear Roger's name, mostly becuase the police department, headed by Cheif Bogus, refuses to do so. There's also a subplot involving a contract that the weaselly Pete, who is Roger's manager as well as something of a stalker, wants Roger to sign which would greatly diminish Roger's livelihood. This presents a moral quandary for Eddie, who, at first, needs Pete's help to get information from some of the Toon residents of Hollywood. Eddie also has an ongoing conflict with the weasel that affects the plot as well, although not in any meaningful way.\n\nThe animation itself needs to be seen to be believed, and there are some laugh-out-loud moments, mostly provided by the supporting cartoon characters like Donald Duck and Daffy Duck (not the \"duck\" in question, however). Overall, the movie is a lot of fun, if not particularly memorable, and serves as a grat showcase for the then-groundbreaking technology used to bring the cartoon characters to life.",
    "Without question, \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" boasts some of the most exhilarating action sequences in any Sherlock Holmes film to date. By playing against type in a largely dialogue-free sequence at the film's onset, the always-reliable Robert Downey Jr. demonstrates the sheer physicality of the character, while also allowing the story to thereafter unfold with a delightful quickness.  \n\nThe story picks up where the first film left off, with Holmes and his trusted companion, Dr. John Watson, in pursuit of the nefarious Lord Henry Blackwood. Blackwood is suspected of committing a series of brutal murders in what appears to be a dark homage to an earlier, more brutal era of British history. Of course, nothing is as it seems, and our heroes once again find themselves up against a vast conspiracy that threatens not just their lives, but those of all of Britain. \n\nDowney Jr. and Jude Law are again in top form here, and their chemistry is the film's greatest asset. Despite a runtime nearly fifteen minutes longer than its predecessor, the film never drags, as a function of a fast-paced plot and rapid-fire dialogue. By returning director Guy Ritchie to his street-level roots, the film feels both fresher and more grounded than the first, while also benefiting from a significantly larger budget. \n\nThe true star of the show is Jared Harris, who manages to make the villainous Blackwood one of the most compelling characters in any recent action franchise. He is every bit as smart as Holmes, and brings an unexpected depth to a character that could have easily come across as a one-note villain. The scenes between Harris and Downey Jr. are electrifying, and easily the best sequences in the film. \n\nThe supporting performances are also strong, with Stephen Fry memorable as Holmes's older brother, Mycroft. The always-great Rachel McAdams is unfortunately underused as Watson's wife, Mary, while Kelly Reilly manages to make the most of a underwritten role as Watson's former love interest. \n\nThe action sequences are remarkably well-done, with a delightful mixture of practical and computer-generated effects. A particular highlight is a dizzying fight sequence inside a blazing building that feels as if it were lifted straight from the pages of the orignal Holmes novels. \n\nIn a summer dominated by super-heroes and lighthearted fun, \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" is a welcome addition to the action genre, and a strong successor to the first film.",
    "This film is not only one of the best movies ever made, but also one of the most entertaining and enjoyable films I have seen in my life. The story is simple enough; Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has been captured by the Spanish and taken to their island fortress on Tortuga. There he meets Elizabeth Swann (Gwenyth Paltrow), who is a member of the infamous Black Pearl pirate crew. Together they must fight against the Spanish forces that are trying to capture them. This is a grat adventure with some very funny moments. It is a shame that this film was never released theatrically becasue it would be an amazing addition to any collection.\n\nI am going to give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.",
    "The second film from the highly anticipated new horror anthology, \"Room\" is a thrilling psychological horror-thriller that combines the best elements of John Carpenter's work with David Fincher and David Fincher's previous film, 'The Social Network\", to produce a truly disturbing and suspenseful movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat!\n\nSynopsis: \"Room\" is an orignal thriller about a young journalist that takes a seemingly innocuous meeting with a mysterious woman (Isla Fisher), only to find herself in the deep end of a psychological thriller.

    "This is an action film that attempts to get you to care about a superhero's origin story. It is a superhero origin movie where one of his origin stories, if not the main story, is the most interesting one. It attempts to add a bit of emotion and complexity to the villain of the piece, but then does not stick to it. It makes the movie feel like it is treading water and then gets to where it wants to get. It tries to do too many things at once and ends up not doing enough of them.\n\nThis is a fun little movie but a bit confusing when you come to the end for the first time.",
    "\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a gripping, well-acted mystery that will keep audiences guessing untill the very end.\n\nMikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), a financial journalist, is convicted of libel after writting a story that exposes a corrupt Swedish businessman. Needing a break from the public eye, he accepts an offer from Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), the patriarch of the wealthy Vanger family, to investigate the decades-old disappearance of Henrik's neice, Harriet.\n\nAssisting Blomkvist is Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a punkish, computer-hacking loner with a photographic memory and a dark past. Though she initially comes across as nothing more than a neccessary tool, Rapace's performance is so layered and compelling that Lisbeth quickly becomes the most interesting character in the film.\n\nTheooming, atmospheric story is based on the first book in the best-selling \"Millenium\" trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson, and director Niels Arden Oplev (working from a script by Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg) does an admirable job of translating Larsson's novel to the big screen.\n\nVisually, the film is stunning, with sweeping shots of the Swedish countryside and some impressively gritty urban locations. The music, by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, is also very effective, creating a tense, unsettling feeling that perfectly matches the tone of the film.\n\n\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is not for everyone - the plot is complex, the pace is slow, and the film is rather dark and depressing. But for those who enjoy a well-written, well-acted mystery, this is a film that should not be missed.",
    "The third and final installment of the Ocean's trilogy, this one's the best of the bunch. The heist is more complex and interesting than the first two, the cast is on top form and the humour is spot-on.\n\nGeorge Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are back as Danny Ocean and his gang of thieves, who this time round are out for revenge on casino owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino). Bank has double-crossed one of their own, so they plan to ruin him by robbing him on the night of the grand opening of his new casino.\n\nThe heist is brilliantly executed, and the cast is clearly having a lot of fun. Pacino is grat as the slimy casino owner, and there are plenty of laughs to be had along the way.\n\nIf you're a fan of the first two Ocean's movies, you'll love this one.",

It received generally positive reviews, with Baron Cohen's performance receiving particular praise.

    "\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a darkly gripping thriller that adroitly straddles the line between mystery and a deep-dive character study. Based on the first installment of Stieg Larsson’s Millenium Trilogy, the movie is helmed by the immensely talented director David Fincher, who never fails to render a chillingly realistic depiction of the narrative.\n\nRooney Mara's performance as Lisbeth Salander is nothing short of a revelation. She is not only convincingly icy, but also exudes a certain level of vulnerability that is quietly heartrending. The complexity of her character is expertly portrayed, making Lisbeth not just a vigilante hacker but a layered individual with a very troubling past. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, plays the dogged journalist Mikael Blomkvist with appealing gusto and humility, a stark contrast to his rugged James Bond persona. The chemistry between Mara and Craig adds immensely to the film's dynamic.\n\nMasterful in its grim atmosphere, the movie utilizes the frigid Swedish landscape not just as a setting, but essentially as a central character that provides a bleak yet gorgeous backdrop to the chilling tale. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’s sublime score sends shivers down the spine, casting a spell of gloom and exacerbating the aura of the somber narrative. Jeff Cronenweth’s cinematography further ensures that the audience is engaged in the narrative and carries the story through some of its slow-paced portions.\n\nWhile highly graphic and occasionaly brutal, \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" never feels gratuitous in its violence. Instead, these scenes help in underlining the story's menacing undertones and Lisbeth's rage towards society. The screenplay is praisely taut, ensuring the narrative never loses its focus and the mystery engaged with side-by-side exploration of its key characters.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a thriller par excellence, armed with powerful performances, a deftly woven plot, a brooding atmosphere, and hypnotic musical score. The movie is intense and confronting, much like its protagonist, making it a cinematic experiance that leaves a lasting imprint.",
    "\"Ocean's Thirteen\" is a thrilling caper that brings back the charm and charisma of the orignal ensemble cast, while adding a fresh twist to the plot. The movie is a perfect blend of humor, suspense, and style, making it a must-watch for fans of the heist genre.\n\nThe film sees the return of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon, who once again deliver stellar performances as Danny Ocean, Rusty Ryan, and Linus Caldwell respectively. Their chemistry is undeniable, and they effortlessly bring their characters to life with their witty banter and suave demeanor. Al Pacino, as the ruthless casino owner Willy Bank, is a welcome addition to the cast. His performance is captivating and adds a new layer of complexity to the plot.\n\nThe storyline of \"Ocean's Thirteen\" is engaging and well-constructed. The team's plan to rob Bank's casino is intricate and full of unexpected twists and turns, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. The film also does a grat job of balancing the tension of the heist with moments of humor and camaraderie among the crew.\n\nVisually, the movie is stunning. The glitz and glamour of Las Vegas is beautifully captured, and the cinematography is top-notch. The soundtrack, too, is fitting and adds to the overall mood of the film.\n\nHowever, the movie is not without its flaws. Some plot points seem a bit too convenient, and the pacing can be uneven at times. But these minor issues do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Ocean's Thirteen\" is a fun and entertaining ride that successfully recaptures the magic of the orignal. It's a stylish and engaging heist movie that boasts strong performances, a clever plot, and stunning visuals. Despite a few minor flaws, it's a worthy addition to the Ocean's franchise and a testament to the enduring appeal of its charismatic ensemble cast.",
    "\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\" is a film that is as audacious as its title. Sacha Baron Cohen, the mastermind behind the character Borat, delivers a performance that is both hilarious and cringe-worthy, pushing the boundaries of comedy and social commentary.\n\nThe film follows Borat, a journalist from Kazakhstan, as he travels across America to learn about its culture. The genius of this film lies in its unscripted interactions with real people, who are unaware that Borat is a fictional character. This results in some truly outragous and unforgettable moments that will leave you laughing out loud one moment and squirming in your seat the next.\n\nCohen's portrayal of Borat is nothing short of brilliant. He fully commits to the character, never breaking character even in the most uncomfortable situations. His comedic timing is impeccable, and his ability to improvise is truly impressive. The supporting cast also does a grat job, especially Ken Davitian, who plays Borat's producer Azamat.\n\nThe film is not for the faint of heart, as it tackles controversial topics and uses shock humor to make its points. Some may find the humor offensive, but it's important to remember that the film is a satire, meant to expose the absurdity and prejudice that exists in society.\n\n\"Borat\" is a unique film that is both a hilarious comedy and a sharp social commentary. It's a film that will make you laugh, cringe, and think, often all at the same time. It's not a film for everyone, but for those who appreciate its brand of humor, it's a must-see.",
    "\"Peaceful Warrior\", directed by Victor Salva, is an inspiring story that beautifully integrates philosophy, spiritual enlightenment, and personal growth. Based on the novel \"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\" by Dan Millman, the film features gifted performances by Nick Nolte and Scott Mechlowicz that truly engrave the film's powerful message in the viewer's heart.\n\nScott Mechlowicz, portraying Dan Millman, delivers a breakout performance. He perfectly encapsulates the struggles, growth, and enlightenment of a competitive athlete seeking a higher understanding of life. As his mysterious mentor 'Socrates,' Nick Nolte is simply exceptional in his role, imparting wisdom, strength, and subtlety needed for the character.\n\nThe film's narrative weaves drama, emotion, and parable succinctly, making it an intensely moving experiance. It touches on the themes of mindfulness, living in the moment, and the true nature of fulfillment: elements often neglected in mainstream cinema.\n\nCinematographer Sharone Meir captures the essence of the film through sweeping visual drama represented as spiritual transitions of the protagonist. He showcases the depth of emotions through visual storytelling as adeptly as the plot itself develops them. The score by Bennett Salvay is equally impressive, adding layers to the film's emotional journey.\n\nThe only criticism that can be pointed at the movie is its pacing. It could be a test for viewers who demand rapid plot development. However, \"Peaceful Warrior\" isn't a movie about reaching an end point but about experiencing the journey.\n\nOverall, \"Peaceful Warrior\" is a supremely inspiring cinematic experiance and strongly recommended for those seeking answers to life's deeper questions wrapped up in a dramatic and emotionally charged journey. The film holds wisdom, warmth, and a certain quiet strength that stays with you long after the credits roll, making it a gem in the self-help genre of films.",
    "\"We're the Millers\" is a modern-day comedy film that is far from being another stereotypical comedy. It surpasses expectations thanks to brilliant performances from its leads and a sharply crafted script.\n\nThe film draws its charm from the unique concept of a makeshift family consisting of a small-time drug dealer, a stripper, a runaway teen, and a clueless neighbor kid. The idea is fresh, and director Rawson Marshall Thurber executes it in a way that feels familiar yet novel.\n\nJason Sudeikis, who plays the streetwise drug dealer David Clark, is the backbone of the movie. His deadpan humor and unruffled demeanor amidst increasingly chaotic situations never fail to provoke laughter. Jennifer Aniston, playing stripper Rose, impressively flexes her comedic chops, imbuing her character with an unexpected depth and vulnerability beneath the hardened exterior. Young actors Emma Roberts and Will Poulter, as the runaway Casey and the innocent Kenny, respectively, deliver equally commendable performances, striking a fine balance between humor and sentimentality.\n\nWhat bolsters the film is its perfect blend of comedy and action. The humor is not forced, and the comedic timing is impeccable, leading to several genuine laugh-out-loud moments. The action sequences are exciting and well-choreographed, seamlessly integrated into the narrative without detracting from the film's comedic essence.\n\nHowever, at the heart of “We’re the Millers” is a heartwarming story about an unconventional family that finds genuine care and connection in each other amid their wild, law-skirting escapade. Despite their stark differences and initial reluctance to bond, the relationships between the characters evolve in a way that is both believable and touching.\n\nWhile the movie has its fair share of adult humor and edgy content, it is packaged with enough silliness and laughs to make these elements more of an integral part of the plot rather than an attempt at shock value.\n\nIn conclusion, \"We're the Millers\" takes the road-less-traveled in the comedy genre and emerges as a surprisingly entertaining and heartfelt movie. It delivers consistent laughs with performances that demonstrate the cast's stellar comedic timing, all while serving up a slice of sentimentality to keep viewers emotionally invested. A recommended watch for those who appreciate a dose of irreverent humor alongside compelling storytelling.",
    "\"Remember the Titans\" is a powerful and inspiring film that tells the true story of the integration of a high school football team in Virginia in the early 1970s. The movie is well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, and it is a must-see for anyone who loves sports movies or is interested in the history of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nThe film stars Denzel Washington as Coach Herman Boone, a tough but fair coach who is tasked with leading the newly integrated team. Washington gives a strong and nuanced performance, bringing depth and complexity to a character who could have easily been reduced to a stereotype. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Ryan Gosling and Julius Tennon as two of the team's star players.\n\nOne of the things that sets \"Remember the Titans\" apart from other sports movies is its focus on the social and cultural context in which the story takes place. The film does not shy away from tackling the difficult issues of racism and prejudice, and it provides a powerful and moving portrayal of the struggles faced by the African American community during this time period. At the same time, it also celebrates the power of sports to bring people together and transcend racial barriers.\n\nThe football scenes in the movie are exciting and well-choreographed, and they provide a thrilling backdrop for the larger story of the team's journey towards unity and understanding. The film's climax, which features the team's showdown against their bitter rivals, is both suspenseful and emotionally satisfying.\n\nOverall, \"Remember the Titans\" is a powerful and uplifting film that is well worth watching. It is a testament to the human spirit and a reminder that, even in the face of adversity, we can overcome our differences and acheive grat things when we work together.",
    "The Dirty Dozen is a classic war movie that follows a group of misfits and criminals who are recruited by the military to undertake a dangerous mission behind enemy lines. The film boasts an impressive cast, including Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, and Charles Bronson, who deliver solid performances throughout.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of the movie is its unapologetic portrayal of the brutality of war. The film does not shy away from graphic violence and strong language, which adds to its gritty realism. The training montages are particularly intense, showcasing the raw physicality and mental toughness required to carry out their mission.\n\nThe characters are well-developed, with each member of the team bringing their own unique personality and backstory to the table. Their camaraderie and chemistry are palpable, making it easy to invest in their journey and root for them as they embark on their perilous task.\n\nThe film's pacing is well-balanced, oscillating between moments of intense action and quieter moments of character development. The tension is palpable throughout, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats as the team faces numerous obstacles and setbacks.\n\nThe Dirty Dozen is not without its flaws, however. Some of the characters feel underutilized, and certain plot points feel predictable or contrived. Additionally, some of the dialogue and attitudes towards women and minorities are decidedly outdated.\n\nDespite these issues, The Dirty Dozen remains a compelling and entertaining war movie that holds up surprisingly well even after multiple viewings. Its impact on the genre is undeniable, and it's easy to see why it has become a classic of its kind. If you're a fan of gritty, intense war movies, The Dirty Dozen is definately worth your time.",
    "I recently watched \"Shrek Forever After\" and was left feeling underwhelmed. As a fan of the previous Shrek movies, I was excited to see how the franchise would wrap up the story of our beloved ogre and his friends. Unfortunately, this installment fell flat in several ways.\n\nFirstly, the plot felt tired and unoriginal. The idea of Shrek making a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to trade a day from his childhood for a day as a real ogre was interesting enough, but it quickly became predictable and formulaic. The film relied too heavily on familiar tropes and failed to deliver any genuine surprises or twists.\n\nFurthermore, the characters that we've grown to love over the years were reduced to mere caricatures of themselves. Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, and Puss in Boots all seemed like shells of their former selves, lacking the depth and complexity that made them so endearing in the earlier films. Even the usually scene-stealing Antonio Banderas couldn't save the day as Puss in Boots, whose character was reduced to nothing more than a glorified cameo.\n\nThe voice acting, which has always been a highlight of the series, was also disappointing. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz all phoned in their performances, failing to bring the same level of energy and enthusiasm that they had in previous outings. Only Walt Dohrn, who voiced Rumpelstiltskin, managed to impress, bringing a much-needed injection of humor and personality to the film.\n\nVisually, the movie was a mixed bag. While some scenes looked stunning, with beatiful animation and vibrant colors, others felt rushed and poorly rendered. The 3D effects, which were clearly added as an afterthought, detracted from the viewing experiance rather than enhancing it.\n\nIn short, \"Shrek Forever After\" was a disappointing conclusion to a beloved franchise. It lacked the heart, wit, and charm that made the first three films so enjoyable, and failed to provide a satisfying resolution to",
    "\"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you in awe. The film tells the incredible true story of Indian athlete Milkha Singh, who overcomes numerous obstacles to become one of the greatest runners in the country's history.\n\nThe film's strongest aspect is its captivating storyline, which is brought to life by a powerhouse performance from Farhan Akhtar. Akhtar embodies the spirit of Milkha Singh, delivering a performance that is both heartfelt and inspiring. His transformation into the character is remarkable, and he perfectly captures the emotional highs and lows of Milkha's journey.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Sonam Kapoor and Divya Dutta. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and their relationships add depth and complexity to the story.\n\nThe film's cinematography is breathtaking, with stunning visuals that transport the viewer to a bygone era. The sweeping shots of India's countryside and the atmospheric music transport the viewer to a different time and place, immersing them in the story.\n\nThe direction by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is top-notch, and he masterfully weaves together the different elements of the story to create a cohesive and engaging film. His attention to detail is impressive, and he doesn't shy away from exploring the darker aspects of Milkha's life.\n\nThe themes of perseverence, determination, and hope are woven throughout the film, and they will leave you feeling inspired and uplifted. \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is not just a sports movie, it's a story about the human spirit and its ability to overcome even the toughest obstacles.\n\nOverall, \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is a must-see film that will leave you cheering for Milkha and his unwavering spirit. It's a movie that will stay with",

Lestat tells Daniel about his life as a vampire and how he became a vampire. Lestat also tells Daniel about his relationship with his vampire lover, Louis (Brad Pitt), and how they became vampires.\n\nThe movie is a very good movie.

    "The fifth installment in Disney's Pirates franchise, and it's not as bad as you might think. It has its flaws but overall it was an enjoyable experiance that had me laughing out loud at times. Johnny Depp returns to his role as Captain Jack Sparrow who finds himself on the run after being framed by Salazar (Javier Bardem), a ghostly pirate captain seeking revenge against him. He teams up with Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) and Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) to find Poseidon's Trident which can break the curse placed upon Salazar and his crew.\n\nI enjoyed this film more than On Stranger Tides becasue there were less characters introduced into the storyline so we could focus more on our main protagonists. There are some grate action sequences throughout including one involving a giant squid which was very well done. Javier Bardem gives a good performance as Salazar although he doesn't have much screen time compared to other villains in previous films such as Davy Jones or Blackbeard. Geoffrey Rush also reprises his role as Barbossa who now serves under Governor Swann played by Orlando Bloom who makes his return after appearing briefly during At World's End. Kaya Scodelario does well playing Carina Smyth who becomes involved with both Jack & Henry while trying to prove herself worthy enough amongst men despite being labeled as a witch due to her knowledge about astronomy/astrology etc.. She gets captured several times throughout but always manages escape somehow!\n\nOverall this wasn't too shabby considering how long these movies have been going on now - 14 years since Curse Of The Black Pearl came out back then... Still fun though even if parts felt familiar like when they went through town looking for clues leading them towards their destination just like before except instead of Will Turner searching for Elizabeth Swan here we got Henry Turner doing something similer albeit slightly different since he didn't know where exactly she lived unlike Will did way back when first meeting each other again after many years apart due to circumstances beyond anyone's control whatsoever...

    "This flick is exactly what you expect from a movie called The Expendables. All the muscle-bound, aging has-been's that no one has heard from in years. (I mean 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, anybody?) All they need is a decent plot and script and someone to get excited, and they'll be back to where they were about fifteen years ago.\n\nOkay, so let's talk about the plot (or lack thereof).\n\nThe Expendables are a group of mercenaries that go into villages and towns that the bad guys (Arnold and his minions) have run out of town and redo the areas to be \"safe\" again.\n\nThat's pretty much the plot.\n\nThe team meets up again, and one of the members wants them to go on a job for the CIA for some cash. Not a good idea considering the guy running the CIA is Stalone. They're going to go in and take down a man that's been running around the country and killing people for the past couple of years without any repercussions, only to discover at the end of the movie that he was a victim of Stalone before that.\n\nThe job's not going to be easy. In fact, the CIA tells them that they need to be careful, becuase they've tried to take the guy down several times.\n\nHow bad is it going to be for the boys? Well, they're going up against Stalone, who's running around in a Hummer with three guys who could have beaten all the Expendable's asses in the begining of the movie without any problem. Let's put it this way: there will be a lot of shooting with pistols, machine guns, and those little hand thingys that put out a shower of bullets for a whole second, all done by men the age of 50. Just for one example, Stallone is shooting a UZI with one hand and holding his arm out without any support. This should be good.\n\nIf you think that they're going to be defeated, you are wrong. There will be a lot of shooting (I'm not kidding about this). There will be a lot",

Ledbetter Wright as Julius Jones also deserves special mention for his portrayal of the team's star lineman.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of the film is its exploration of themes such as racism, discrimination, and perseverence. It shows how sports can be used as a means of bringing people together and overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Additionally, the chemistry between the cast members on screen is palpable, making the characters feel real and relatable.\n\nOverall, \"Remember the Titans\" is a must-see family film that will inspire audiences of all ages to chase after their dreams, no matter what obstacles they may face.\"",

    "When you're on the run from your past, the right freind can make a big diffrence. And when you're in prison and your only escape is to play a series of mind games against one of the most manipulative beings you'll ever meet, your freind had better know how to play the game.\nMike Fratantoni is a gambler. And gambling is his passion. As a result of his obsession, he had been arrested, and while behind bars, he started a series of games where he bet on everything that happened around him.\nThe game that Mike and Nick start is simple. They bet on who's going to fall in love first, how they will do it and if they will last. From the start, you see that Nick and Mike will become real friends and that Mike's game is not the only thing on his mind. You also see that the two of them, in their own way, are trying to escape their pasts.\nWhile Mike is trying to escape by playing his game, and Nick is trying to escape by falling in love, a series of complications ensues between the two friends. They have the same woman (Amanda Peet) that is in love with one of them. One of them makes the other into his best man for his wedding—a wedding which ends in complete disaster.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this film, and the one which makes it unique, is not that it stars Sean Penn (who plays the main character) and Michael Beach (who plays Dr. Fratantoni), but that it is actually based on a true account of a real man who was playing a game while in prison. This story, which is said to be based on true events from the life of William Goldman (whose credits include The Princess Bride and Marathon Man), creates a complex human drama that could never be found in just a fictional story. If you take a look beyond all the game theory and the romance that makes this film enjoyable, you can see a series of real life situations that take place between two prisoners that will make you reflect on the meaning of the human condition. It is a story of the power of friendship; of loyalty and of the human weakness that makes us all want to escape sometimes, even if it's just for a little while.\n\"The Game\" is not a film about winning. It's about friendship and winning",

Shortly after arriving, he discovered that the division was woefully unprepared for the rigors of jungle warfare, and that he had a full fledged mutiny on his hands. When his attempts to correct the problems proved futile, the General took action, and went straight to Colonel Moore (Mel Gibson), who was to be in command of a battalion of the Division. Although the Colonel was a capable officer, he had doubts about the wisdom of the General's actions. However, at the urging of the General, who told him to be a \"hammer and show no mercy\", but also to lead his soldiers from the front, the Colonel, whose real name was Joe, accepted this challenge. Shortly after, Captain Anderson (Gregory), the CO of Alpha Company, was reassigned to command Bravo Company, and replaced by Captain Harris (Scott Glenn), who did not have much respect for Joe. When the company began to complain about the amount of time that they were spending out in the jungle, Harris took to task a private, saying that \"soldiers don't like to fight\".\nBut not to be undone, and after an attempt to reason with him, Joe led 2 platoons of Bravo Company, one of them lead by 2nd Lt. Upham (Madeleine Stowe), into an open area, where they began a battle with the VC. However, it was also from this \"ambush\" that all of the men in the company, save for 2nd Lt. Upham, received their medals of valor. That night, Captain Harris told Joe that he should turn in his resignation, but Joe said that he was not going to, as it was this platoon that would be taking over Bravo Company. In the ensuing battles, several of these soldiers, including 2nd Lt. Upham, died. But then once more, the men of Bravo Company were awarded medals for their actions there. But even with all of its losses, Joe's Company continued on the mission at hand, killing countless numbers of VC in the process.\nCaptain Harris was replaced by Captain Hathcock (Kurtwood Smith), and it was he who was killed in an ambush on Bravo",

    "An orator in his youth, Marcus (later Emperor) Anicius Ordenius Florus was also a prolific orator and rhetorician who achieved some fame at Rome prior to his consulship. While not very influential as a political theorist, his writings helped shape Roman cultural thought, especially its philosophical traditions on the interplay between reason and passion, with which he greatly disagreed. During an imperial visit he addressed a meeting of senators gathered by Cicero; the adress contains several passages that became standard models for later works in this area of philosophy. After Caesar's death many important texts were discovered under his bedside. These included two early treatises on justice entitled Panegyrica and Elegia.

    "Andrew Meikle (1766 – 8 April 1818) was a Scottish inventor, mechanical engineer, and manufacturer, widely regarded as the \"Father of the Steam Engine\". He is best known for his improvements to the Newcomen atmospheric engine, which he patented in 1784. Meikle's inventions and innovations greatly contributed to the development of the steam engine, which in turn revolutionized transportation, manufacturing, and mining.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAndrew Meikle was born in 1766 in the village of Hamilton, near Lanarkshire, Scotland. He was the son of a blacksmith, and his father's brother was a millwright. Meikle received a basic education at a local school, but he was largely self-taught in mechanics and engineering. As a child, he was fascinated by machinery and spent much of his free time tinkering with engines and gears.\n\nInvention of the improved Newcomen engine\n\nIn 1784, Meikle patented an improved version of the Newcomen atmospheric engine, which had been invented a decade earlier. The Newcomen engine was a type of steam engine that used a piston to convert steam pressure into mechanical work. However, it had several limitations, including the fact that it could only be used to pump water, and it was inefficient at converting steam energy into useful work.\n\nMeikle's improvements to the Newcomen engine addressed these limitations. He replaced the piston with a larger, more efficient one, and he added a condenser to the engine, which allowed the steam to be cooled and condensed more efficiently. These improvements greatly increased the efficiency of the engine, making it more versatile and useful for a wider range of applications.\n\nImpact on industry and transportation\n\nMeikle's improvements to the Newcomen engine had a profound impact on industry and transportation. The steam engine became a key component of the Industrial Revolution, powering the machines that drove the factories and mills that produced the goods that fueled the growth of the British Empire.\n\nThe steam engine also revolutionized transportation, allowing for the development of steamships and steam-powered locomotives.

    "In 1797 a group led by John and William Fairfax purchased land in what was then Cumberland County (now Adams) for $1 per acre to establish their own community.[2] The town's name came about when one member suggested that they call it after his hometown back east; another said he would do so if someone else named theirs as well—and thus two towns were born with identical names on opposite sides of America!

    "In Christianity, a higher life refers to any Christian experiance that goes beyond what one might expect in ordinary church membership or attendance.[1] The term was used by Charles Finney and others during his time as part of their revivalist efforts; it has also been applied more recently within Pentecostalism (see Holiness Movement) where there are many different views on how this can be achieved[2]. In some cases these experiences have led people into new denominations such those founded around William J Seymour's Azusa Street Revival which began with black Americans but spread throughout North America before World War I when white Christians joined them at meetings held outdoors under tents called 'tabernacles'. This type became known simply becasue they were often located near railroad tracks so trains could stop nearby while passengers waited for connections elsewhere along its route - hence our modern word taboo comes directly outta here too! It all started back then though not just among African-Americans either since whites had already begun attending services together long ago even if only sporadically due mainly economic reasons rather than religius ones per se.\"",
