    "We propose and analyse a smoothing-free version of the \"Petrov-Galerkin\" method for the Helmholtz problem with a large  for a numerical simulation of the radiation and wave field. As trial functions, we use standard, continuous, positive, Q1-finite elements at a coarse discretization scale $H$, while the test functions are based on the solutions of local problems at a finer discretization scale $h$. The support of the test functions is then given as a function of the  dimension, the size of which depends on a certain oversampling factor. $m$ cdot $log(kappa)$ and $h$ is sufficiently small, the method is stable and quasi-optimal in the regime where $H$ is proportional to $kappa-1$. In a homogeneous medium (or, more generally, periodic), the fine-scale test functions depend only on the local mesh structure, and therefore the numerical cost of the test functions can be drastically reduced on structured meshes. We give numerical experiments in two and three dimensions.",
    "As already mentioned, region-based methods have proven useful for improving the segmentation accuracy of neuronal structures in EM images. Most of these methods rely on a scoring function to determine the merging of regions. These scoring functions are usually learned by supervised learning with large amounts of ground-truth data, which are expensive to obtain. We propose a semi-supervised learning approach that reduces this need. By using a tree-based structure for region merging, we develop a differentiable unsupervised loss that forces the learned function to make consistent predictions. We then propose a Bayesian model that combines the supervised and unsupervised information for probabilistic learning. Experimental results on three EM image data sets show that, with only a small subset of the ground-truth data, 3-7% of the total amount, our method can achieve performance very close to the best fully supervised method using the full ground truth.",
    "In this paper we propose a new class of dynamic mixture models (DAMMs) which can sequentially adapt the mixture components and the mixture composition based on information coming from the data. The information-driven nature of the proposed class of models allows us to calculate exactly the full likelihood and to avoid simulation schemes. Extensive Monte-Carlo experiments show that the new proposed model accurately represents the more complex Stochastic Dynamic Mixture Model, which was proposed in the literature. It also demonstrates that the new model can be used to accurately approximate the Stochastic Dynamic Mixture Model, which was introduced in the last issue of the work, and other similar models. The properties of the new proposed class of models are discussed throughout the paper. We also report on an application to financial econometrics.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to perform very well on a variety of tasks, including tasks related to driving, such as image segmentation and object recognition. However, the training of these networks requires large amounts of data and a long time to converge. In this paper, we first examine the design principles of end-to-end driving networks by presenting three small and inexpensive end-to-end neural network models that generate driving control signals directly from input images. In contrast to previous work that mainly focuses on image processing, our network is designed with a novel approach to the driving task, using a very small number of cheap layers and low-cost deep convolutional neural networks to tackle a complex end-to-end regression task that predicts both the yaw rate and the accel rate. In addition, we design layers that are optimized for classification so that the network can implicitly learn image semantics. We show that the resulting networks are trained three times faster than the most recent comparable end-to-end driving network and 500 times faster than the AlexNet variants and are still more accurate and more robust to overfitting.",
    "We present sound and complete behaviour bisimilarities for a variant of Dybvig et al.’s calculus of multi-prompted delimited control with dynamic prompt generation. The derivation of our new principles generalizes and extends existing methods for establishing program equivalence in calculi with a single-prompted delimited control. The core of the theory that we develop is presented in the framework of Madiot et al., which allows the smooth integration and composition of bisimulation methods up to now. We further generalize this framework to allow us to express bisimulations on evaluation environments, enabling equivalence proofs for evaluation contexts representing continuations. This change leads to a new and powerful technique for bisimulation proofs in the presence of control operators.",
    "Stochastic ADMM is a popular solution for large-scale learning problems. Stochastic ADMM is to reduce the per-iteration complexity, which is more suitable for big data problems. More recently, in order to speed up the convergence of ADMM, it has been combined with various variance-reduction methods, such as SAG-ADMM and SVRG-ADMM. These methods still have some weaknesses in terms of convergence speed, and their convergence speed with the smoothing constant is not very good. In this paper, we propose a fast stochastic ADMM with variance reduction, which is much faster than existing ADMM, and theoretically prove its convergence speed, which is a theoretical guarantee of the smoothing constant. We also verified its effectiveness and compared it with other common methods.",
    "“Markov random fields are a common modeling technique for a variety of pattern recognition and reconstruction problems in robotics and vision. Unfortunately, inference in MRFs is usually intractable, and related work generally resorts to approximation methods. Among these, semidefinite programming relaxations have proven accurate, but scale poorly and are typically too slow for practical applications. We present two contributions: the first is to use a dual-ascent method to speed up the solution of standard SDP relaxations by utilizing the geometric structure of the problem. This method, known as the Dual Ascent Riemannian Staircase, can solve large instances in seconds. The second contribution is to develop a second, faster method based on a new relaxation of the problem, which requires only a linear addition to solve. It is combined with a fast, scalable solver based on smooth Riemannian optimization. We show that this method, known as Fast Unconstrained Semidefinite Escalator, can solve large instances in milliseconds. Unlike local MRF solvers such as belief propagation, our methods require no initial guessing. Moreover, we take advantage of recent results in convexity to ensure that each solution is approximately sub-optimal. We test these methods on multiclass image segmentation problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (i) FUSES and DARS produce near-optimal solutions with an objective  within 0.1% of the optimal, (ii) FUSES is more than two orders of magnitude faster than DARS, but with similar accuracy, and (iii) FUSES outperforms local solvers while achieving the same approximate quality.",
    "We show a general class of unbounded operators in Banach spaces whose local spectral radius can be determined at certain points. For such operators we show that the local spectral radius is analogous to that for a globally defined bounded operator on a Banach space with the single-valued extension property. In practice, an operator of the above class appears as the (extension of) a differential operator which, roughly speaking, can be diagonalized on its domain of smooth test functions by a discrete transformation, and where the said transformation establishes an isomorphism between the space of the differential operator in its own topology and a sequence space. We present examples of such (extended) operators (differential operators with constant coefficients on the d-th tori, Jacobi operators, Hermite operators, Laguerre operators) and we indicate further prospects.",
    "A recent study has shown that when the attention mechanism is used in image recognition, the edges of the foreground, that is, the parts of the image representing the healthy tissue, are disproportionately classified as background, resulting in a high false-negative error rate. To combat this high false-negative error rate, we introduce a novel attention mechanism called Pay Attention to Mistakes. The proposed mechanism has two complementary implementations: (a) “explicit” attention focusing on a larger Efficient Receptive Field on the foreground; (b) “implicit” attention focusing on the false positives, by focusing on a smaller Efficient Receptive Field on the background. We tested the proposed mechanism on three tasks: (a) the prediction of the densely spaced vehicle in the Cityscapes dataset; (b) the enhancement of the tumor core in the multi-modal MR images used for BRATS-X; and (c) the segmentation of the stroke lesions using ultrasonic images at ISLES-NaNaN. Our results were compared with state-of-the-art attention mechanisms in medical images, such as self-attention, spatial attention, and spatial channel-mixed attention. For all three tasks, our models outperformed the baseline models in terms of IoU and/or HD. For example, in the second task, the “explicit” implementation of our mechanism reduced the HD of the best baseline by more than 26%, while improving the IoU by more than 3%. Our proposed attention mechanism will benefit a variety of medical and vision tasks that suffer from over-detection of the background.",
    "3D image segmentation plays an important role in biomedical image analysis. Many 2D and 3D deep learning models have been reported to achieve state-of-the-art results in the segmentation of 3D biomedical images. However, both 2D and 3D models have their own advantages and disadvantages, and by combining them together, one may be able to get more accurate results. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for 3D biomedical image segmentation that combines the merits of 2D and 3D models. First, we design a meta-learner that learns to improve the results of 2D and 3D models by using a fully convolutional network, and then we propose a new training method to minimize the overfitting of our advanced meta-learner, using the results of 2D and 3D models as the \"ground truth\" of the meta-learner. Our new method does not rely on hand-annotated data, and it can be used to train the model with a large amount of unlabeled data. The results of experiments on two public data sets (the HVSMR 2016 Challenge and the mouse piriform cortex) show that our method can achieve good performance in fully supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning modes, and it can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",
    "A FAACUSATION ON THE FACADE OF A CITY IMAGE, taken from a DUCT, involves several peculiar difficulties in contrast to a FAACUTE OF AN IMAGE FROM A PHOTO. A FAACUTE OF AN IMAGE FROM A CITY STREET, is the most difficult of problems. A FAACUTE OF A STREET is a mosaic of the two: the two elements are highly corroborative and varied in their characteristics. In this paper we propose three distinct ANN architectures of varying complexity, which are intended to achieve multi-label semantic segmentation of facade images by exploiting their peculiar properties. We propose a MULTIFACSEGNET, a low-rank ANN architecture for extracting rectangular elements, and a COMPATIBILITY ANN which seeks simultaneously the segmentation of the various elements of the facade. Our results on a well-known dataset demonstrate significant improvements over the state of the art for a variety of elements on the facade, including an accuracy of 0.97 on windows, the most important architectural element.",
    "Given a commutative ring A, a “formal A-module” is a formal group equipped with the action of A. There is a classification ring of the formal A-modules. The article proves structural results on the classifying ring and on the moduli stack of the formal A-modules. A result is proved that, given a certain generator of the group H1_fl (M_fm_Z), which also generates, through the Adams–Novikoff sequence, the first stable homotopy group of the spheres, we obtain the generator of the formal A-module H1_fl (M_fm_A_2-buds; ) for any torsion-free Noetherian commutative ring A, for any torsion-free commutative ring A. We prove that the order of the formal A-modules H1_1_fl(M_fm_A_2-buds; ) and H2_fl (M_fm_A_2_buds) is 2N_1 where N_1 is the leading coefficient in the leading local zeta function of A. The cohomology of the formal A-modules is closely related to the symplectic structure on commutative rings studied in commutative algebra. In particular, the homology of the largest ideal of A which is in the kernel of any homomorphism of commutative rings is given by H0_fl (M_fm_A_2-buds; ). H0_fl (M_fm_A_2-buds; ) is zero only if A is a ring in which the symplectic structure on this ideal is zero.",
    "For several decades now, random fields have been of considerable interest for purposes of inference, especially in image processing. The local nodal interactions which are usually employed in these models are, however, subject to the short-term boundary bias problem, which is largely corrected by the addition of long-range nodal interactions. The problem of tractability becomes very important when long-range nodal interactions are incorporated, particularly when large numbers of long-range nodal interactions are modeled, as in fully-connected random fields. In this paper, we introduce a generalized random field framework, based on the concept of the Stochastic Clique, which provides a stochastically constructed sparse representation of the random field, enabling efficient inference with fully-connected random fields without any restrictions on the potential function which may be used. We discuss and evaluate several implementations of the proposed framework with graph cuts, and experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to provide efficient structured inference in fully-connected random fields, with excellent results for the task of image segmentation, compared to existing fully-connected and principled deep random-field frameworks.",
    "This regression is of great interest in the modelling of spatial point processes in ecology and public health, for example, to determine whether the geographical or geographically defined environment is a significant modifier of the spatial associations between events and the outcomes. If we extend these regressions to clustering, then the likelihood-based inference becomes difficult to compute because of the complexity of the likelihood and its score function. It is therefore interesting to consider estimation procedures based on simpler likelihoods. We derive an estimation procedure for the class of first-order estimating functions. The estimation procedure depends on the solution of a Fredholm integral equation, which in practice is solved by numerical integration. The approximate solution is equivalent to a quasi-likelihood for spatially defined, binomial data, and hence the term quasi-likelihood is used to denote our approach of using the optimal estimating function. We show by simulation and an example with data that the quasi-likelihood-based method for spatial point processes is statistically and computationally efficient.",
    "The gauge formalism in teleparallel gravity is an interesting tool to describe interactions in the context of an anholonomic-observed tetrad. The algebra of the perturbed space-time with the Weitzenbock connection may be compared to a local complexification of the SU(4) Yang-Mills theory, which we call hypercolor or simply color. The formulation of the hypercolor dynamics is accomplished by a translational gauge, as in teleparallel gravity. This work, in particular, is concerned with the perturbation of a decomposition of a metric related to the Wilson line and the Kaluza-Klein metric, which gives a version of four-dimensional electrodynamics. The coordinates of space-time are now matrices representing elements of the SU(4) Lie algebra. To make the formulation of a colored gravity consistent with the Lorentz force and Maxwell equations, it is enough to place the energy potentials with zero potential at the event horizon, instead of the usual zero potential at infinity. The framework of colored gravity provides an abelian limit of standard electromagnetism.",
    "Clustering is an important tool in data mining and has been widely used in many applications. In this paper, an extension of the Fuzzy C-Means clustering is proposed. Instead of the single membership value used in the original Fuzzy C-Means clustering, a multi-dimensional membership vector of each point is used instead of the traditional membership value. Each membership value of a point is obtained by considering each feature of the point and calculating the membership value for each feature. Moreover, an initial cluster center search method that closely converges to the real cluster center is proposed. This method is evaluated by analyzing two standard data sets. In addition, the effect of the proposed method is examined by comparing the image segmentation problem with the Fuzzy C-Means clustering.",
    "This paper proposes a deep learning-based method for ranking response surfaces with application to financial mathematics. The underlying problem of ranking response surfaces is to efficiently determine the corresponding index to the minimal response in a continuous input space $mathcal X  MathBb$. By treating the points in the space of X as pixels and the corresponding response indices as labels, we can reformulate the problem as a classification problem in image segmentation, wherein an image is divided into a number of distinct regions, each of which has its own label. This provides an alternative way to solve the problem, as opposed to the sequential method that we used in our previous work (Hu R. and Ludkovski M., Journal of Uncertainty Quantification 5 (2017) 212–239). The approach is scalable and parallel, and since the solution is not subject to any model-free assumption about the form of the response surface, it is model-free. Finally, it allows us to apply a wide class of deep learning models for image segmentation, such as U-Net, Seg-Net and DeconvNet, which have been shown to be highly accurate in this field. We systematically study the dependence of deep learning on the input data generated by uniform grids and sequential sampling, and we observe that deep learning is relatively insensitive to the noise and the location (near or far from the boundary) of the training data. We show by a few examples, both synthetic and real-world, that this method is efficient and accurate.",
    "We present observations of the high-intensity HeI 10830 line in 45 low-metal HII regions. We combine these NIR observations with optical spectroscopic measurements in order to determine the primordial He abundance. The HeI 10830 line, whose intensity is very sensitive to the density of the HII regions, greatly improves the determination of the physical conditions of the He+ zone. It results in a tighter regression Y — O/H than all previous studies. From these data, we have selected a sample of 28 HII regions with  > 150 A, O-2+/O  0.8, and He abundances determined to better than  3% accuracy. Using this sample, we derive a primordial He abundance Yp = 0.2551 +/- 0.0002 with respect to the sun. The derived Yp value is higher than that predicted by the standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN) model. With our Yp, and D/H = (2.53) +/- 0.0004, we found that the best fit for these abundances is with a baryon density Omega b h2 — 0.02400 +/- 0.00008 at 68%, 0.02800 +/- 0.0002 at 95.4 %, 0.06400 +/- 0.0007 at 95.4 %, and a total number of effective neutrinos Neff = 3.58 +/- 0.24 (at 68% and 95%). At the 99% level, we find that the effective number of neutrino species is not exactly equal to one. This may suggest that there are additional species of neutrino.",
    "Let A be a finitely generated integral domain in Z with characteristic 0. We study the Thue equation F(x,y)=b and hyperelliptic and superelliptic equations f(x)=bym, where F and f are coefficients of A, b is a non-zero element of A and m is an even positive integer. In our results we find an explicit upper bound on the size of x and y by the appropriate representations of A, F, f, b. Also we generalize a result of Schinzel and Tijdeman that there exists a constant C such that there exists no solution of f(x,y)=bym in A for which y is not 0 or a non-zero primitive root of unity if m>C. In our proofs we use effective results on the Thue equation, hyperelliptic and superelliptic equations over number fields and function fields, some results of effective commutative algebra and a commutative law.",
    "Efficiency and ease in the segmentation of images and volumes is of practical importance. The segmentation problems that have inspired our method come from microscopy, a tool widely used in material science, medicine, and biology. We formulate image segmentation as a probabilistic pixel classification problem, and we use segmentation as a step towards characterizing the content of the image. Our method allows the operator to define the structure of interest by marking some of the pixels in the image. Because of the immediate feedback, the operator can place new marks in the image strategically, depending on the current classification results. Our method requires the construction of a graphical representation of the image content, which is built during initialization, unsupervisedly, and is based on clustering image features. As our method combines a limited amount of operator-marked data with clustering information obtained from the unmarked parts of the image, it falls within the general framework of semisupervised learning. We show that such a semisupervised strategy can be a very efficient one for image classification.",
    "We present a method to deal with the ill-posed scales of the model in the context of the ensemble-transform Kalman filter (ETKF). It extends to this class of algorithms the deterministic model error formulation that has recently been developed for the extended Kalman filter. The necessary model uncertainty for the update of the state of the system is estimated from the increments of the reanalysis. Two different versions of the method are described: a time-constant model error treatment where the model error statistical description is held constant in time, and a time-varying treatment where the assumed model error statistical distribution is sampled at each reanalysis. We compare both methods with the standard method of dealing with the model error through the standard scheme of calibration and model error inflation, and illustrate our results with numerical simulations on a nonlinear system with chaotic behavior. The results show that the skill of the filter is greatly improved by the model error formulation, and that both methods require far less adjustment than the standard scheme. The proposed approach is simple to implement within an existing structure based on an ensemble. The general usefulness of the proposed method in the context of square-root filters such as the ETKF is also discussed.",
    "GETTING A CONNECTION MAP FROM A TRANSMISSION-ELECTRON MICROSCOPIED IMAGE OF THE NEURAL CORTEX, TO DO SO, INVOLVES IDENTIFICATION OF NERVE CELLS AND CERTIFICATION OF INTERNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM. GETTING THEM BY HAND IS A VERY TIME CONSUMING PROCESS, AND IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE DELAYED TIME, TO DO BYOUgD’S APPENDIX THERE HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATED. This disparity may be partly accounted for by several factors: obtaining neuronal shapes is an essential first step in obtaining a connectome, tracing is much more time consuming than annotating synapses, and neuronal contact areas may be used as a proxy for synaptic contact areas to determine connections. Also, in recent research, the contact area alone has been found not to be a reliable predictor of the synaptic contact. And as the methods for obtaining neuronal shapes have improved, the time for annotating synapses has become an increasingly significant portion of the total time for the reconstruction. This disparity is bound to increase further as neuronal shape reconstruction methods become better, thus limiting the possible speed up of the process. In this study, we have addressed this problem by developing an automatic method for obtaining both pre- and post-synaptic structures. The pre-synaptic structures are obtained using a deep and wide recursive neural network, and the post-synaptic structures are obtained using a neural network, with features based on the local neuronal shape. This method requires very little supervised training and takes advantage of recent advances in image segmentation. We introduce novel metrics to evaluate the performance of our system, and show that complete automatic prediction may provide an adequate account of most connections.",
    "With probabilistic databases, query evaluation is generally intractable (#P-hard). Existing dichotomies have identified tractable queries, and associated them with tractable lineages. In our previous work, using a different tool, we have shown that query evaluation is linear time on probabilistic data bases for arbitrary monadic second-order queries, if we bound the treewidth of the instance. In this paper, we study restrictions and extensions of this result. First, we show that for probabilistic queries, the scope of monadic second-order tractability does not extend beyond bounded treewidth: even for queries of second order, there exist instances of graphs with unbounded treewidth that are intractable. This dichotomy relies on recent polynomial-time bounds on the extraction of planar minors, and also implies lower bounds in the non-probabilistic setting, for the evaluation of queries and the counting of matchings in the families of subinstance-closed families. Second, we show that our tractability result can be explained in terms of lineages: the lineage of MSO queries on bounded-treewidth instances consists of bounded-treewidth circuits, polynomial-size OBDDs, and linear-size d-DNNFs. Moreover, we strengthen the dichotomy for lineages, and show that for UCQs with disjunctions, the unbounded-treewidth query consists of an OBDD that is super-polynomial, and characterize them. Finally, we explain the tractability of safe queries by considering a set of instances with bounded treewidth.",
    "This paper presents a new method for image segmentation, which combines the advantages of both conditional random fields and decision trees. In general, the potential function in the literature is defined by a linear combination of some predefined parametric models, and methods such as structured support vector machines (SVM) are used to learn these linear coefficients. Here we propose a new formulation for the potential function, which represents the unary and pairwise potentials as non-parametric forests, and then learn the ensemble and the trees as a single optimization problem in the framework of a large margin. This approach enables non-linear learning of both the unary and pairwise potential functions in the random field. Furthermore, we use the decision trees to represent the discrimination of each object in the image. Because of the rich structure and flexibility of decision trees, our method is powerful in representing complex data dependencies and class associations. The resulting large-scale convex problem is extremely difficult to solve because it has exponentially many independent and dependent variables. We show that this difficult problem can be efficiently solved by combining the column generation method with the plane cutting method. Experimental results on the one-class (Graz-02, Weizmann horse, Oxford flower) and two-class (MSRC-2, Pascal-Voc) datasets show the effectiveness of the learned non-linear, non-parametric potential functions.",
    "The segmentation of two-valued images of porous media is a crucial step towards a deeper understanding of the factors governing the biogeochemical processes at a microscopic scale. In recent years, a large amount of research has been carried out, mainly on the basis of primitive methods based on the use of either a global or local threshold that is well known for its limitations in the image segmentation. Moreover, the lack of a unified and quantifiable standard limits the ability to evaluate existing methods. This paper addresses both problems. Firstly, based on a method of automatic segmentation developed for natural images, a method is proposed for the automatic segmentation of porous media images, named 3D Quantum Cuts (QCuts-3D), and based on the current state-of-the-art spectral clustering technique. Secondly, a data set of 68 images of porous media with various solid geometries and with a ground truth of phase in each voxel is prepared and made publicly available. We test the proposed method against other current state-of-the-art methods on this data set and find that the method is robust to variations in the composition of porous media.",
    "But to train a DNN requires a large amount of annotated data, which is costly and time-consuming for medical image segmentation tasks. This paper presents a new, error-aware semi-supervised framework for the segmentation of the left atrium from three-dimensional MR images. Our framework can make full use of the unlabeled data, promoting consistency of the prediction for the same input under different perturbations. The framework consists of a student model and a teacher model, the student model learns from the teacher model by minimizing the total loss, including the loss of the training error, the overall loss, and the consistency loss. We propose a novel error-aware learning framework to help the student model learn from the meaningful and reliable labeled targets, by taking advantage of the available error information. Experiments show that the performance of the student model is greatly improved by the use of unlabeled data. Compared with the results of semi-supervised learning methods, our method outperforms them.",
    "The task of polarimetric SAR image segmentation is currently of great importance for remote sensing applications. Nevertheless, it is a difficult task for two main reasons: Firstly, due to the high cost of the classification, it is difficult to obtain a large number of examples. Secondly, the required background information is not available in the image. Moreover, the speckle noise in the SAR images, which is inherent in the SAR image acquisition process, has a significant influence on the quality of the segmentation. In this paper, a context-aware semantic polarimetric SAR image segmentation method is proposed. The new channel-compatible feature set is used as the input to the three-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (D3) method to extract multi-scale features that are robust to speckle noise. Finally, a Markov random field is used to ensure the smoothness of the segmentation labels. The proposed method for the first time takes full advantage of the available background information to ensure accurate and smooth classification. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are carried out on three real polarimetric SAR images from the ALOS-2, ALOS and ALOS-2 Apertures, and the results show that the proposed method achieves excellent classification accuracy and spatial consistency with a small number of classified samples.",
    "We consider weak convergence theorems of the quantum walk (DTQW) whose paths are based on intervals. We show that continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) and discrete-time random walk (DTRW) can be expressed in the form of DTQW for certain limits. We first generalize our previous study [2 Physics Letters A 40 (5) p. 81-82, 1994] to general walks with variable step length. Further, we develop a new result on the DTQW with position measurements. We show that the step length has a unique probability distribution with probability p, where n is the final time and p is the time-step probability. Also, we give the continuous-time analog of the DTQW. Second, we introduce a new class of DTQW for which the absolute value of the diagonal of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse final time. In addition, we prove weak convergence theorems for this DTQW. This DTQW is named final-time dependent DTQW. We prove the weak convergence theorem for this DTQW which has a number of interesting properties. Third, we consider the final-time dependent DTQW with periodic position measurements. This weak convergence theorem shows a phase diagram which can be used to find the relation between the continuous-time and discrete-time random walk for sufficiently long times.",
    "It has become one of the main lines of research. Medical image segmentation is often needed for the diagnosis of diseases in clinical evaluation. However, the images used in medical diagnosis are not smooth, and the results of the image segmentation method cannot be obtained. The first thing to do is to pre-process it. In order to get the most suitable method for medical image segmentation, we propose a two-stage segmentation method. The first step is to automatically generate a binary image using mathematical morphology, and the second step is to generate a 2D boundary using a convolution kernel. The boundary of the image is used as a mask image for the second step, and the GrabCut method is applied to the original image, and the image is efficiently segmented. The result can be further improved by using a graphical user interface. The results of the experiment show that the proposed method is accurate and that satisfactory results can be obtained with minimal interaction with the human brain in both medical and natural images.",
    "Over the past few years, the community of computer vision has made a huge leap in semantic image segmentation, a pixel-wise classification task that is critical for dense scene understanding and which is already widely used in many real-world applications such as unmanned cars or medical image diagnosis. Recent models are now able to reach previously unimaginable performance numbers, such as 89% mean iou on Pascal VOC and 83% on Cityscapes, and although the performance measured by iou and other metrics provides a general view of performance, we are now going to develop other meaningful and important for the applications characteristics such as answering the questions “how accurate is the model at recognizing small objects in the general scene?” and “what causes the model to make an error?” Besides establishing a methodology that covers the performance of a single model from different perspectives, we will also show several extensions that are likely to be useful in further improving the current best result in semantic image segmentation.",
    "We prove lower bounds on the energy of point particles in the Gaussian core model. For the potential with e-t  -alpha with 0  alpha  4 pi  e, we prove that for a density $rho$ on the sphere with radius $n$ and potential $t$  e-t -alpha t$ with 0  alpha  4 pi  e$, there is no point configuration in a sphere of radius $R$ with density $rho$ and -a -a (fixed) less than the expected value of energy $rho (pi  alpha) n  2$ as $n to infty$, with the alpha and the rho fixed. The proof is based on the solution of a certain interpolation problem similar to the one from the Beurling-Selberg problem. On the other hand, we prove that the upper bound for the energy is not asymptotically sharp when $alpha geq pi e$. As a consequence of our results, we obtain a bound on the energy under the inverse power law, $t to t n + s$, with $s > 0$, and these bounds are sharp up to a constant factor as $n to infinity$, with $s$ fixed.",
    "Deep learning methods have a difficult generalization problem in the deployment of practical applications. For this reason, we propose a method for generalization, which is to learn a universal representation of the data from multiple source domains, and to improve the generalization of the network to the unseen domains. This paper first analyzes the generalization capability of neural networks by combining multiple consistency metrics and tries to determine which metrics are the most synergistic. Finally, we present a novel hierarchical consistency framework for generalization, which combines extrinsic consistency and intrinsic consistency. In particular, we enforce consistency by utilizing the knowledge of multiple source domains., and also use a Fourier-based amplitude Gaussian-mixing method to improve consistency. intrinsically, we enforce consistency between the same instance of data by using dual task formulations. The proposed HCDG framework is evaluated on two medical image segmentation tasks, namely the optic disc segmentation on fundus images and the prostate MR segmentation. Extensive experiments have proven the effectiveness and applicability of the HCDG framework. The source code will be available upon acceptance.",
    "This paper deals with the problem of real-time semantic segmentation of high-definition images using a hybrid GPU/CPU architecture. We propose an Efficient Video Segmentation (EVS) pipeline which combines: (i) on the CPU, a very fast optical flow method which exploits the temporal aspect of the image and propagates the semantic information from one frame to the next. This process is done in parallel with the GPU. (ii) on the GPU, two convolutional neural networks: a main network for predicting dense semantic labels from scratch, and a refinement network which improves the predictions of the previous frame with the help of a fast inconsistency attention mechanism (IAM). This mechanism identifies regions that cannot be propagated with certainty. We recommend several operating points depending on the required frame rate and accuracy. Our EVS pipeline achieves accuracy levels comparable to those obtained with the most accurate real-time methods for semantic image segmentation (more than 60% IoU) while providing much higher frame rates. The operating points that we propose range from 80 to 1000 fps on a single GPU and CPU.",
    "In our last [Sh:300a] we have only a thinly stable situation, and it seemed that we could not proceed further. We wish to develop a theory of models of $T$, which should be a complete theory in $mathbb L theta, theta tau$, provided that $theta$ is a compact cardinal. In treating ultrapowers (and ultraproducts) we restrict ourselves to $D$ a $theta$-complete ultrafilter on $I$, probably regular. Our basic theorems hold, but can we generalize the axioms of model theory, especially stability, and in particular generalize [Shc:2c, ch. 6]? We prove that we can characterize the models of $T$ which are minimal by Keisler order, i.e. where $D:D$ is a regular ultrafifer on $$ and where $M : T  M lambda r D$ is the saturated $$. We also manage to connect our study with the logic $mathbb L theta, theta tau$ introduced in [Sh:797]: two models are $mathbb L theta, theta tau$-equivalent if, for any $omega$-series of $theta$-complete ultrafinites, the iterated ultrapowers of the two models are equivalent.",
    "With the development of Internet technology, social network and other related fields, user authentication has become an increasingly important method of protecting the data of the users. Password identification is one of the widely used methods of identifying legitimate users and preventing unauthorized users from accessing the system. There have been many password decryption methods in the past few years, and people have been designing a series of password cracking countermeasures. But I find that there is not much survey research on password cracking. This article is mainly to give a brief introduction to the methods of password decryption, the important techniques of password decryption, and the password protection countermeasures that are generally used in two stages: one is the password design (such as: password education, the use of tokens, the generation of passwords by the computer), the other is the after-design (such as: the use of mobile phones, the installation of the network. When you enter a password, it will immediately prompt you to enter a password, which can be used as a reminder. The implementation of access control). The main purpose of this paper is to provide basic knowledge for neophyte information security engineers and the general public, and to promote the development of this field. The keywords are: password decryption, password cracking, cryptanalysis, countermeasures.",
    "On the other hand, advances in generative models and adversarial training have resulted in the growing image-to-image (I2I) translation literature. The current I2I methods require images from both domains, which are either paired (supervised) or unpaired (unsupervised). In practice, it is often very expensive and cumbersome to obtain the paired data. However, the unpaired I2I methods are still more widely used although they are less accurate. In this paper, we seek to bridge the gap between the supervised and unsupervised I2I methods with the application of semantic image segmentation. The I2I method is based on two key methods, pix2pix and CycleGAN. We introduce a method for selecting a small number of pairs to improve the performance of the supervised and unsupervised I2I translation methods, and we further improve the accuracy by including the (selected) paired samples and the unpaired samples together in the training. Our experiments show that an extremely weakly supervised I2I translation solution with only one paired training sample can achieve the same performance as the unsupervised CycleGAN model, which is much better than the supervised pix2pix model that was trained on thousands of paired images.",
    "Meanshift is a popular mode-seeking clustering algorithm widely used in machine learning. However, it is well known that it is too slow, as the time required per iteration is quadratic. In this paper, we propose Meanshift++, a very fast mode-seeking clustering based on Meanshift, which uses a grid-based approach to accelerate the meanshift step by replacing the expensive neighbors search with the weighted mean of the neighboring cells. In addition, we prove the theoretical properties of the meanshift++ method. The time required is linear in the number of points and only exponential in the dimension, which makes it suitable for applications with low dimensions, such as image segmentation and object tracking. Our experiments show that Meanshift++ is at least 10,000 times faster than Meanshift, with similar clustering results on some benchmark data sets and similar image segmentation results on some data sets. Finally, we show that Meanshift++ has a good performance on object tracking.",
    "Active contour models (ACM) have been widely used in computer vision and image processing. Recent studies have combined active contours with convolutional neural networks to replace the hand-designed energy function, in order to overcome the limitations of ACM, which rely on the parameterization of the energy function and initialization. However, these studies have not dealt with initialization, which is the main problem in the study. In addition to manual initialization, the initialization method is sensitive to the starting point and fails to accurately delimit the boundary. We propose a completely automatic image segmentation method to overcome the initialization problem, inadequate input range and insufficient border accuracy, as well as the energy function design problem. We use two convolutional neural networks to train active contour weights, obtain ground truth, distance transform, and initialization circle. The distance transform is a field in which each pixel in the image is mapped to the boundary of the nearest distance, and the energy is a function of the distance map. We test the method on four public image datasets: two buildings of Vaihingen and Bing Hut, and two breast images of INBreast and DDSM-BCRP. The test results show that our method outperforms previous research by 0.59 and 2.39 in the mean IoU, 7.38 and 8.62 in Boundary F-score in Vaihingen and Bing Hut, respectively. On the INBreast and DDSM-BCRP, the Dice similarity coefficients are 94.23 and 91.89. This shows that our method is comparable to the existing framework.",
    "To meet the development of systems that are parallel and distributed, the active object model offers a high-level abstraction for the coding of concurrent operations. There already exist a large number of frameworks for active objects, aimed at a wide range of applications, such as modeling, verification, efficient execution. Among these frameworks, however, few are concerned with the parallel execution of active objects. Introduced into active objects, a parallelism that is carefully controlled allows some of their limitations to be overcome. We present here a framework of the multi-active object programming model, illustrated by ProActive, a library for Java which makes multi-active objects available, and MultiASP, a language for formalizing developments of this kind. We then show how to compile a language for active objects with cooperative threads into a language for multi-active objects. Finally, this paper also presents several use cases and the means of development, demonstrating the practical utility of our language. The formalization of our work gives the programmer a guarantee of the behaviour of the model of multi-active objects and of the compiler.",
    "The search for the zero-neutrino double beta decay (onubetabeta) requires extremely low background and a thorough knowledge of their origins and their effect on the rate in the region of the parameter space, which is sensitive to onubetabeta. Here we report a study of beta and gamma background in the EXO-200 0nubeta experiment. We want to understand more precisely the place and the power of particular background sources and compare the results to radioactivity measurements made before and during the construction of the experiment. Finally, we discuss the significance of the study for EXO-200 and the future nEXO experiment, which will be a one-ton experiment.",
    "FSS has many uses in medical image processing. Most of the existing FSS methods rely on an abundance of annotated semantic classes for training, which is difficult for medical images because of the lack of such annotations. Besides, there is a bias-free mechanism that is sensitive to training loss, which combines localized averaged filters and prototypes with the method of pseudo-labelling super-pixels. This paper presents a new self-supervised framework for medical images that completely eliminates the need for annotations during training and generates super-pixels based on pseudo-labels to be used as supervision; (2) an adaptive local pooling mechanism to overcome the problem of foreground-background imbalance in medical image segmentation; (3) three different medical image segmentation tasks are compared, including the segmentation of the gastrointestinal organs in a X-ray, the segmentation of the heart in a magnetic resonance tomography (MR) image and the segmentation of abdominal organs using CT. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of conventional FSS methods which use annotated images for training.",
    "The need for sign language is radically increasing especially among the deaf. Few research groups are working on automatic recognition of signs from videos, hand-painted gloves and the like. However, their approach requires proper data segmentation for both the training data and the data to be recognized. The recognition of sign language is very difficult because of the diversity of hand shapes and hand movements. This paper proposes a combination of image segmentation and restoring hand shape using topological derivatives for high recognition accuracy. Here, the quality of the resulting hand shape is compared subjectively and objectively. The experiment results show that the extra restoration before the image segmentation process is significantly improved the accuracy of hand detection and that the discrete derivatives give high discrimination between different static hand positions as well as between hand positions and background. This research is expected to contribute to the implementation of automatic sign language recognition systems, which are mainly for welfare purposes.",
    "We propose a method of active learning of image and three-dimensional image volumes, which makes use of the geometrical information to speed up and simplify the annotation process. Our method combines geometric smoothness with other uncertainties to estimate the most informative voxels, which are the most instructive, and should be annotated next. In multiclass cases, we also introduce two new criteria of uncertainty. In three dimensions, we use the resulting uncertainty to select voxels that are on a planar patch, which is much more convenient for the end-user than a randomly selected voxel distribution in a volume. The planar patch is found by a branch and bound algorithm, which finds a plane in a three-dimensional volume, on which the most instructive voxels are. We have tested our approach on images of EM and MR volumes, as well as on regular images of horses and faces. Thanks to the geometrical uncertainty, we have obtained a significant increase in performance over previous approaches.",
    "Characterizing the malignant areas in the three-dimensional magnetic resonance images is a crucial operation in the radiotherapy of cancer, which requires the fine contours of the tumor to be carefully outlined at the cost of labor, time and repeatability. While the deep learning-based methods are good bases for the task of 3D image segmentation, the patch is restricted in the restricted field and the segmentation performance is degraded. In addition, determining the region of interest from large whole-volume 3D images brings many benefits in terms of speed, accuracy and false positives. Unlike sliding window or non-joint localization-segmentation models, we propose a novel multi-task framework: the 3D Region-Aware U-Net (the 3D R-U-Net), which combines the tasks of region-of-interest localization and inside-out region-of-interest segmentation with the same underlying convolutional neural network. Encoding, using the area-representation proposals from the encoder, we can build a multi-scale inside-out region-preserving decoder for the digitized object. The applied volume and effective resolution are enlarged. To train the model effectively, we designed a Dice-like loss function for the global-to-local multi-task learning method. In addition, we use the advantage of performance to develop a hybrid framework that combines the functions of the different resolutions of the convolutional neural networks. The model's performance on 64 cancerous cases with a four-fold cross-validation showed significant advantages over existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, the proposed method has a great potential to be extended to other 3D object segmentation tasks from medical images due to its inherent generalizability. The model is publicly available.",
    "Multi-atlas segmentation (MAS), as introduced and popularized by the pioneering work of Rohlfing, Brandt, Menzel and Maurer Jr. (2004), Klein, Mensh, Ghosh, Tourville and Hirsch (2005), and Heckemann, Hajnal, Aljabar, Rueckert and Hammers (2006), is a multi-atlas approach to image segmentation that is one of the most widely used and successful methods in biomedical image processing. By taking advantage of a set of anatomical images (e.g., annotated by an expert), MAS is able to cope with anatomical variety, thus allowing better segmentation, but this flexibility has the disadvantage of high computational cost. Recent advances in both computer hardware and image processing software have addressed this challenge and have enabled a large-scale implementation of MAS. Today, MAS is a sophisticated and increasingly well-developed approach encompassing sophisticated and powerful methods that draw on the ideas of machine learning, probabilistic modeling, optimization, and computer vision, among others. This paper presents a survey of MAS methods and their application to a variety of biomedical problems. Our goals are threefold: First, we want to provide an account of how MAS was originally conceived, how it developed, and how it is compared to other methods. Second, we want to give a detailed account of the research activity in MAS over the past decade (2003–2014), including both methodological developments and application-oriented approaches. Third, we want to give our own view of the future of MAS, which we believe will continue to be one of the dominant methods in the biomedical image processing field.",
    "An important task of image segmentation is the learning of dense prediction models so that they can produce accurate generalizations at difficult pixel locations. A typical group of such difficult pixel locations are boundaries between instances. Many studies have proposed to devote special attention to learning boundaries. Such strategies include using neural networks with the additional task of boundary prediction and boosting the importance of boundary pixel predictions in the loss function. Such strategies require a priori knowledge of where attention should be directed and how to encode it in the model. The difficulty is that there may be many other groups of difficult pixels, and to select and encode the appropriate attention for each group of pixels by hand would not scale. To provide a more general and scalable solution, we propose a new attention model based on boosting. AttentionBoost builds a multi-stage network and a new loss adjustment mechanism to let the dense prediction model learn what to pay attention to in each stage, based on data without requiring any a priori knowledge of what to pay attention to. The mechanism adapts the attention of each stage to the error of the previous stage by adjusting the weight of each pixel in the loss according to how well the previous stage did on that pixel. This mechanism enables AttentionBoost to learn different attentions for different pixels in each stage, depending on how difficult they are to learn, and multiple attentions for the same pixel in different stages, depending on how confident each stage is of its prediction for that pixel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AttentionBoost using the example of predicting glands from radiographs.",
    "By making a cut-out of a line pattern in a picture, a basic step is performed in various applications, such as detecting blood vessels in radiological images, the contouring of rivers and roads in aerial photographs, the detecting of cracks in walls and pavements, and so on. In this paper, we introduce trainable B-COSFIRE filters which are a model of the functions of some of the neurons of the primary visual cortex. These filters are tunable, since they are automatically re-tuned, given a particular example of a desired image. They can be made to detect any kind of a line structure (e.g. lines, corners, intersections, etc.), and so they are useful in automatic learning of an image representation. We have made experiments on two kinds of images, a data set of network lines from INRIA and a set of fundus images called IOSTAR. The results show the stability of the proposed method and its effectiveness in detecting line structures in various kinds of images.",
    "Despite the recent considerable advances in image super-resolution (ISR), its performance has so far been evaluated only perceptually. Consequently, it is still unclear whether ISR can be useful for other visual tasks. In this paper, we report the first comprehensive study and analysis of the usefulness of ISR for other visual applications. In particular, six ISR methods are evaluated for four common visual tasks: edge detection, semantic image segmentation, digit recognition, and scene recognition. Our experiments show that the input images for these tasks can be improved when the inputs are low-resolution. We also study the correlation between four commonly used perceptual metrics—namely, PSNR, SSIM, IFC, and NQM—and usefulness for the tasks. Experiments show that, in general, they have good correlations, but that the perceptual metrics are still not sufficiently accurate to be a good proxy for the usefulness. It is hoped that this work will encourage the community to evaluate ISR methods on real-world applications and to adopt ISR as a pre-processing step for other visual tasks when the input images are low-resolution.",
    "Post-DAE, a method of post-processing based on denoising autoencoders (DAE), has been developed to improve the anatomical plausibility of arbitrary biomedical image segmentation. Some of the most popular segmentation methods (e.g. based on convolutional neural networks and random forest classifiers) have been shown to benefit from the addition of post-processing steps, which ensure that the masks produced meet the expected spatial continuity constraints. These methods work under the assumption that neighbouring pixels with similar appearance should belong to the same class. This assumption, while correct in general, is too basic to be easily incorporated into the methods used. The aim of Post-DAE is to exploit the latest developments in manifold learning via denoising autoencoders. The first step is to learn a compact, non-linear embedding that represents the space of anatomically plausible images. Then, given a mask obtained by an arbitrary method, we project it onto the learned manifold to produce an anatomically plausible mask. The method is trained on the unpaired masks, which makes it independent of the modality and intensity of the images. We have conducted experiments on a multi-class, binary, and spectral decomposition of chest X-rays and cardiac magnetic resonance images. We show how masks with errors and noise can be improved by Post-DAE. Without a significant increase in the computational complexity, the method restores the data from which it is derived to a space where errors are not made.",
    "Fingerprint recognition plays an important role in many commercial applications and is used every day by millions of people, for example to unlock a mobile phone. Fingerprint image segmentation is usually the first processing step of most fingerprint recognition algorithms and consists of dividing an image into a foreground, where the region of interest is located, and a background. There are two types of errors that can occur during this step and that both have a negative effect on recognition performance: the true foreground may be labeled as background, which can lead to the loss of some of the features, such as minutiae, or conversely, the true background may be labeled as foreground, which can lead to the introduction of spurious features. The contribution of this paper is threefold: First, we propose a new method for determining the foreground by using a directional Butterworth Butterworth filter, interlaced with a soft threshold. Finally, we provide 10560 ground truth segments that are marked by hand as an evaluation basis. Second, we perform a detailed comparison between the performance of our FDB method and four of the most frequently cited methods for fingerprint image segmentation, and show that the performance of the FDB method is clearly superior to the performance of the four most widely used methods. The ground truth data as well as the implementation of the FDB method are available.",
    "‘The story is set in London in 1865, and involves Charles Lenox, a gentleman of independent means, who enjoys the odd murder-suddenly solved as a pleasant pastime. He is normally, though, content to spend cold winter days in his library with a book and a cup of tea. This time, however, his lifelong friend Lady Jane Grey, who has been known to him all his life, asks him to lend her a hand. Prudence Smith, her former maid, has been found dead of a supposed suicide. But Lenox immediately suspects murder, and more particularly, murder with a rare and fatal poison. She lived and worked in the household of George Barnard, a house with many suspects. Although she had broken more than one heart, a motive for her death is elusive. When yet another body is found at one of the most fashionable balls of the season, Lenox finds himself obliged to unpick the complicated web of loyalties and animosities that surrounds the mansion of George Barnard. He receives help in his task from his trusty valet, Graham, and his friend, Dr Thomas McConnell. Throughout the story, the efforts of Inspector James Exeter, of Scotland Yard, are in turn helped and hindered by the presence or absence of Lenox, whose assistance is needed, but who needs to appear to be in complete control of the investigation. There are also sub-plots, among which the reader learns of the growing intimacy between Lenox and Lady Grey, and the strain in the marriage of McConnell and Lady Victoria Phillips – all three being recurring characters in previous novels by Charles Finch.",
    "His father’s suicide, when he was a child, occurred on Christmas Eve. It was a fact that his father was then struggling against the Mafia to establish his own undertaker’s business. The Mafia sent a friend to deliver a letter to him on Christmas Eve, and on reading it he went and shot himself. The letter was never found, and no one but the Don, Salvatore Biganti, knows what it contained. On hearing the shot, he had rushed to his father’s side, and saw his father on the floor bleeding from his temples. He knelt in the blood and tried in vain to stop the bleeding. Then the whole thing passed from his mind and he suffered from terrible nightmares. His mother soon afterwards died in a hospital upstate of a nervous breakdown. His aunt in Conn. brought him up and after twenty years he decided to return to New York and take up the profession of undertaker. His psychologist friend at school advised him to get the truth before his psychedelic demons completely enslaved him. The secret of death led him into a labyrinth of lies, greed and evil, and he became caught up in an intricate spider’s web of organized crime, secret cults and unspeakable atrocities. He writhed in torment, unable to cope with the knowledge. The known is worse than the unknown, and he was swept down into a hell of devils and new nightmares.",
    "Gracie knew when a bad thing was going to happen, and sometimes even when it had already happened. She begged her mother not to go on a trip where she met her death when her automobile was struck by an orange truck. And now that she was living in Washington with her Aunt Shay, she had visions of her best friend, Miss Emily. Gracie would rather her psychic powers were not there at all, but when Miss Emily went missing, she had to depend on them to find her friend. The trouble with Gracie’s visions was that she did not know what she was seeing. Sometimes she saw the past, sometimes the present, and sometimes she completely misinterpreted what she had seen. In the hope of finding her friend, Gracie, aided by her cousin Diego, followed the directions of her visions. After a few false starts, she finally caught up with Miss Emily’s abductor and was herself captured. Imprisoned in a dark and sinister house, Gracie began to see visions of the captor’s childhood, the gloomy childhood of the man and his kinsmen. He was a madman who regretted not being able to cure his sick sister Nell. The man had set fire to the house to burn Nell to death, but the rage of his father, who had just lost his beloved wife, had burned all his siblings to death as well. The disillusioned madman now intended to put an end to his existence and was plotting to die with his family.",
    "The book opens with the most amazing extravagances, with Renee and Maxime, asleep in a tuileverrière, emerging very slowly from a Parisian park (the Bois de Boulogne) and locked up in the congestion of the public. It is thus made quite clear from the first lines that these characters are of the greatest riches, which, when they arrive at home, will be dressed for hours by their servants, before presiding over a banquet to which the most opulent people in Paris will come. This scene seems to be very remote from the end of the first novel, but at the beginning of the second, we are told that this opulent scene is dated more than fourteen years later. The story then resumes, practically in the minutes, from the end of the first novel. We had seen in La Fortune that Eugène Rougon, made a man of the most powerful politics in Paris, brought his little brother Aristide, a journalist of no talent, of a comic character, incapable of deciding the imperial question in a comic way, thus left out of the rewards; and that he had followed him to Paris to appropriate the wealth and the power which he believes to be his. Eugene promises him these things, on condition that he keeps out of his way, and that he changes his name, in order to avoid the bad news of the scandals that might have sullied the reputation of Eugene. Aristide took the name of Saccard, and Eugène found him a job in the district, a very modest job. Saccard, no longer having a bad taste for his job, sees that he is able to know in advance the houses and the buildings which will be demolished to make room for the big new boulevards of Paris. Knowing that the owners of the houses demolished by the municipality receive rich indemnities, he gets money from usurers to buy them before their situation becomes public, and to make great profits by their sale. But he has not the means to do this at first, and his wife, in the next room, is dying of a fatal illness. Saccard, however, takes the opportunity, in a scene of sublime callousness, to marry the rich young woman, Renée, who is pregnant, and whose parents, to avoid a scandal, offer a dowry to the man who will marry her and make her his child. Saccard accepts, and his career of speculation begins. Her husband carries her off to Plassans, and sends his son Maxime to school in Paris, where we meet him when he has just come out of college and meets his new wife, only a few years older than himself. The flashback finished, the novel is placed in the background of the opulent house of Saccard, of his prodigality, of his luxuries, in the midst of a game of lust and politics. Renée and Maxime fall in love, which Saccard suspects, and seems to tolerate, perhaps because of the contract of commercial marriage that he had made with Renée. However, the house of Renée, the family estate, would be worth millions, and Renée refuses to sell it. The novel continues, the tension increases, and ends with a sequence of bitter reflections by Zola on the hypocrisy and immorality of the new rich. At the time of the publication of the Curé, he was a poor journalist, who had never seen such scenes. Ample notes, preserved in volumes, were taken on architecture, on fashion, on garden design, on greenhouse plants (a seduction takes place in Saccard's greenhouse), on cars, on carriages, on liveries. Then he brought his notes to the printing press, and many people praised the realism of his novel. In 1966, Jean Cau made an adaptation in contemporary Paris with Jane Fonda, Michel Piccoli and Peter McEnery. It was released in English as the End of the Game.",
    "The principal character is Beverley, who remembers his childhood days with his brother Felix and his cousins Félicité, Cecile, Dan, Sara Stanhope, and Peter, the hired man, and his friend Sara Ray. They spent a great deal of time in their orchard and had many adventures. We see the children grow up; we see especially Sara Stanhope move away from the golden highway of childhood. We see the beginning of the chemistry between Peter and Félicité, we even see a little bit of that between Beverley and Sara Stanhope, but it is not very important. During the whole of the story it is intimated that Beverley's cousin Cecile is consumptive. In the end the story tells us that she has never left the golden highway. She also tells us that Peter and Félicité are married. The story ends when Sara's father comes to take her away to educate her. Their little band is never complete again.",

    "Crystal, the only daughter of the exiled old royalist, the Count of Cambray, is to be betrothed to Victor de Marmont (secretly a fervent Bonapartist). And when the Englishman who loves Crystal and who questions Victor de Marmont, he replies that he has never deceived the Count, but that the Count had taken his political ideas for granted. Crystal, however, had a third admirer, Maurice de St-Genis, who, through the misfortune of his position, and his unsteady conduct, which her father regarded as a bad knout, deprived him of the right to her hand. But at the moment of the betrothal, Maurice derives the most bitter revenge on his rival. As soon as the assembly of the party was about to take place, there was a commotion in the corridor; Maurice de St-Genis stepped in, with his rough clothes and his muddy boots, which contrasted with the immaculate costumes of the Count’s guests. Beside himself with rage, and brandishing his cane, he cried that he had only come to avert the horrible catastrophe which threatened the Count and his family. At these ominous words, the Count turns pale, and asks what disaster can be more serious than twenty years of exile? “An alliance with a traitor, M. le Comte,” he replies. St-Genis then accuses his rival of having nailed Napoleon’s Proclamation to the walls of Grenoble; but instead of repudiating the charge, de Marmont takes a copy of the Proclamation from his pocket, and waving it about, cries, “Vive l’Empereur!” And although the abrupt rupture of the betrothal does not cause the ruin of Crystal’s heart, it is not St-Genis who gains her love, for it is the English merchant, Clyffurde, who, through his perseverance, eventually overcomes the prejudices of the old French count. Having promised never to buy nor sell gloves again, and to try and live like a gentleman, Clyffurde, laughing, asks Crystal’s aunt, “Do you think he will consent?”",
    "Duff Pringle, a new recruit in the high-tech industry, has just driven across the country for a job in the Valley, California. His old Ford Escort has not gone a hundred miles from his front door before it broke down. He calls a towing company to pick him up and when they reach the garage it takes three or four days to get it fixed. He only has two weeks to get to California. While waiting at a motel he finds a note asking for a driver to take a car to St Louis. Duff emails him, saying he’ll stay in the same motel, and the mechanic sends him the car. Then Duff finds Stu, a fellow waiting in the car park who’s trying to get to California and wants to come with him. Duff is prepared to take him, in spite of Stu’s looks and behavior. They drive the car, a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air, to St Louis to be delivered to Rosalie Hopgood, a businesswoman. A number of other people get involved in the story, such as Bonnie, an aspiring singer whose mother is a professional cheat (she’s a swindler, a major swindler who’s been sued for a lot of money and is on the run); two gangsters who are after a trunk full of money; and Moony, a terrier with a fear of cars.",
    "The Golden Notebook is a work of fiction by Anna Wulf, about her four notebooks, in which she records her life, and how she tries to gather them into a fifth, golden notebook. The Golden Notebook is composed of a fictional story about the lives of two women and their children, ex-husbands and lovers - under the title “Free Women” - interspersed with passages from Anna's four notebooks, coloured black (about her experiences in Southern Rhodesia before and during World War II, which inspired her novel), red (about her membership in the communist party), yellow (about the novel that Anna is now writing about the painful end of her love affair), and blue (her diary, where she records her thoughts, dreams and emotions). Every notebook is referred to four times, between which there are scenes from “Free Women”, so that a haphazard and non-chronological story develops. This post-modernistic form, with its spaces for ‘play’ for the characters and the reader, was one of the book's main features. But the serious themes in the novel were more important to the author.",
    "Summer 1944 in New York City. Although she has a successful psychiatric practice on Park Avenue, Dr. Charlotte Manning—young, beautiful, blond, and wealthy—is never satisfied. To increase her income, she takes in a criminal gang—a “consortium”—that is both a vice and a drug house. The brains of the operation is Hal Kines, who has had a plastic surgeon’s touch, which makes him look much younger than he is, and who thus attracts young women who he turns into whores. Manning herself specializes in treating the rich and genteel—people who would rather not have their addiction become public knowledge. Instead of helping them to get over their addictions in her private, exclusive clinic, she makes them more dependent on drugs—mostly heroin—and on herself, who provides them with the drug herself. Manning, who on the surface maintains her respectability as a world-renowned psychiatrist, falls in love with Myrna Devlin, a young girl who had become a junkie and whose suicide attempt he prevented, and brings her to Dr. Manning’s clinic for “treatment.” After she has been cured, she and Jack get engaged, and the Mannings keep in touch with them. He has long been suspicious of the ways of Dr. Manning and decides to go into the matter himself, in private, secretly. When he finds out that Hal Kines, a former college student whom she knew through her clinic and who had become a friend, is actually a criminal, he is forced to have an impromptu conversation with her about it and informs her of it. At a party given by Mr. Williams in his apartment, Dr. Manning sees some old yearbooks whose photographs, if made public, would expose Kines’s duplicity. In the course of the evening she goes home, but that same night, after her maid has gone to bed, she comes back to his apartment and shoots him in the stomach with a silenced pistol. She enjoys watching his agonizing death and takes the yearbooks with her. No one at the party has an absolutely reliable alibi for being in the apartment at the time of the murder, but neither Pat Chambers, the police inspector, nor Mike Hammer, a friend and fellow-investigator, can find a motive for the murder. Throughout the book, as one after another of the immediate suspects is eliminated (“If this keeps up, there’ll be no one left”), Hammer occasionally wonders if the murderer might not have been a “foreigner”—someone unknown to the group of people who had been at Mr. Williams’s party, perhaps one of the people whom he, Mr. Williams, had been investigating in his capacity as an agent of an insurance company. The police are soon forced to reject this idea, however. After examining the body (“I felt as if I wanted to cry for the first time in my life”), Mike Hammer vows to himself that he will find the murderer and will have him executed. He will not allow the justice system of the United States to touch the case. He knows that if he did, a clever lawyer would get him off, and the murderer would get away with his crime. So he will be the jury himself, and the judge himself. During their separate investigations Hammer and Chambers are, however, very close, and they constantly exchange information. Nevertheless, each of them hopes that he will be the one who will find the murderer first. The first suspects are Esther and Mary Bellemy, beautiful twin sisters living in a rented apartment in New York City. Both are well to do and live on a large country estate. Neither is married, and both are blatantly looking for a husband. He finds out, through personal experience, that Mary is a nymphomaniac. Esther, whom he never touches, is also not a virgin, but she is much more reserved than her sister, with whom he has relations on two different occasions. He also suspects George Kalekoi, who had been a crook—a bootlegger—but has apparently straightened out and is now Hal Kinze’s paternal friend, supporting him, paying his rent, and helping him with his tuition. , the “scion,” is the head of an organized crime syndicate dealing in drugs and prostitution. (In actual fact, it is the other way around. Hal Kines, the “scion,” and the brains of the outfit, has a document proving that George Kalekoi is a murderer.) The very sophisticated and complicated way in which he gets women for his gang is understandable only in the morally repressed society of the late 1940s. He passes himself off as a student named John Hanson, attending some college or other in a remote area—maybe in the midwest—pretends to fall in love with a female student, gets her pregnant, and forces her to have an abortion. Then he takes her to the university hospital and, in the midst of her suffering, has her sent home from college, shunned by the rest of the students, her family, and, more than likely, even by her friends. Then he has a car waiting, picks up the desperate young woman, and drives her to one of his “work houses” in New York City, from which there is no escape. To the outsider, such a girl seems the perfect nymph. Besides Mary, whom he knows through a friend, he falls in love with a fellow student, Charlotte Manning, who, to the best of his knowledge, had no motive for killing John Williams. And, sure enough, she soon confides her love for him, while he declares that he has never been in love before. Soon they are talking about getting married. It is only when she undresses at the end that he finds out that she is a real blonde. For the next five murders, after her first, she must hide her tracks and eliminate anyone who might expose her, and as M. HAMMER puts it, she is remarkably fortunate. There is also Myrna Devlin, a former “freak,” who, as it turns out, has no role at all except that of a victim. At the end of the book, when she is in the coatroom upstairs, trying on a fur coat, she finds a packet of heroin in it. Then Charlotte Manning shoots her, too. It takes Hammer and Chambers a long time to figure it all out. After Mary, Charlotte keeps on killing anyone who might be dangerous to her. All this takes place through Hammer’s eyes, and for a long time he is completely unaware of the facts (“I hope you catch him,” she says, sincerely). Then, while Charlotte is watching her friend’s child in Central Park, she and Hammer are shot at. But it doesn’t become known until later that it was Kalecki who shot at them. On a Saturday morning, he picks up Myrna Devlin, and they ride together to his apartment. Charlotte tells him that she has something to do and will come in time for a tennis match in the evening. After a few unsuccessful efforts to play tennis, Hammer spends the whole day in his room, asleep, with his old friend Junior beside him. It is only at dinner, when he is introduced to Harmon Wilder, Bellemy’s lawyer, and Charles Sherman, the lawyer’s assistant, that he has a distraction and learns that after Myrna Devlin is shot, Harmon Wilder and Charles Sherman disappear. It turns out that they had drugs on them and didn’t want to be caught. Mary Bellemy asks Charlotte if she can “borrow” Hammer, and she takes him into the woods, where they have an affair. They come back just as the maid finds Myrna’s body, which a maidservant has discovered, in a room upstairs, in front of a big mirror. Finally, after Pat Chambers and the police arrive, the guests’ alibis are checked, and once again, Charlotte is able to convince them that she could not have done anything. And once again, Hammer goes home and withdraws to his own apartment. Finally he realizes who the murderer is. He goes to Charlotte’s house, and there he remembers everything, and finally shoots her dead, even though she tries to shoot him.",
    "Ever since his release from a recent war in South-East Asia (in which he went by the names of “Easy” and “Flash”), the young man, Evelyn Cyril “Easy” Gordon (or “Flash” as he’s known for short) is considering what to do with his life. He’s thinking about spending a year travelling in France. An opportunity comes his way: he’s got a name that’s possibly a winner in the Irish lottery, but he’s also intrigued by an advertisement asking: ‘Are you a coward?’ He finally decides on the latter and learns that the advertiser is Star, a woman of great beauty he’d previously met on Levant Island. She says he’s the right man for a dangerous quest: he’s to seek the Phoenix egg. When she asks him what she’s to call him, he proposes Scar-Face, referring to the scar on his face, but she stops him as he’s about to say: ‘Scar-Face’ and corrects it to ‘Oscar’, thereby giving him his new name. Along with Rufo, a man who seems to be in his fifties, they travel the ‘Glorious Road’ and fight minotaurs, dragons and other strange creatures. Shortly before they set off in search of the Phoenix egg itself, Star and her husband marry. Then, they enter the tower in which the egg is hidden and are confronted by the most difficult obstacle course ever seen, full of optical illusions and trickery of every kind. When Oscar sends a message to the tower ahead of them, he’s attacked by a terrible opponent, a Cyrano-like character. He overcomes the final challenge of the egg’s final guardian, who’s only ever called the ‘Never-Born’, and the party escape with the egg. Rufo reveals that Star is actually an empress, the great-granddaughter of the emperor of many worlds. The egg is a cybernetic device that contains the experiences and knowledge of the vast majority of her forebears. In spite of her youth, she’s already had dozens of children, and is able to live much longer than is usual. Star has already been given the egg, and in a misguided moment of generosity, decides to give it to her husband as well. Initially, he’s overjoyed at his new position as the husband of the empress of the twenty universes, but eventually, he begins to feel lonely, useless and bored. Then, he asks Star for her advice and she tells him that he must leave, that there’s no place for him in her world and that he’ll have to go away alone. It’ll take her decades to share the knowledge in the egg with him, so he must go on his own. He returns to Earth and is astonished to find that the world has changed, though he brings back with him a fortune. But he begins to wonder whether he was ever there at all. In the end, he meets up with Rufo, who invites him to go with him on another journey on the Glorious Road, which has now become an allegory for the Journey of Life.",

    "The Israeli embassy in Rome is blown up by a bomb, and Israeli agents, known as the 'Office', are at a loss to explain the reasons for the attack. They uncover a CD containing highly secret information about Gabriel Allon, an Israeli assassin who is a legend. Not safe in the rest of the world, Gabriel returns to his country, dragging his Italian girlfriend, and fellow agent, Chiara Zolli, with him. Lev, the new director of the Office, has long been annoyed by the close relations that Gabriel maintains with Ari Shamron, the former director, and his recent clandestine activity in his name. He demands that Gabriel be formally attached to the Office, so that he can benefit from the protection of the other agents. However, Gabriel and Shamron feel that Lev wants to control and limit their activities. Lev orders Gabriel to remain in Israel and to direct the research group in which Yossi, Dina, Yaakov and Rimona will operate, in order to study the bombing in Rome and the possible connection with Gabriel. In her investigations, Dina links together a series of seemingly unrelated terrorist acts and attributes them to Khaled al-Khalife, a mysterious descendant of the Arab smugglers. Although he was adopted by Yasser Arafat as a child, Khaled was brought up abroad and did not become a visible member of the PLO. Dina thinks that, under a carefully created European identity, Khaled has arranged a series of acts of terror against Israel, and that the attack on the embassy is just one of them. All these attacks seem to commemorate the killing of the Palestine people, among them Khaled's father, Saber Khalife, founder of Black September. Dina thinks that another attack is imminent, and she expects an attack in commemoration of the fifty-year-old Israeli confiscation of Beit Saayid, Khaled's hometown. Readers learn that Khaled lives under the name of Paul Martineau, a prosperous French archaeologist, and that he carries out his attacks through an Arab partner in Marseilles. It is also discovered that the preparations for the next attack are already under way. The smuggler, Ari Shamron, who has just returned to Israel with his wife, Leah, and his Italian girlfriend, Chiara, asks Gabriel to disestablish his marriage to Leah and marry her, and at the same time, with his approval, to meet with Yasser Arafat and get information about Khaled. So Ari's son, Yonatan, escorts Gabriel to the Mukataa, Arafat's mansion. In spite of the fact that the two men are supposed to be enemies, Arafat agrees to the meeting, for Gabriel once saved his life. Gabriel, who sees through Arafat's evasions and lies, deduces that it was Khaled who planned the attack on the Israeli embassy. It also turns out that the arsonist, Tarek Hourani, worked for Arafat and that he was trying to kill Gabriel in the car bomb that killed his son and wounded Leah. Gabriel meets with Yaakov Avraham, a secret agent who has penetrated the PLO, and is informed by him that Khaled sends important messages to Arafat through a female agent in Egypt. Since the last telephone contact between them was from Cairo, Gabriel goes there. In Egypt he meets Mimi Ferrer, a charming and multilingual girl who fits the description of Khaled's partner, a woman whose telephone number is traced to Marseilles. Aboard the “Fidelity,” Gabriel assembles his team and carries out the operation of killing Khaled. But Khaled is already on to them, and before they know it they are on their way to Paris, to the Gare de Lyon, where the evildoer is going to detonate an explosive device. In the last moments, Gabriel kills two of the three suicide bombers and manages to rescue Leah. They return to Israel, but Mimi and Khaled manage to place photographs of Gabriel in the hands of the press and thereby connect him to the explosion. Although Leah, still suffering from mental shock, begins to communicate with Gabriel, she also leaves him and goes back to Venice. Gabriel finally tracks down and kills Khaled at an archeological dig in Provence. He returns to Israel and resumes his work as a restorer.",
    "Our story begins with Imriel, who has sat down to read the letters his mother, Melisande Shahrizai, has written him in all these years. After the incidents of Kushiel’s Scion, especially what happened with Canis in Lucca, he is concerned about where she is and what she is trying to do. Though the letters are not altogether comforting, they contain much information, and soothe away some of his unhappiness. His foster-mother, Phèdre nèe Delaunay, asks if he would like to talk about them, but he declines. When he presents himself to the queen, he tells her of his intention to marry the princess of Albion, Dorelei, whom he met when he was eighteen, when Prince Talorcan, Drustan’s nephew and heir, came to visit the city. Drustan would like to name Alais his heir, but he could not do so without risking a civil war. If Alais married Talorcan, she would rule at his side, but their children would not be able to inherit the throne, because the succession in Albion is according to the mother’s line. If Imriel marries Dorelei, his son would be Cruarch, and the influence of Terre d’Ange would be in no danger of failing. This is why he has agreed to marry her, for the sake of the kingdom. But at the same time he has found himself drawn to his cousin Sidonie de La Courcel. He knows that she is similarly drawn to him. However, he is still the son of two notorious traitors, and she is the dauphine. It is not possible that they could be together. Yet at the Midwinter Masque at the palace, he and Sidonie kiss. The only people who know of their affair are Sidonie’s maid, Amarante, and Imriel’s best friend, Mavros. They sometimes help them to meet in secret, and warn them if they are about to be surprised. Sidonie’s own private guards also know of it, but they are loyal to her. Maslin of Lyons is her chief guard, and also rumoured to be her lover. Since the wedding is to be arranged, Imriel begins to take lessons from Alais in the laws of Albion, history, religion and the finer points of the language. After this, he goes to Sidonie’s house and spends a few hours alone with her, often for the purpose of wooing her. She is annoyed that it has to be done in secret, but she lets it happen. One day, in the course of their savoury afternoon, Imriel tells Sidonie what happened to him at Drujan (Kushiel’s Avatar). She listens to him calmly, but with sorrow. Then she asks him whether he would still be willing to take advantage of her cruelty, because she would like to try it again. For once Imriel seems to be quite happy with the idea, so long as it was her doing. This goes on for many months, unknown to almost everyone. The wedding is getting closer, and Imriel begins to feel a growing despair. He and Sidonie both know that they are not to be together, and they find themselves yearning for each other even more because it is not allowed. To alleviate his despair, Mavros takes him again to the house of Valerian. But as they have had a drink beforehand, he books them a showing instead. It is a great idea, and it also helps Imriel to come to terms with his past and his Kushiel heritage. The following summer, in the spring, Prince Talorcan and Princess Dorelei accompany Drustan on his annual visit to Terre d’Ange. However, Imriel is distracted by his love for Sidonie. But he agrees to marry Dorelei, for, as Sidonie said, they love each other because they cannot be together. Besides, she is not yet eighteen, so she cannot go against her mother’s wishes. Moreover, she cannot know any true happiness with Imriel. Imriel is, however, very sad to leave her. Dorelei, sensing that Imriel is not really hers, is prepared to share him, as she knows the Angelines do, but she will be only with him, as is the Albion custom. Imriel is touched, but assures her that there is no one else. Imriel and Sidonie meet, as before, at an Elua temple. The priest vows to keep their secret and counsels them to cease from such secret meetings and refrain from continuing in a love affair which will inevitably cause others to be hurt. But he does give them a private room for one last meeting. On the night of the meeting, Mavros takes him on a stag party. Imriel is in a wild and desperate mood, just the right one for the house of Valerian. Mavros is careful to make sure that Imriel is not too excited and is in control. The next day they are married in a very public ceremony. Many important people come to the wedding, but the most precious of the gifts is from Drustan’s family: the ‘abdal’, a bangle carved with the eagle, the family crest (daidh-anam). Imriel is now fully a member of the royal family. He carries himself with deference, but inside he feels numb and sad. He is in a fever, he feels sick, and Sidonie is there to see him married to another woman. On the wedding day, Sidonie throws rose petals over the couple. Imriel knows what it means, for a person surrounded by love, sorrow and sadness, has no way of covering himself with the fragrance of flowers. The others at the wedding are so happy that his inner turmoil seems all the more tragic, though it is well hidden. Imriel and Princess Dorelei have sexual relations that night, because Princess Dorelei wants to have a child and has invoked the name of Esh. In the following days, Imriel admits to Princess Dorelei that he loves someone else. She knows, but she understands that they have married for political reasons. Eamonn comes to the court from Skandia, having made peace with his Skandia bride’s family. Imriel tells Eamonn about his affair with Sidonie. The expedition to Scotland is about to leave when Sidonie returns from her pilgrimage to the Temple of Naima. She and Imriel arrange to meet in the Temple for a last meeting before he leaves. In the morning, Imriel departs for Alba with a large escort of the D’Angeline family, Drustan’s family, Phèdre n Delaunay and Joscelin Verreuil. After the wedding, Imriel travels with Princess Dorelei’s family to Cluny, the new home of the Prince, on the paths (taisgaidh) over which no one is allowed to attack, raid or fight, paths on which all of the people of Alba can travel. His mind is full of Sidonie and he pleasures himself, spilling his seed on the ground. But in his sleep, he wakes up, with an irresistible desire for lust and a driving urge to pleasure. He gets up and follows it. This takes him to a solitary, married woman, Morwen, who tries to rule him and tries to make him have a child with her. The power of her seduction is strong, and though he tries to resist, she has gained possession of him. Suddenly some of the men of his escort come up and drive the woman away. The men tell him that he has been very stupid. The devil, they say, ensnared him by spilling his seed, which is full of his lust and love, on the common earth. She has been able to make a mannequin of him which she can use whenever she wants. The power of the spell is great, and the only way to release himself is to go to an ollamh, a kind of religious druid. The ollamh also casts a spell on him, binding his limbs with red ribbons, and he must wear a croonite stone round his neck to protect him. If any of these is taken off or broken, the spell will be broken and he will again be under the woman’s control. Now he feels a lightness of being which he has not known for months. He is still possessed by his passions, but he does not seem to be as sad as before. He can now give himself to Princess Dorelei. She, on the other hand, has lost her vision of the future, as if it were covered by a great grey cloud. Nonetheless, Cluny is a peaceful place, as befits the home of an aristocrat, full of people who are the salt of the earth. He soon becomes friendly with his escort and his men, who though they do not know him, treat him with respect. A neighbouring chief, Leodan of Briclaedh, thinks he is weak and wants to steal his cattle and horses. Imriel, to everyone’s surprise, sets a robbery for him before he can challenge him. The robbery is done just for fun and without any danger, only to prove how worthy the challenger is. Imriel escapes from many attackers with little harm, winning the respect of everyone and gaining the friendship of Urist, a man of good reputation and much liked by his troops. To the ecstasy of it all, Imriel rides home with his escort, feeling very happy that at last he has been accepted and respected not for his birth but because he has proved himself. But then he again begins to feel the power of the woman’s lust. Then suddenly he finds himself on a path among the trees, into a clearing where she is waiting. He tries to resist, but his body yields to her desire. But before anything further happens, they are disturbed, and he finds that one of the red cords has been cut. Before even attending the feast, he has the magic done again. And life goes on as it will in a castle of Alba. Imriel and Princess Dorelei manage to live in a kind of working relationship and with a love that is not too strong. With all his respect for her and all his kindness towards her, he is ultimately still caught up in his own personal thoughts and feelings, though for the most part he is able to forget about Sidonie. Also, Princess Dorelei is now pregnant and Imriel can hardly wait for his child to be born. Then he truly loves her, and his wonder at the life that she is bearing is filled with beauty. The cousin of Imriel, Alais, also grows and matures at Cluddread. She has been learning the art of the ollamh, and she is now greatly fond of it. Though she does not love Talorcan, she does not close her doors to him and does not refuse him. Then, one night, a letter comes for him from Sidonie. She writes to say that she still loves him, in spite of the distance. Athough she is sorry that they can never be together, she asks him to stay in Alba for at least the first year. Princess Dorelei had agreed that if he was unhappy, after the first year, he could leave her and go to Terre d’Ange. They could be like Drustan and Isandre, meeting each other only half the year, or less. Having read this letter, Imriel is stunned to find himself feeling so little emotion. He cannot even remember Sidonie’s face, and has no thoughts or feelings for her. So he decides to risk it. I am putting the croonie stone around my neck, he thinks, and when I read the letter to him, I’ll have it. He puts it around his neck, and reads the letter. And then, he is filled with both sadness and love. He misses her terribly, and still loves her. Then he puts the croonie stone around his neck again, and goes back to bed with Dorelei. In the spring Princess Dorelei is quite swollen, and they are both excited about their first child, which will soon be born. But, though they are both very happy together, Imriel’s love for Sidonie still dominates him, and he often thinks about Sidonie, though he always cares for and loves her. A few days after the Feast of Fools, however, Morwen appears from the forest in front of Cluddread’s men. She is still on the taisgaidh, but demands to see Imriel. Imriel meets her, with all his guards, the ollamh, Alais and Princess Dorelei, who is insistent on accompanying him. Then, having let him see his future, she gives him his mannekin stone. The taisgaidh is not far from here. Imriel doesn’t trust her, but she says that if he wishes to bring his men, they must stay outside the circle. – She agrees, without hesitating, that she will not harm Imriel, or any of his family. And she is willing to give him till sunset to make up his mind. Imriel and Dorelei talk it over, and by nightfall they have decided on their own. he will go alone to the taisgaidh with a large party of men, and will be cautious. Princess Dorelei will not risk her child’s life or her own by accompanying him, and will stay in Cluddread with the rest of the guard. Though it is a dangerous thing to do, it will be worth it for Imriel’s freedom, and for Dorelei’s visions, and for their unborn child. A-nel is the name they choose, for a son, and An-ielle for a daughter. So, that evening, Dorelei helps Imriel to put on his armour and prepare for the encounter. At the beginning of the taisgaidh’s road, Morwen is waiting. She leads him to the taisgaidh. It is dark, and although Imriel’s men carry torches, the circle has a sinister look about it. Then Morwen tells him that he is not allowed to wear any metal inside the circle, and that the lights must be extinguished. He asks why, and she merely replies that that is how the magic works. To be certain of his safety, he insists that she speak with the ollamh first. Then Morwen and the ollamh enter the circle. I swear by the stone, and the sea, and the sky, and all the gods of Alba, and by the diadh-anam of Maghuin Dhonn. If I lie, let my spell be broken, and my life forfeited. I swear by all men and women; let my name be as poison on the tongues of all; let the gods and the diadh-anam betray me, and let the earth’s feet mock me for ever! Is the ollamh satisfied? Then he steps out of the circle, and Morwen, after removing his shoes, leads him into the taisgaidh. She appears to raise a stone, takes her things from under it, and sets it down again behind her. On the stone table, she takes a cup of tea, which she drinks herself, then offers it to Imriel. He asks what it is. She replies that it is the tea of a mushroom, a gift of the earth. She picks up the stone knife, and the leather bag, and passes them to him, so that he can feel the manakin inside it. She also cuts the fetters round his wrists, and as he does so, his mind is flooded with memories, thoughts and emotions. Then Morwen cuts her wrists too, and puts her hands on his. As they wait, the effects of the tea begin to show. The stones, he thinks, are talking to him. He sees his unborn son, Aniel, holding on to him. He sees the dead Dorelei, holding Aniel, but it is too late. He sees his son with Alais, and then as a teen, he is angry at Urist. Then the apparitions fade, and Morwen speaks to him: ‘You have been out of Alba for too long, and you have seen too much.’ He goes back, and Morwen sees his sly wits, his delight in inciting quarrels and fights; and it is these that lead to the battles of the Ulstermen, and Talorcan’s death. He is then made a king, and brings with him armies of the d’Angeline clans, and conquers the country. He sees the women and children forcibly taken from their homes, and their dwellings burnt down. He sees Aniel murder a wounded man who begs for his life. Aniel burns the sacred groves and the stone circles. He is a fearless and cruel leader, and when the Maghuin Dhonn are all evicted, he rebuilds Bryn Gorrydum as a d’Angeline city. Finally, he begs her to stop, and she lets his hands go. ‘Your son is a monster, Imriel.’ He asks why, and she says that she doesn’t know, and she has not seen the future, except what she has seen already. Before her second child is born, Dorelei will die. When Aniel was first conceived, there was her daughter and his, to balance Aniel; now, there is nothing left except this. ‘And all because you interfered in this matter?’ asks Imriel. ‘Yes,’ says Morwen, with a deep sadness. Imriel sees her failings, as the horns grow and chime together. He knows that the wounds were deeper than he thought, and is horrified. Morwen has lied, and the whole family will be cursed. Her life is to be sacrificed to the well-being of the Maghuin Dhonn. He turns and runs, still in the haze of the tisane. The gates of the castle are open, for Leodan of Briclaedh has set his own cattle-raid on this night, when the d’Angeline host is elsewhere. An enormous bear tries to enter the castle. Imriel tries to slay him, but he snatches at him with a great claw, and falls to the ground. After a while, Imriel comes to, and sees Dorelei lying on a table. She is dead. He is badly clawed. He is taken back to Bryn Gorrydum and treated by an ei-Sandine. Alais visits him most days, but vengeance is what keeps him alive. He wishes Berlik dead. The hunt for Berlik in Alba fails, but Hyacinthe, Lord of the Isles, sees a large bear swim across the straits to Azzalle. He cannot be sure it was Berlik, but Imriel is. He vows to bring back Berlik’s head and bury it where he buried Dorelei’s feet. Urist swears to help him, and many of the ei-Sandine come to his aid. When Imriel is well enough, he tells Drustan, and with Alais’s blessing, he sets off for Terre d’Ange. When he and Urist arrive in Azzalle, Imriel tells Urist that it was not in his bosom, or his eyes, or his mind, that he loved but one. And even though Urist is aghast, he swears himself to Imriel’s service. The whole entourage sets off for Elua, full of love and the desire to hunt down Berlik. When they reach the castle, Imriel goes straight to Sidonie, and falls on his knees before her, embracing her round her waist. Ysandre comes in and spits with anger. Sidonie has come from the royal chambers to see him, and then embraces him in her chaste courtly way, and shows him her deepest love. Mavros gives the Shahrizai lands on the outskirts of the city, to keep Imriel and the ei-Sandine out of the town. She refuses to be hurried, saying that she is a grown woman, now that she has reached the age of discretion, and that she may love whomsoever she will. Imriel learns that Phèdre and Joscelin have still not returned from their mysterious journey. He visits their home and has a pleasant visit with all who lived there. In the end he is able to gather up all the supplies and money he needs, and even takes some from the king’s own coffers, which is just what Ysandre wants. He and the ei-Sandine make their way northwards through the Pashkan plains, to the new country of Vralia. From there they take a ship to the capital of Vralia, following Berlik’s track. After being lost on an island for a whole month, they finally arrive in Vralgrad. But Urist is so ill that he has to stay in Vralgrad. Imriel follows the track of Berlik southwards, as far as the small town of Tarkov. There he has the misfortune to be there when a Tartar raid takes place. Seeing the scars from his misadventures in Darshangan, they think he is a spy for the Tartars and throw him in prison. He spends some time there, alone with one other prisoner. and so escapes. And he leads his Tartar companion to his freedom so that he can return to the woman he loves. And then he follows the long-deserted track of Berlik, or so he thinks it is Berlik’s track. At a small Yeshuaian temple in Miroslas, the most secluded part of the land, he learns that Berlik stayed there for some time in his search for forgiveness. He is warned not to go searching for Berlik there and he goes, despite their admonitions, and continues his search in the wilds of Miroslas, spending days and nights, as he does, in silence, in loneliness, in the apparent futility of his search. He sends his horse away, hoping to reach it alive in some warm stable, for he is starving. But just when he is beginning to think that he must turn back before he too dies of hunger, Berlik leaves him a sign. And Imriel follows the signs, and finally finds the hut Berlik had built and where he now lived. There is a ramskull skull in the hut, and a cross with an ember in it. Here Berlik comes to him. Humble and broken, he asks for death, because he knows that he can only find salvation in the arms of Imriel. I’ve prayed, I’ve prayed that the Diadh-anam might grant my prayer and allow me to redeem my people, if you found me. I felt this in the heart of the forest when my gift came back to me. Imriel asks him why he was so harsh with him. he would not have come to you in such humility, he says. He admits his wrongs and his fears, that he should have trusted in the Yeshuaian gods more than in himself, and that he had to have your salvation to be able to give it. He begs Imriel’s pardon, and calls him his avenger. In that moment, when Imriel raises his sword, he knows that he loved too well those he had to avenge. Imriel says: “I am sorry,” and then, weeping, cuts off Berlik’s head. He stays a day at Berlik’s hut, to gather food and supplies, and then leaves for his distant home. And as he walks on and on, he hears voices speaking in his tongue, and D’Angeline, and he knows that they are not come to help him. The soldiers of Tarkov have come to capture him. The D’Angeline is Maslin, a warrior from Lombelon, sent by Sidonie to find Imriel. Imriel and Maslin fight off the soldiers, and in doing so they overcome their former rivalry. Maslin has been edified by his travels as well, and in the forest he prepares a stew for Berlik’s head. Imriel wants to do it himself, but Maslin refuses. They go on together. They go back to Tarkov. but Tarkov is the nearest landing-place for the ferries that go to the cities, and so is their nearest route home. In Tarkov, however, they find Phèdre and Joscelin, who had come to seek Imriel and join him on his journey. Phèdre is arguing with the guards, trying to explain that he is the royal prince of the land of the Angels, not a Tartar. They don’t believe her, but they don’t wish to fight, and “permit” them to go on their way. Joscelin is met by his former pupil, Micah ben Ximon, who has since taken over the leadership of the Yeshuaites, and is now one of King Vral’s closest advisors. When the weather begins to improve, they cross back to the plains, and go to Azalla. They return to Terra D’Ange, where everyone is glad to hear they have come. Imriel goes to Sidonie. (This material is from the paperback edition of Kushiel’s Justice, which includes an additional, supplementary chapter, but is the final one.) The Queen has calmed down considerably, but cannot approve of the relationship, because of Imriel’s parents. But she cannot renounce it, because to do so would be to deny the precept of Elua. Imriel, Sidonie, Phèdre, Joscelin and the entire party of the Lombelons go back to Cluny to bury Berlik’s head, as Imriel has promised. Then they return to the City of Elua. They are greeted by a large number of people with black armbands. These are the people who have been the victims of the machinations of Melisande and Benedicte (see Kushiel’s Grace).",
    "The piece is situated in a world of rock-music and violence in a vaguely sci-fi future; a rocking game, played by the ‘Markers’ under the control of the ‘Keepers’, where Hoss has fought his way up to the top, only to have to deal with unofficial opposition from ‘Gypsies’ who play outside the system. Act I. Hoss has his mind set on going out for a bit of fun and is dejected when the Starman advises him to give it a miss, based on astrology. Hoss then learns that his rival, Mojo Root Force, has snatched some of his Las Vegas territory in a move that is far from legal. When he gets word that a gypsy is on the way to attack him, Hoss calls his old friend Little Willard for help but finds that Willard has committed suicide, because he couldn’t take the pressure of being his brother. All these revelations further increase Hoss’s depression and his belief that the old way of doing things is dying out. He seeks to cheer himself up by challenging the gypsy to a shiv fight. Act II. In the build-up to the duel (which has been changed from a shiv fight to a verbal battle, under the control of a referee), Hoss and the gypsy try to figure each other out. Crow learns Hoss’s walk and mannerisms, while Hoss tries to intimidate him by speaking in the voice of an old-time gunslinger. However, despite an apparently successful second round, in which he adopts the voice of a blues-singer from the Mississippi Delta, Hoss loses the battle when Crow exploits Hoss’s “fear of being cut in two”. Having killed the referee, Hoss is desperate to learn how to do things the new way, but instead commits his final act of rebellion by killing himself, for which Crow is impressed. At the end, Crow takes Hoss’s place as King, and the loyal Becky defects.",
    "The Emersons are still in England, aching to go back to Egypt; but there seems to be no excuse for them to go back, until Lady Baskerville asks them to finish the work of her husband, who mysteriously died while working on a tomb at Luxor. No one else will undertake the work, as rumours of the infamous curse hang over the whole valley. Leaving their son Ramses behind, they reach the Baskervilles’ farm, at the Valley of the Kings, where they find feverish workmen, dogged reporters, and a host of odd characters, all wanting to enter the tomb, or to prevent the Emersons from entering it.

    "It so happened that the stranger was Bevan of Eubaricon, son of the High King of the Isle and Celwony, the Goddess of the Moon. His arrival brought both hope and a threat to Cuin and Ellid, and to the mortals they represent. The Isle would surely benefit from a High King to keep the warring lords together. But at the same time, Bevan’s presence stirred up Pel, an ancient evil spirit, who began to snare the mortals in his hunt for an army of the dead, using the Orre’s Tower. Ellid fell in love with Bevan and ended her relationship with Cuin. And in turn, after being rescued from Pel’s priests, Cuin became Bevan’s apprentice. Bevan believes that his destiny is to give the Orre’s Tower back to the gods, so that they may renew their immortality. On the way, Cuin finds out that he is the heir to an ancient kingdom, older than Pryce’s dominions. In order to end the quest, Cuin must defeat the guardians of the kingdom, win back the magic sword and rally the lords of the Isle against Pel and his evil armies. Cuin and Bevan win the great victory, but in the end, the Orre’s Tower is lost and thus the gods are no more in the world of mortal men. Bevan is crowned High King and marries Ellid. But when Cuin is absent on a mission for a lord, his escort fails and almost kills him. And then Bevan comes to his rescue, but because of his foreseen role in a prophecy, he does not want to remain amongst men. Ellid and Cuin have to watch as Bevan prepares to leave, and as they do so, they find that they love each other. Bevan gives Ellid to Cuin to marry, but says he will never return to the Isle, although he prophesies the names of future kings and protectors of the land.",

    "Tirant the White recounts the adventures of a medieval knight of Brittany, who goes to seek adventures throughout Europe. He competes in jousts in France and England, and is recruited to assist the Byzantine Emperor against the Turks, a savage tribe of Muslim invaders who threaten the capital of the empire, Constantinople. He defeats them and saves the empire from destruction. Later, he fights against the Turks in many places in the eastern Mediterranean and in North Africa, but dies before he can marry the fair heiress of the Byzantine Empire.

    "The book is written from the point of view of a ten-year-old boy, who lives on a planet which has been snatched away from the sun by a passing black star and whose atmosphere, deprived of heat, has been frozen into a deep layer of “snow.” His father had been working with a group of scientists on a gigantic underground habitation, but the earthquakes which had accompanied the catastrophe had destroyed the habitation and killed everyone. He had managed to build a smaller, more primitive habitation for his family, called the “Nest,” where they maintained a breathing atmosphere by occasionally fetching pails of oxygen from outside and melting it over a fire. This is how they survived for several years until they were found by a search party sent out by the Los Alamos colony, where they used atomic heat to keep warm and had started using rockets to search for other survivors (radios, which cannot function long distances because there is no ionosphere). They discover that other groups of people have survived in the Argonne, Brookhaven, Harwell, and Tuva colonies and that plans are underway to start uranium mining in the Great Slave Lake or the Congo.

    "They are left by their owners, the Hunters, who have gone to England for a few months, where the master, Jim Hunter, has a lecture course to attend. They entrust their animals to John Longridge, a family friend and the godfather of their daughter, Lizabeth. One day, John Longridge goes away for two weeks on a duck-hunting expedition, and the animals, feeling themselves deprived of human companionship, set off to look for their owners. Mrs Oakes, who is looking after Longridge’s house, is unable to find the animals, and thinks John must have taken them away with him. The animals follow their instincts, and set off for home, which is nearly three hundred miles away. Luath: Luath is a young black Labrador. His coat is rusty-gold in colour, his eyes are brown, and he is strong and powerfully built. He is the most recent of the three animals, and is the most loyal and brave of the three. He is also the most anxious to reach home and the Hunters. Luath walks at Bodger’s left, guiding him, as the latter is nearly blind in his left eye. He is the one who suffers the most from lack of food, because a porcupine’s quills have entered him in the face, and the wounds have become infected and make it difficult for him to open his mouth. Bodger: Bodger (his full name is CH. Burough-Castle Brigadier of Doune) is an English Bull-Terrier. His coat is white, with a tinge of pink, and he is the heaviest and most powerful of the three. Bodger’s left eye is almost blind, but this does not stop him, for he is a dog born to fight and endure. At eleven years old, he is easily tired, but is a brave, loyal, tenacious and persevering friend. He is fond of people, especially children, and on their travels he makes every effort to win affection and food from them. He is fiercely hostile to all cats except Tao, whom he respects because, as a kitten, he had the courage to stand up to him. Though he is very fond of Luath, Bodger is particularly fond of Tao, and their friendship is deep and strong. Bodger was the first to join the Hunters’ family. Although now a little grey, he is as brave and tenacious as ever, and has already defended Luath against a charging Border Collie when a farmer was furious that he had been chasing the cats. Tao: Tao is a slender seal-point Siamese cat with sapphire eyes. Unlike Luath, he never complains about being hungry. It is amusing to see him walking side by side with Bodger, for he too detests other cats, and has spent much time with him in terrorizing the neighborhood. On their travels, he often has to fight other domestic cats. His other special talents include the ability to open most doors, which is useful to the dogs. He is the most energetic and the most daring of the three. The only animals that are better adapted than he to live in the wild, though he is still always looking to join the two dogs. He is an excellent natural hunter and catches small birds to feed the whole family. When he is separated from the other two, it is the dogs who suffer most from his absence. Whether they survive without him, he seems to know, and his presence is essential to their well-being. John Longridge: John Longridge is Elizabeth Hunter’s godfather. He lives in a village some three hundred miles from the university town in which the Hunters live, in a stone house. He is a writer of historical books and a bachelor. The Hunter family consists of a mother, a father and two children, a boy of eleven and a girl of nine. The father, Jim, is the only one who owns a dog, Luath, while the children, Peter and Elizabeth, own Tao and Bodger. The mothers, Mrs. Oakes and Mrs. Hulme, care for the three animals while John is away. The husband, Bert, is a builder. The children, Peter and Liz, are of the boarding-school ilk. When Helvi, a ten-year-old girl, finds Tao at the bottom of the canal unconscious, she takes him home to be cared for by her father. The Mackenzies: James and Nell Mackenzie are an elderly couple who now live alone, since all eight of their children have grown up and left home. It is they who find a home for Bodger and Luath.",
    "The first part of the novel consists of four chapters under the title Questions. Chapter one: Chagoo is threatened by Khan who believes that Chagoo has been questioning him in order to gather evidence for the police. Chapter two: Dr Gauri Subba Rao contemplates challenging Chagoo and asking him to reveal the truth about her past. She is afraid that he knows everything. Chapter three: Dr Ram Mahipal talks to his medical students about the importance of questions. At the same time he is dreading his own career being destroyed by a single question. Chapter four: Professor Phatrapakar dreads being ruined by Ram Mahipal’s question, the answer to which Chagoo already knows. The preface ends. The main part of the novel begins with the title Answer. The commissioner informs Chagoo that a certain criminal named Abdul Khan has been supplying the film stars with narcotics from the Mira Bhayan Institute. The commissioner asks Chagoo to find out who is stealing narcotics from the institute and arrest them for some false reason so that the news does not spread and become public knowledge. Chagoo informs the commissioner that he has nabbed an air hostess, a Ms. Costa, who is supplying narcotics to Khan. The commissioner tells Chagoo that he will get another officer to handle Ms. Costa and that it will take a better officer than him to bring Khan to justice. Chagoo is told to question Asha Rani, a film star. Her ‘friend’ Mr. Ganguly had tried a certain narcotic called A.C.E. and nearly died. Khan was supplying the A.C.E. to him, as he had been supplying him with cocaine. Ghote questions Professor Phatrapakar at the institute. He says that he will go to any extent to protect the institute. The work of the institute is to extract venom from poisonous snakes and make it into narcotics. Subba Rao suspects that it is Ghote who stole the A.C.E. from the institute. He takes Ghote to the venom room. Subba Rao is found dead in the venom room with a Russell’s viper having got loose. The next day the commissioner asks Ghote to investigate the death of Chagoo himself so that the murder does not come to light. Ghote comes to the conclusion that he did not have the key to lock the venom room, and that someone must have murdered him. Dr. Ram Mahipal had suddenly left the job of Assistant Director and left his office key. Ghote gets to know from the building manager that Dr. Subba Rao had returned to the institute on the evening he was murdered. On the other hand, it is also known that he was working at a hospital, and this gives Ghote the idea that the murderer could be an employee of the hospital. So he sends Inspector Abhyankar, who had been investigating Chagoo’s death, to the hospital. Ram Mahipal has now come to Bombay for the first time since his arrival from Karachi. Phatrakar had a deep dislike for Mahipal. Mahipal had suspected Phatrakar of falsifying test results. Phatrakar is insensitive when questioned about Chagoo’s death and says that he had seen no reason to remove him. The professor shows some embarrassment on learning that he has been accused, but admits that he used to tamper with the results. Ghote suspects that the professor is trying to save his skin by blaming Ram Mahipal. Mahipal’s father is a cook in the medical school and he had said that he was a Vaishya. Ghote now asks Mahipal whether he had told the truth. Mahipal denies this and says that he had resigned because Phatrakar used to kill the animals which gave unsatisfactory results. He tells Ghote that he had left the job because the man was mistreating the animals. At the police station one of the inspectors says that one of the three scientists must be hanged, and his suspicion is that it will be Subba Rao. Phatrakar is arrested at the institute, and he admits that he had faked his results. He had caught Chagoo stealing and was about to fire him, but had been stopped because Chagoo had discovered that Phatrakar was removing animals. The wooden stool which had been used to break the window is inspected. There are some fresh finger prints on it. While this is going on, Ghote receives a message from the commissioner that Nicky D’Costa has been found murdered. Finger prints on the stool do not match any of the three suspects. There is also no proof that the stool was used to break the window. At home, Ghote argues with his wife. There is no security at the institute at night. He finds that the guard had caught Subba Rao in the act of stealing and had to be released by his colleague. Afterwards, Ghote talks to Subba Rao. He discovers that she was influenced by Phatrakar, who himself had been influenced by his uncle. On their way home, the coffin of the murdered girl is borne past by the carriage. Ghote tells her how the boy had been murdered and proceeds to question her. Subba Rao says that there was a boy called Abid Khan at the hospital recently, but Ghote is certain that he was not the murderer. She had made up the result of her experiment. Subba Rao was acquitted. Then Ghote suspects that she is the murderer. He remembers that he had seen the body lying face down, and the medical examiner had not come to the station. He suspects that Phatrakar is not strong enough to have strangled Chagoo. Dr Mahipal’s arm was deformed, so he is also ruled out. On his return to the police station, Ghote sees the police inspector of the Scientific Department. The inspector of fingerprints says that he had taken the samples of the suspects only. Abid Khan’s file had not been there. The inspector says that he cannot prove anything. Then he recalls the commissioner’s words, “It will take a better detective than you to prove that Abid Khan is the murderer.” Ghote arrests Abid Khan and charges him with murder.",
    "Soraya, Kavi and Jianan have agreed to work together to defeat the Hrum and free the people of Farsala. But Kavi's distrust of the two young men stands in the way of their common goal. The three try to work together, but it becomes difficult. They have only a few months left before the deadline set by the Hrum for the conquest of Farsala. The three young people learn that Garren, the strategus who has control of the conquest, has more than Farsala at heart. His father, a senator in the Empire of Hrum, has bragged that Garren would conquer Farsala with ten thousand troops. If this is not done, his father has bragged, he will resign his post. He has done this to secure the position for his son. Garren's enemies, in the Senate, are keen to see him fail. When Garren asks for money to buy Kadeshi soldiers, so that he may overcome the law forbidding the use of foreign troops, the Senate sends a commission to inspect the progress of the conquest. Kavi, Jianan and Soraya, then, decide to capture the gold, before it can be given to the Kadeshis, for a Kadeshi warlord has told Jianan that, if he paid the money, he would turn his soldiers against the Emperor, which would cause the greatest chasm in his father's force. Kavi and Soraya do not want this to happen. They talk to the pirates, and persuade them to attack the Senate commission when it arrives at the port of Dugaz. They hope that if they attack the commission, it will show the Senate that Garren has not secured control of the country. But when they arrive at the hideout of the pirates, they find that the commission arrived a week ago, and the pirates have not succeeded in robbing it. In return for his release, Kavi and Soraya promise that they will get the Suud to find a cure for the swamp sickness which has been killing the pirates. The gold is carried under Garren's own supervision to Setesafon. Then, after he has been given disguise and weapon, the young people set out for the city of Dugaz, which lies on the road to Setesafon. In disguise, Kavi tries to find out the password for the treasury, but is arrested. But before he is arrested, he has burnt the password on his saddle. This, Jianan and Soraya find. After the treasury is opened, the gold is thrown into the river. When the gold is found to be missing, Kavi is tortured, but he endures. Then he is publicly dragged in front of the soldiers, and told to fight Garren. Fasal, seeing the danger Kavi was in, challenges him to a duel, and slays Garren. Then the Persians riot, and Soraya, with a bolt of lightning, kills Garren. The Suud go away, leaving Kavi in charge of the country. Then they invite delegates from the other tribes to come and discuss the question of a league with the Hrum. After this, Jianan is invited to join the Hrum in their next campaign, against Kadesh. Soraya wishes to go with them.",

    "The disappearance of Dr. Pettifer from his lectureship at the University of Bath ought not to have involved many people, least of all retired Treasury clerical agent Tim Cranmer. But when, one Sunday evening, police officers came to see him at his country house and vineyard in Somerset, it brought up memories from the secret and recent past. Pettifer, it transpires, had been a field agent of the British Secret Service during the Cold War, and for a period of some twenty years Cranmer had been his boss. But now the Cold War was over, the Berlin Wall had fallen, and SIS had retired Cranmer and his field agent Pettifer to the country, where Pettifer was teaching at the University of Bath, and Cranmer was content to live on his inheritance, a country estate in Somerset, growing wine and indulging his beautiful young mistress, Emma. Not satisfied with remaining a recluse in Bath, however, Pettifer now began to come to Honeybrook, and became an ever-present companion in their lives. At least, that was so until both Pettifer and Emma disappeared. Disturbed by the police visit, Cranmer contacted his former colleagues at SIS and was called to London, where he discovered that Pettifer had disappeared with £37,000, obtained from a former Russian spy with the help of a former German field agent. Cranmer, suspected by the police in Bath, and later by SIS, conceived a desire to find out what had become of his protégé and his former mistress. But why should a philistine and an impractical man like Pettifer, a man who had no real interest in money, have stolen £37 million from the Russians? Cranmer now had to seek out old friends and acquaintances, both in Oxford and in the armaments trade, in order to find out what the former field agent and his former mistress might have been up to in their disappearance. He also visited his secret SIS archives, stored in the deserted church of St James the Less, bequeathed to him by the same uncle Bob who had left him Honeybrook. Having discovered there, and then dug up the hidden files, Cranmer discovered that Pettifer had been involved in a plot with a man called Konstantin Checheyev, formerly a Russian field agent who had claimed to be working for the Russians during the Cold War. Checheyev, it turned out, was not a Russian at all, but an Ingush from the high Caucasus, who resented the Russians’ expulsion of him and his people from their ancient homeland. The Ingush were now primed for a war of liberation against their oppressors, and it was Checheyev who was to provide them with the weaponry. Cranmer now set out on a journey that took him first to an arms dealer in Macclesfield, where he discovered that he and his assistants had been killed by an Ossetian group known as ‘The Wood’; next to Paris, where Emma had taken refuge; then to Russia, to renew his acquaintance with his former Soviet contacts in the hope of locating Pettifer; and finally to Ingushetia, to find his old friend and save him from the Russians, the Ossetians and himself.",
    "The novel is the story of Jack Ryan, a process server in Detroit who has a reputation for finding people who do not want to be found. A string of unrelated crimes leads to the search for a missing stockholder who has the reputation of being a no-man. This man is not unknown to everyone. A pretty blonde despises him and a crook by the name of Virgil Royal is after him. And this is the bad news for Jack. He is suddenly caught up in a triple murder plot, and is as much the target as his nameless quarry. The story is told with frequent confrontations between Jack and the police, among them the six-shooter-wielding Dick Speed. But the book is perhaps best remembered for a scene straight out of The Godfather, in which Virgil Royal plants a shotgun at the meeting place of his victim—in this case the fire escape leading up to the hotel room where the victim is supposed to be. Then there is the gay would-be gangster Lonnie, whose superfly haircut was copied by other characters in Elmore Leonard’s books.",
    "An old, droll story, Gremlins and the British Air Force, is the plot of the book, a fairy tale about the mischievous little gnomes called Gremlins, which the British Air Force has referred to as the cause of all its accidents and unforeseen disasters. The Gremlins in the book have sabotaged the British planes in revenge for the destruction of their forest home, which has been razed to make way for an aircraft factory. The principal character Gus is blown up by a gremlin over the English Channel by a Hawker Hurricane, but then convinces the gremlins as they parachuted into the water that they should unite against the common enemy, Hitler and the Nazis, rather than fight each other. By the end of the book, the gremlins have been retrained by the British Air Force to repair rather than sabotage aircraft and have restored Gus to full strength after his severe crash landing. This book also had an autobiographical allusion, as Roald Dahl himself had flown a Hawker Hurricane in the RAF and had been temporarily out of flying due to serious injuries he had suffered when he had crashed in Libya and was temporarily out of flying. He was back in the air. The book also gives us beautiful details about the daily life of the gremlins, for example, the name of the babies is Widgets and the females Fifinellas, the name of the great \"flying\" mare Fifinella, which had won both the Epsom Derby and Oaks in 1916, the year in which Roald Dahl was born.",

    "Shaara, following his father's method of concentrating on the principal officers of the two armies, General Robert E. Lee, Major-General Winfield Scott Hancock, Lieutenant-General Thomas J. 'Stonewall' Jackson, and Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, gave to his readers the fervid emotions of old friends engaged in warfare, while he conscientiously observed all the details of troop movements, strategical maneuvers, and battle situations. General Hancock, for example, was plagued throughout the novel by the thought that he might have to fire on his old friend and fellow abolitionist, General Armistead. The book also told of General Lee's disgust with the administration of the Confederacy, and of General Jackson's religious zeal. It dealt with the events that led up to the war and told of the battles of the first Bull Run, of Antietam, of Fredericksburg, and of Chancellorsville. In the film, which concentrated on the events leading up to the war and especially on General Lee and the secession of Virginia, the story of the pre-war events was very brief and the film did not show the battle of Antietam.",

The story of the novel is in two parts: one during his imprisonment in the asylum, which gradually becomes a memory; the other takes place after his release when he is obliged to write a book about the events of the murder.

In Tomb of Horrors, the players have to fight through a variety of tricks and traps, in order to penetrate the tomb of a dead wizard. The opening line of the adventure states: “The evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb as an undead creature.

In order to destroy the demilich, the adventurers must penetrate the deadly traps in the tomb, and penetrate the elaborately hidden secret chamber of Acererak the demilich, and lay his curse forever.” The adventure includes many deadly traps, like the “huge pit filled with 200 spikes” in encounter 20, or the “gold and silver mists” of encounter 22: “The mists are silvery, laced with delicate golden threads. The party can see only 6 feet in front of them. They sense a faint aura of good.

    "Close to the Wild Heart does not have a conventional narrative; it is made up of flashes from the life of Joana, between the present, as a young woman, and her childhood; and, like most of Lispector's works, it relates emotional, inner states. It opens with a scene of the child Joana, who plays in the garden, making poems to give to her father. Joana's violence, almost wildness, along with her linguistic creativity, is her main characteristic. Animals are constantly compared to her: during the book she is likened to a bird, a snake, a wildcat, a horse, and a dog. She commits transgressions: as a child, she throws a book at an old man's head, and as a married woman she leaves her husband, Otavio, after learning that he has committed adultery, he has made Ldia, an old friend of his, pregnant. She is not so much immoral as amoral: \"Immoral is not living, and that's it; dying is already something else. Between good and evil, living is something else. \" In this book she quotes long passages from Spinoza, the longest in her works; it seems that she felt an affinity with the amoral worldview of the Dutch philosopher.",
    "The narrator, Kristien, is a white professor who has come back to South Africa after her grandmother, a former judge, has been attacked by black young people and is now tied to her bed. The grandmother wants to tell the granddaughter the story of their Afrikaner family before she dies, a task that the grandmother and the granddaughter feel is very important. Memories of Kristien's past in London indicate that until then she has lived without any goals and without any interest in the things that happen to her, she has merely fulfilled the urge to escape South Africa and her parents (who defended apartheid). Exiting the self-imposed exile at first seems like a defeat for Kristien, but gradually she realizes that the country where she was born is changing. The first democratic elections are about to take place, and in the encounters with black and white people, and in the stories that her grandmother tells about the origins of their family – stories that relate almost exclusively to the female side of events and that go back to a black ancestor – Kristien begins to see South Africa as her home country. The night before the elections, her sister kills her children, her obnoxious, racist husband, and herself, to escape the unbearable life she is leading. The same night her grandmother dies of the injuries she received. Kristien is still optimistic about her future in South Africa. The farm goes to the family of the maid.",

He has been sent to Chiapas, Mexico, to report on the massacre of the indigenous population there by landlords working for capitalist corporations. But NewsReal, because of a deal struck with the Mexican government, does not transmit the programme, and he decides to retire from his job. He meets Margaret Mayfield, a rebel Zapatista, and they fall in love and decide to fight the capitalist elite. St. John and Mayfield decide to join an expedition sent by the corporations ‘Intrepid Explorers’, to find a strong band of Zapatistas to join. There they meet an individual who claims to be Subcomandante Marcos, the first revolutionary to take part in cyber-revolutions, and who proposes to St. John and Mayfield that they should place all the victims of the massacres killed by the capitalists with virtual interfaces so that the whole world can share in their suffering by assuming all the senses of the person so affected. As for Margaret Mayfield, she goes on her mission with Webster Webfoot, a former star of the Internet, but who, after his fall, has tried to avoid using his virtual interface whenever he can. She learns from NewsReal that Santee is dead and that the funeral is to take place tomorrow, and that Santee is not dead but has been killed. She leaves Webster some money for travel and goes off with Zack Hayman, a hotel-keeper who appears to have inside knowledge of the conspirators. Webster’s virtual girlfriend, Starchilde, or ‘Starr’ for short, learns from her work on a space station that there is oil on Mars and that this means that there was at one time biological life on Mars and that the rebels from Chiapas are being shipped to Mars to mine it. Back on earth, Zack, the hotel-keeper, discovers that the rebels are being sent to Mars partly so that the rich can take the land they occupied without resistance. Santee and Margaret believed they were installing virtual interfaces on the victims so that they could be made to suffer in solidarity with the victims outside Mexico. But in fact the virtual operatives were deceiving the rebels into thinking that they were receiving messages from Santee while they were in fact being deceived into going to Mars as slaves. On the ship going to Mars Starr learns that the rebels are going there to live for a while and to scout the place for any chemical or biological hazards. Starr then shows the rebels the whole of the Internet and she herself becomes convinced of the tyranny of the capitalists. Then Starr gives the rebels the virtual means to take over the ship and the Zapatistas, with the help of Alice Irene, take control of it and offer the revolutionaries the choice between staying on earth or going to Mars, but as an enlightened society and not as slaves. Santee St John and Margaret Mayfield opt for staying on earth, but the other main characters choose to go to Mars.",

    "The film The Aviator by Martin Scorsese is going to win the Academy, according to the opinion of the leading film critics of Britain. Several of them think, however, that the best director will be Clint Eastwood, and most critics predict that the actors Ray and Million dollar Baby will be the best. The jury consists of experts and critics from the leading British film magazines, and the panelists also revealed which of the nominated films they personally wish to win. They all expect The Aviator to win in the best film category, but many think that it will be a close competition between Scorsese's film about the life of the aviator and the film by Clint Eastwood, a boxer. The other nominated films are the wine comedy Sideways, the factual drama Finding Neverland and the biopic of Ray Charles. \"The Aviator will probably win, but my personal choice is Sideways,\" said the Observer critic Philip French. \"Sideways should win, but it's out of the question,\" said Total Film's Jamie Graham, an opinion shared by Film 2005 host Jonathan Ross. \"The pattern for the Oscars is The Aviator, but I liked Million dollar Baby better,\" said Tim Dams, the news editor of the film magazine Screen International. Five out of eight of the critics named Scorsese as the best director, while three, Mr. Dams, Charles Gant of Heat magazine and Empire's Angie Errigo, voted for Eastwood. Alexander Payne for Sideways, Taylor Hackford for Ray and Mike Leigh for the period drama Vera Drake were considered to be outsiders in this category. \"I thought for sure Scorsese would get it just because he's Scorsese,\" Errigo told the BBC news site. \"But I think Eastwood has a chance. \" The actor who portrays Ray Charles, Ronny Foxx, has already won at the Golden Globes, BAFTA and the Screen Actors Guild awards. Mr. Dams thinks this makes him the definite favorite to be named the best actor at the Academy. \"It would be a major surprise if he didn't win,\" he said. He's \"bettor's insurance.\" \"If Paul Giamatti had been nominated for Sideways, it would have been a different ball game,\" said Jamie Graham of Total Film. But Foxx will and should win. \" in the best actress category, he was also nominated for Kate Winslet. The winner is probably the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, of which Jonathan Ross is very fond, but The Times critic Charles Gant, however, sees the BAFTA award as \"unimportant\". It would be nice to see Imelda Staunton win, but her chances are not so great, he said, expecting to see another Oscar for Hilary Swank. \"I think Swank will win,\" said Philip French. \"Imelda has got as far as she can go with this role.\" He also likes Imelda Staunton, but he also predicts Swank. \"Everything can turn on a single vote and go the other way,\" he told the BBC news site. The British believe that the vote is not influenced by the reputation of a director or a film. \" The Americans are quite a different story, they have to look at the script and see how they have to work to get the job done. The readers of BBC radio 5's site have also been asked which movie they would like to have won an Oscar without having won one. The radio audience voted in favor of the Shawshank Redemption, the 1994 film by Frank Darabont, which received 51 percent of the votes from the web and 68 percent of the votes by text message. The next two films, Citizen Kane and A Matter of Life and Death, were voted for almost equally. The British will be able to see the awards on Sky 1 at 01:00 on Monday morning.

    "The authorities of Coahuila, in the state of Coahuila, have announced that they will confiscate lands owned by a British company, part of the Vestey Group, in the framework of the agrarian reform undertaken by the government of Hugo Chávez. This follows the establishment, by the president of the Republic, of a special commission to supervise the operation of the so-called “latifundios” (large properties), which according to the government are only left idle. The Vestey Group has declared that it has not been notified of the intended confiscation. The company, whose subsidiary Agroflora has thirteen farms in the country, has affirmed that it has complied with the Venezuelan laws. The judicial authorities in the south of the country, where Agroflora owns a ranch, have set their sights on El Charco, a cattle ranch. According to Reuters, they intend to confiscate an area of 5,200 acres out of the 32,000 that the ranch covers. The authorities affirm that Agroflora does not have valid title to the land in question. They also allege that certain parcels of the ranch are not being used for any agricultural activity. The State Attorney Alexis Ortiz declared to Reuters that there was a difference between the legal boundaries of the property and the boundaries as laid down by custom. “The result is that the government is putting it out of use.” According to the controversial reforms of 2001, the government has the right to take over private property that is declared idle or where the ownership cannot be traced back to the nineteenth century. The law has been criticized as infringing private property rights. The Vestey Group has affirmed that it has owned the property since 1920 and that it is working in full compliance with the authorities. But it added that it was “very confident” that the documents it has produced will demonstrate that it has valid title to the property. The company affirmed that the ranch, which employs 300 workers, produces meat solely for the domestic market. In a recent report, the government declared that it had found more than 500 “latifundios” that were not producing any income, and that it was still considering 40,000 more. It also stated that any owner who had a valid title to their property and whose property was in production had nothing to fear. It has also affirmed that it will take into consideration the land for use as a reserve for a new generation. Under President Chavez, the government has steadily expanded its role in the economy. Recently, it has said that it would examine all mining contracts in order to determine whether they are bringing sufficient benefits to the state.",
    "Daniela Hantuchová moved into the quarter-finals of the Dubai Open by defeating Elena Likhotsev 7-5, 6-4 and will now face Serena Williams. The Australian Open champion came through a setback in the first game to beat Elena Bovina 1-6, 6-1, 6-4. Davenport beat China's Jie Zheng 6-2, 7-5, while Myskina, the French Open champion, retired due to an injury to her opponent, Marion Bartoli.

Davenport sees a lot of room for improvement before her encounter with Martnez: \"I started well and I finished well, but I played a bit in the middle,\" she said. Serena Williams was also not satisfied. \"I don't know what I did there,\" she said. All my shots went away.

The 34-year-old American, eighth in the rankings, started badly, losing the first set and missing two chances to win the next set. Then he was able to take the lead, but his service lapsed again and the two players exchanged breaks. But Agassi came back, won the tiebreaker, and then finished it off in three straight sets, 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 (11), 6-1. Fourth-ranked Ivan Lendl escaped an injury scare when he beat the Croat Mario Ancic 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. In the third game of the fourth set, Ancic twisted his right ankle and immediately asked for medical attention. But he was able to return to the court and finished off the victory in two hours and forty-five minutes. Ancic, a Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2004, looked to be a tough challenge for the top-ranked Safin, winning the second set, but Safin came up with a new game plan and knocked off the Croat. Safin said he had been trying to control his temper in this tournament. Safin slapped himself on the head a few times during a second-set outburst, but he stayed pretty cool in the rest of the match. “I’m trying to keep my cool because if you lose your cool against a player like Ancic, it’s difficult to come back. The Russian said he wasn’t worried about the ankle injury. “I’ve had a lot of trouble with that ankle in the past, so I think I’ll be fine.” The Russian’s path to the fourth round was eased when Jarkko Nieminen retired because of injury. The defending champion was leading 6-3, 5-2 when the Finn, who had won the first set, retired. In this match the world number one had been somewhat inconsistent, hitting 19 unforced errors to 19 winners. He will next face the Cypriot Marin Cilic, who defeated Tommy Robredo 7-6 (13), 6-4, 6-1. (Ancic is ranked 94th.) Sixth-ranked Roger Federer, whose winning streak reached an amazing 24, said he felt some added pressure after he had won twenty-four consecutive matches. “I felt this would be a tough match. I had a poor start, but I came back. I always want to play better, but I think I did pretty well.” However, the sixth-ranked Swiss, who lost to Dominik Hrbaty 7-6 (13), 6-7 (11), 6-7 (5), 6-7 (3), 6-1, 6-3, was out of the tournament after four hours and twenty-one minutes. After exchanging sixteen breaks, Hrbaty moved ahead 3-2 in the eighth game of the final set. He will face the Czech Radek Stepanek, who beat American Kevin Kim 3-6, 6-2, 6-7 (11), 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.",
    "UK aid to the Asian disaster victims will not divert resources from Africa, Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised. Speaking on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost program, he said that the money for the Asian disaster would not \"clash\" with the money the United Kingdom wanted to spend on Africa. When asked if he had not lost faith in God in the disaster, he said: I haven't lost my faith in anything. He added that he would give new figures to the House of Commons on Monday about British casualties in the disaster. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Friday that about 440 Britons had been killed or were missing, and he said that the figures had not changed much since then, and that this must be a sign that the figures are starting to drop. But we can't be sure. It's a hugely difficult task to get accurate figures. Every country is struggling with it. The original £50 million set aside by the Department for International Development is now largely allocated. But until the World Bank has finished its evaluation, the precise amount of aid cannot be determined, he said. In the next few weeks, it will be clearer what the reconstruction costs will be. But Africa, where every month a \"tsunami of preventable deaths\" is reported in poverty, conflict and disease, will not be forgotten. As Britain prepares to take over the G8 presidency, the African agenda has taken on a greater significance, he said. Now for the first time, a plan has been devised that not only covers debt and development, but also the governance of African countries and conflict resolution. A lot of the problems in Africa are due to conflict, and these too are preventable if the right conditions are in place.",
    "Despite the recent slump in the housing market, the mortgage and house building industries remain buoyant, according to bankers, and to George Wimpey, the housebuilder. The mortgage bank, Bradford & Bingley, which specializes in letting, expects the business to continue to expand at a much faster rate than the mortgage market in general. Profits rose by 6 percent, to £28m. Wimpey's profits rose by 19 per cent, to £457m, and orders for new houses were more plentiful than anticipated. Recent reports on the state of the housing market show that the recent years of phenomenal growth are over, and the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages, which played such a large part in the recent boom, is falling. However, Bingley, which has a 22 per cent share of the UK letting market, says that though the rate of growth is falling, it is still \"significantly higher than the overall mortgage market\". In its overall assessment of the market, the bank says that \"housing market fundamentals remain strong\". Interest rates and unemployment are likely to stay at their current low level, and real household incomes will rise; “over the medium term, demand for new homes is likely to continue to outstrip supply.” However, despite the upbeat comments, Bingley shares were down by 4 per cent at 325p in the morning, as investors fretted over future growth. Wimpey's profits exceeded expectations, with a strong performance in the US offsetting a slowdown in the UK. Wimpey said that the UK market was “challenging” in the last year. The market slowed down towards the end of the summer, and did not recover during the autumn. However, the first seven weeks of the year have been encouraging, and inquiries and reservations have been “above the top end of our expectations.” Wimpey shares were up 6 per cent, in the morning, at 458.5p.",
    "The government’s concessions on a bill criticised for allegedly opening the door to euthanasia “by the back door” were not a “ploy”, the Lord Chancellor has claimed. In the Commons on Tuesday ministers were accused of panicking and offering last-minute concessions on the Mental Capacity Bill. He said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue, but some MPs have said they still don’t know. The bill would allow people to give another person power of attorney to make decisions for them if they become too ill to do so for themselves. Ministers have insisted this would not change the law on euthanasia and that the new safeguards would protect people. However, critics have said it could allow people to be killed by having their treatment stopped, including food and water. Tony Blair said he would do everything to meet concerns about the bill. But changes to the bill must not undermine the ruling that a court can order doctors to stop feeding and hydration from a man in a coma. He said he did not want to end up with a situation where doctors or hospital consultants were confused about the law, and where they might face criminal proceedings when no reasonable person would want that to happen. On Tuesday the government saw off a backbench rebellion against the bill by 297 votes to 203. But the revolt was quelled partly because of news that the Catholic Archbishop of Cardiff had secured a promise from the Lord Chancellor to strengthen the safeguards. Then, as the vote loomed, MPs bombarded the minister for constitutional affairs, David Lammy, with demands that he read out the letter, saying they had not been told of the changes. It took five minutes before the crucial vote to do so, provoking accusations of a shambles. The deputy speaker later said the issue had not been handled well. Lord Falconer said there would be further changes when the bill goes to the House of Lords. He told the BBC: “We have committed ourselves to put into the bill a provision that says nothing in the bill authorises any decision where the motive of the person giving that decision is to end life, but merely to end suffering.” He denied the changes were a “political manoeuvre” prompted by the rebellion. The debate was “hardening” as the bill went through Parliament, but the outcome was a “sensible solution”. “These issues are not easy to resolve,” he said. The BBC’s political editor, Andrew Marr, said Mr Lammy was “up to his neck in quicksand” after his performance. But Lord Falconer said his minister had done “an excellent job”. But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who is one of the most prominent opponents of the bill, said it was a “charade” and that the safeguards promised were “vague”.",
    "In January manufacturing grew at its slowest pace for one and a half years, according to a survey. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said its purchasing managers' index fell to 51.80 from a revised 53.50 in December. However, although it fell below the expected 53.7, the number remained above 50, which means the sector is still expanding. The institute said the strong pound had harmed exports, and the rising cost of oil and metals weighed on business. Rising costs and slowing demand meant factory managers were reluctant to recruit, which meant that the employment index fell to 48.3 for the second month in a row, its lowest level since June 2003. The survey is more upbeat than official figures, which show manufacturing is in contraction. However, economists said the data suggested the manufacturing recovery was losing momentum. “The UK is in a two-speed economy again,” said economist Lena Komileva at Prebon Yamane. “There is weakness in manufacturing, which would be a worry for the Bank of England.”",
    "An American stewardess who was suspended for \"inappropriate\" pictures on her weblog says she's been fired. The stewardess, Ellen Simonetti, who called herself the Queen of the Skies, kept a semi-fictitious account of her life in the air. She was suspended from her job with the company in September. In a statement, she announced that she would sue the company for \"unfair termination.\" On Wednesday, a spokesman for Delta confirmed that the stewardess was no longer an employee. The company has repeatedly refused to comment on what it has called \"internal personnel matters.\" The spokesman said that there were \"very clear rules\" about unauthorized use of Delta's trademarks and uniforms. On her weblog, Simonetti said she was fired on November 1. On the company's behalf, she wrote, \"As a result of my suspension and subsequent termination for no reason, I have filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\" She also said she had hired a Texas law firm to sue for a \"violation of my civil rights, defamation, and lost wages.\" In a telephone interview with the BBC News Web site, Simonetti said she had been suspended without any explanation or warning. The Queen of the Skies has received support and advice from the worldwide weblog community since news of her suspension first appeared on the BBC News Web site and other news services. The story has highlighted a growing concern among the weblog community about possible conflicts of interest, conflicts of interest, employment laws, and free speech on personal websites. Simonetti began her weblog in January as a way of dealing with the death of her mother. The Queen of the Skies, as a fictional character, developed over the months. In her posts, she gave fictitious names to cities and companies to protect her identity, but she also included images of herself in her uniform. Of ten images, only one showed her Delta \"wings.\" Simonetti said she never intended to harm the company and did not understand how she could harm it. Legal experts in the US said they thought that Delta was afraid that the posts, although not specifically about the company, would be associated with it, because of the images. Delta is currently under great pressure from rising fuel costs and the high level of competition. It has announced plans to cut between 6,500 and 7,000 jobs and reduce costs by $ 3.1 billion. Analysts have recently warned that the company might be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This week, the pilots voted for a $ 1 billion cost-cutting plan that would probably prevent the bankruptcy of the company. The pilots were to accept a pay cut of 32 percent and were given the right to buy 30 million shares of the company, the union said. Also on Monday, Delta said it had reached an agreement to delay about $ 134 million in debt until 2007. The company said it also agreed to a loan of up to $ 600 million from American Express.",

    "A thousand slaves were accepted as security for loans by two banks which became a part of J. P. Morgan and Company. The admission is contained in a memorandum addressed to the staff of the company, and is made under the pretext that the company was making inquiries into its connections with slavery in order to comply with a law passed in Chicago. The two lending banks were the Canal Bank and the Citizens’ Bank. They are now closed, but they formed a part of the Bank One which J. P. Morgan bought last year. Between 1831 and 1865, a total of 13,500 slaves were pledged as security for loans. As a result of defaults, the two banks acquired 1,250 slaves themselves. We know that slavery existed in the United States, but it is quite different to see how our history and the institution of slavery were entangled together,” the letter signed by William Chase, the president of J. P. Morgan and James B. Dimon, the chief executive, begins. Slavery was unfortunately a part of American life, but this is no excuse. We apologize to the African American community, especially to the descendants of slaves, and to the rest of the American public for the part which the Canal Bank and the Citizens’ Bank played in the epochs of the slave trade. The times of slavery are a tragic epoch in the history of the United States and in the history of our company. The letter announces that J. P. Morgan will establish a scholarship fund of $ 5 million for students in Louisiana, where the events took place. The company declares that it is a different company today than the Canal Bank and the Citizens’ Bank in the nineteenth century.",
    "The plot of an international best seller that thousands of people will probably be given as a Christmas gift, is a laughing matter, a priest says. The Da Vinci Code, which says that Jesus Christ was not crucified, but had married Mary Magdalene and had died of a natural death, says the Church later covered up this fact. The book has been sold around the world over seven million times. The Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Dr Tom Wright, said the book was a great thriller, but a bad history. Dan Brown's conspiracy theory may have been a treat for the reader, but he was disappointed in the lack of evidence to back it up. In his Christmas message, published in the Northern Echo, he said: “Conspiracy theories are always fun – fun to think up, fun to read and fun to ponder. But anyone who knows anything about the history of the first century will find the underlying substance of this work a laughable matter.” A large amount of credible evidence proves that the biblical story of Jesus is true, the bishop said. The evidence for Jesus and the origins of Christianity is very good, he said. There are a hundred times more early copies of the New Testament books than for the main classical writers, such as Cicero, Virgil and Tacitus. Historical research shows that they build a consistent and credible picture of Jesus, with all sorts of details that fit the time he lived in, and which do not fit into the world of later legends. The Da Vinci Code has become a publishing phenomenon, topping the UK and US best-seller lists for the past two years. It has been translated into 42 languages, and has spawned a whole industry of guides to reading the book, debunking and refuting it. It has been made into a film with Tom Hanks in the leading role.",

    "Employment conditions will be raised from the end of this year; from now on, employers will not be able to force workers to retire before they reach the age of sixty-five, without giving reasons. The government has now announced that from the beginning of the coming year, companies will no longer be allowed to impose arbitrary retirement ages. New European age discrimination regulations are introduced, and a compulsory retirement age of sixty-five will be established. Workers will be able to ask for an extension of this retirement age, but the company has the right to refuse. Trade and industry minister Patricia Hewitt says that people will not be forced to work longer than they want to, as the regulation age is not a statutory retirement age. She says that as long as the worker is capable of doing his job, the employer is free to keep him. Under the age discrimination proposals from the Ministry of Trade and Industry last year, workers were allowed to continue to work until the age of seventy, if they wished, and companies opposed this proposal because it would have been too expensive and complicated. Now, however, the British Chamber of Commerce is welcome the new proposal. \"This move is a move in the right direction,\" it says. \"It gives companies the right to decide when an employment relationship ends, while giving workers the flexibility to ask to stay on after the age of sixty-five.\" But Age Concern says imposing a retirement age of sixty-five is \"cowardly\" and \"totally reversed\". \"It completely belies the government's alleged commitment to abolishing ageism and will now seriously undermine the incoming age-discrimination law,\" says director-general of Age Concern England, Mr. Lishman. \"It is certain that older people will challenge this decision under European law.\" The government says the decision will not affect the age at which people receive their pensions.",
    "Music distribution sites have proven popular not only among young people, who have come to expect free music, but also among savvy advertisers, who are looking for a captive audience. The debate about the legality of music distribution sites continues to rage, as the music industry continues to threaten to close them down forever. In the meantime, the millions of consumers are both a dream come true for the advertiser and a nightmare for the brand. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a peer-to-peer music distribution service, believes that it’s time for brands to stop breathing the same oxygen as sites that facilitate piracy. “You may be surprised to know that, as of today, the most popular music distribution site, eDonkey, is still advertising a number of large companies that support the theft of copyrighted music with real cash: the Nat West, the BT Group, O2, NTL and even Renault,” he wrote in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry, urging people to follow his lead and stop using any brand that is associated with eDonkey. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) also has a bone to pick with established brands that choose to associate themselves with sites that facilitate piracy. “These networks such as eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate the illegal sharing of music and the BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should carefully consider the support they give to these sites through their advertising budgets,” the BPI said in a statement. “Millions of pounds are stolen every year from the music industry by those who pirate it and we are sure that those companies advertising on these services would not tolerate such theft in their own businesses,” the BPI added. But the situation for brands is far more complicated, says Mark Mulligan, an analyst with Jupiter Research. “This has been an issue since the early days of Napster,” he told BBC News. “In reality, millions of people who are constantly connected to the sites are very attractive for the advertiser. “It’s probably cheaper to advertise there than on other, more respectable sites, and the audience is perfect,” he added. “If you can put the legal issues aside, it’s a pretty attractive opportunity to reach a large audience.” Some of the companies contacted by the BBC News website deny that they have any knowledge of the sites on which their adverts are appearing. Onetel, which is advertising on eDonkey, has the following to say. “We have investigated this matter and we believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. We do not have a policy of advertising on peer-to-peer networks and we have asked them to remove it immediately,” a spokeswoman for the company told BBC News. A spokesman for NTL, which is also advertising on eDonkey, blames its advertising agency for a lack of knowledge of the sites on which its adverts appear. “We have given our agency strict instructions that our adverts should not appear on these types of sites,” he said. But Mark Mulligan isn’t convinced. This might be excusable for less well-known companies, but not for well-known brands. “I would be surprised if they were unable to prevent this from happening,” he added. At the moment eDonkey is benefiting from some very well-known names advertising on its network. Sam Yagan, its chief executive, says that some of the world’s biggest brands are using eDonkey. “Senator John Kerry and President George W Bush have used eDonkey as a platform to reach the world’s largest audience.” “Peer-to-peer clients offer the world’s biggest brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers in the most comfortable place for them: on their desktops while they’re consuming their favorite digital media,” he added.",
    "Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou were to learn on Wednesday whether they were to be banned for missing drug-testing during the London Olympic Games. The IAAF Council held a telephonic conference on Tuesday to make its decision. The two olympians pulled out of the Olympic team after they failed to show up for the test, claiming to have been injured in a motorbike accident. In Greece, the two athletes and their former coach Christos Tzekos are facing charges for deliberately missing the tests and for staging an accident. They are awaiting the date of their trial. The IAAF, after examining all the evidence, will rule on the athletes’ future in athletics. The Greek Athletics Association will be notified of any disciplinary action, and the two sprinters can appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Both athletes had sent written statements to the IAAF, which had taken these into account. The IAAF had earlier issued a formal warning to the sprinters and their coach Tzekos after they were found to be training in Qatar, not Crete, as they had reported. Despite this, they both then failed to appear for tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, and also failed to show up in Athens after flying home early. The pair resigned just before the Olympic Tests were to begin. In the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, Kenteris won gold in the 200 metres, and Thanou silver.",
    "Jason Gardener battled hard to win the men’s 60 metres title at the Norwich Union British Trials and AAA Championships at Ipswich. The world 60m champion, in his element at a standing start, just got the better of his rivals, Mark Findlay and Darren Chin, who both set personal bests. “It was a close race,” admitted Gardener. “I stumbled at the start but I think my experience just told. I still feel there’s more to come and I believe I can run faster.” Gardener’s performance in the Sheffield semi-finals might have been influenced by the news that his European record had been beaten by the Frenchman, Ronan Pognon, who is a threat to Gardener’s European title in the short term. Victory went to the favourite, Anita Whelahan, who ran an outstanding race to win the women’s 60 metres in 7.27 seconds. “You will see me in Madrid and I feel I have more to give,” said the 22-year-old. Joice Maduaka had withdrawn from the final because of a chest infection. The former champion, Gail Emms, again broke the British record in the women’s 60 metres hurdles. The 25-year-old, who had set the record twice in seven days, clocked 7.96 seconds to beat Diane Allgrove, who ran a personal best of 8.15 seconds. Emms was in tears as she told BBC Sport: “I’m so pleased, all these years of running and now people are starting to notice me.” Her time also qualified her for the European Championships. In the men’s 800 metres in Sheffield the defending champion, Mark McIlroy, went off in the lead and never looked back to win in 1 minute 47.96 seconds. He had qualified for the European Championships along with the Welshman, James Watkins, who clocked a personal best of 1 minute 48.32 seconds. In the women’s event the European standard was not met, as she came home in 2 minutes 4.45 seconds. The Olympic bronze medallist rounded off a good weekend by running two more personal bests in Sheffield. The 28-year-old cleared 1.80 metres in the high jump and ran in the heats of the 60 metres hurdles in 8.47 seconds. “I am surprised by my performance and I think I’m beginning to enjoy the pressure, but it’s not the end of the world if I don’t do well in Madrid.” The Manchester pole vaulter, Tom Solesbury, marked his return to the sport with victory after serving a two-year ban for using anabolic steroids. In the men’s triple jump he also set a new standard in the event. He jumped 17.30 metres on his last jump—the longest jump so far this year. “I really had no idea,” he said. “I’ve never jumped indoors before and I just wanted to make sure I made the qualifying mark.” he added. “But this isn’t a bad start and hopefully I can come back from Madrid with a gold medal.” In the long jump the two European long jump champions, Thomas Barr and Anita Wijnants, resumed their rivalry, with Barr achieving the qualifying mark and Wijnants jumping a lifetime best of 7.55 metres. The British champion, Eamon Morgan, had a first jump of 7.96 metres, the longest jump by any woman in the field, but he retired after the first jump with a sore heel. Olympic medallist Chris Tomlinson, also injured his heel and pulled out after the first jump. “I’ve been told by my doctor not to jump and I’m glad to have got through today.” The Loughborough-trained Kelly Sothcott, now in the women’s 400 metres, overtook the leader Catherine Murphy in the final hundred metres to win her first British indoor title. The 21-year-old clocked a personal best of 53.45 seconds, beating Catherine Murphy, who has already achieved the qualifying time. The 18-year-old Sudanese, Rabah Yusuf, who is applying for British citizenship, was third. In the women’s high jump, Libby Wells, with a best of 1.90 metres, achieved the qualifying mark and won the title. In the men’s 3,000 metres, the reigning champion, Steve Ovett, produced a personal best of seven minutes 56.86 seconds to retain his title and beat the qualifying mark for the European indoors. It was the first time at the British Championships for over ten years that the eight-minute barrier had been broken. In the absence of Kelly Holmes, Sarah Law won the women’s 1,500 metres title. The time, four minutes 19.11 seconds, was outside the qualifying mark, but Nicola Ovens had already pulled out of the race. The men’s race was won by Tony Stirland, who held off a strong finish from the chasing pack to win the title in three minutes 45.87 seconds.",
    "With the intention of improving the way it handles weblogs and blogs, Ask Jeeves has bought the site Bloglines, which has become enormously popular by giving readers a central place to read, search, and discuss all their favorite weblogs. Ask Jeeves says it has no intention of changing the design of Bloglines but will use the three hundred million archived pages to improve its own Web index. How much Ask Jeeves paid for the service was not disclosed. The service has become popular because it makes it easy to follow the latest news from all the sites a reader wants to read without having to visit each of the sites. To do this, it uses the technology of Really Simple Syndication, which many weblogs have adopted so that other sites know when a new entry has been made. This move follows similar ones by other search engines. Google bought Pyra Labs, which had developed the popular service of Blogger, in 2003. In 2004, MSN introduced its own weblog reader, and last year, Yahoo! said it was making improvements in the way it deals with weblogs. The vice-president of Ask Jeeves in the United States, Jim Lanzone, said the company had not bought Bloglines just to gain a foothold in the weblog publishing industry. Rather, he said, Ask Jeeves was interested in presenting searchers with information rather than helping them publish. “The universe of readers is far greater than the universe of writers,” he said. The service would be an excellent complement to the Jeeves personalization service, which lets users build their own web pages. “Search engines are about discovering new content, and RSS is an ideal way to keep track of new sites,” he said. There were no immediate plans to make major changes to the service. “We will take the time we need to figure out the right business model, rather than trying to monetize it right away,” he said. He did say, however, that Ask Jeeves’s own technology of indexing would be used to organize the three hundred million entries in the service’s archive. Having a way of searching the entire weblog world is in itself very useful, he said. The news of the acquisition was broken by the weblog Napsterization, which said it had been tipped off by people inside Ask Jeeves.",
    "Muslims in this country must expect that people who look Islamic are more likely to be stopped and searched by the police, a minister has said. Hazel Blears said innocent Muslims were being singled out in the hunt for Islamic extremists, and that she was also looking at whether the entry qualifications for Islamic leaders should be made more stringent. The comments have been condemned as “outrageous and irresponsible” by the Islamic Human Rights Commission. The Conservative MP for Salford told the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee that the threat was most likely to come from people associated with an extreme form of Islam, or from those who falsely claim to be Muslim. “If there is a threat from a particular place, then our action is going to be focused on that area,” she said. And she said that she would ask religious groups to consider whether their faith leaders needed to have additional skills such as a knowledge of British citizenship and the ability to work with the wider community. Ministers last year introduced a requirement for all faith leaders to have a high level of English. IHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh said the minister was playing the “Islamophobia card” in the run-up to the election. “She is demonising and isolating our community,” he said. “It is an invitation for a backlash, and for the bigots to unleash a savage attack on the Muslim community. This is the kind of comment that plays into the hands of the bigots.” Later, the prime minister’s spokesman urged people to see Ms Blears’s comments in context. “She understands there is a perception that stop and search is directed against a particular community,” he said. “But it is not directed against any particular community, and it is not police policy to direct such measures against any particular community.” facts. Of the 17 people convicted of terrorism in the UK since the September 11 attacks, only four – or a third – whose ethnic origin was known were Muslim. Meanwhile, it has been reported that ethnic minorities are increasingly being targeted by police in stop-and-search operations. During 2003/2004, Asians accounted for 12.5% of all stops, although they make up just 4.7% of the population. In July last year, Muslim groups accused the police of “extreme Islamophobia” after a study found that the number of Asians stopped under anti-terrorism laws had risen by 300% since the measures were introduced.",
    "Greek sprinter Kostas Kenteris' lawyer is demanding that the anti-doping charges against the former Olympic champion be withdrawn. He is claiming that his former Olympian client has not cheated. Last December he and fellow countrywoman Katerina Thanou were convicted of failing to report for the pre-Olympics test in London. The Greek Olympic Committee is due to announce its decision next week. Both had been forced to withdraw from the Olympic event in Athens last year after failing to report for the drug test on the eve of the opening ceremony. Before that they had been accused of failing to appear at the drug test in Tel Aviv and Chicago. But the lawyer, Yiannis Ioannidis, claims that the Olympic Committee's decision should be made to withdraw the charges. He added that he has provided evidence which will make it appear that the officials knew that Kenteris was in Germany on the day that he was accused of missing the Chicago test. In the meantime, Nick Davies, spokesman for the International Association of Athletics, which had initially imposed the two-year ban, said that he was unable to comment, as the hearings had been conducted behind closed doors. However, he did say that the Greek athletics federation would make its decision by the end of February, and that a statement would be made at that time. Kenteris won the 200m gold medal at the Sydney Olympic event in 2000.",
    "The jockey John McCririck was the latest celebrity to leave the house in Celebrity Big Brother. He had been nominated to leave the Channel 4 show along with dancer from the Happy Mondays, Bez. Bez was once one of the most popular housemates, but has recently become surly and argumentative. Bez and McCririck were asked to leave on Monday evening after the first eviction of the series – the actor Sylvester Stallone’s mother, Jackie, and former model Brigitte Nielsen. Bez was furious at the news that five of his fellow housemates had nominated him to go, while John had only four votes against him. Afterwards, McCririck said: “Bez is a difficult man. There’s something wrong with him. Even though he’s trying, he’s not very happy here.” Former Holby City actor Jeremy Edwards had put Bez up for eviction after he became agitated on Friday evening and talked about climbing over the fence to go clubbing. He said Bez was being “strange” and “stressed”. According to the bookmakers, John McCririck was the favourite to leave on Monday evening, while Bez was third in the betting. McCririck was in the public vote last week and had 67 per cent in favour of staying in the house, while Sylvester Stallone’s mother, Jackie, was evicted.",
    "How people get their digital entertainment in the future may change after the launch of an ambitious European project. In Nice last week, the European Commission announced the launch of the NEM initiative, which extends from the way digital content is produced through to the playback of such content. The Commission aims to give people the opportunity to find and play content in a unified way, whether they are on the move, at home or at work, and whether they come from a supplier of devices, networks, content or content protection. More than 120 experts gathered in Nice to discuss this vision of an interconnected future and to see if companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica would be willing to work together. It may be surprising that these seemingly competing companies are willing to work together. But time and again the participants stressed that incompatible and isolated solutions would not be viable. A long-term strategy was needed for the evolution and convergence of devices and services. The European Commission is taking a practical approach. They acknowledge that many groups have already defined the standards for digital content in the areas covered by NEM. NEM's approach is to carefully examine the standards that are already in place or in development, choose the best, pool them and then map out the gaps. Where gaps are found, NEM is looking at developing new standards to fill them. It is notable that such a large and powerful body has declared its wish for digital content to be accessible to everyone and playable on any device. This is likely to be welcomed, if not surprised, by many individuals and organizations who feel that the wishes of the content provider are usually put before those of the consumer. Many feel that the most difficult task for the Commission is to resolve the different digital rights management (DRM) schemes. The current solutions are incompatible, and so some kinds of content cannot be played on all devices. With the opportunity of taking a percentage of every media transaction, the prize for the supplier of the dominant DRM scheme is huge. In the first stage, it is a matter of digital entertainment, but later it will include the remote delivery of health care, the energy efficiency of a smart home and the control of the whole house. According to the Commission, the NEM project is a ten-year project that draws together the results of many ongoing research projects that the Commission has been funding for many years. Simon Perry, the editor of the digitallifestyles.net website, has described the key features of the planned NEM framework and described the efforts that have been made so far to find solutions to the various problems.",

    "TELLS the Mail that Liverpool will not sell Steven Gerrard, despite reports that Chelsea are about to make a second attempt to poach him from Anfield. After Wednesday’s goal, Gerrard insisted that he wanted to win trophies with Liverpool, and Parry echoed his words. “Stevie will not be going anywhere in January,” he said. “We are determined not to let him go.” Gerrard scored a brilliant late winner against Olympiakos to give Liverpool a 3-1 win and secure their place in the knockout rounds. “Of course, he is ambitious, but we are, too,” Parry added. “And we are convinced that if we can satisfy his ambition, he will stay with us.” “Stevie and I are on good terms and I believe that played a big part in his decision to stay last summer. But if he did not have the right attitude to Liverpool, he would have left long ago.” Gerrard had admitted before the Olympiakos game that he would think about leaving if Liverpool were knocked out of the Champions League, with Real Madrid also said to be interested in him. “I’ve said before I want to play for a Liverpool side that is constantly challenging for the Champions League and the title,” he said after the game. “I want to win trophies with Liverpool, not with another team.” “I am a fan, too, and I think what I have said is what the fans want to hear. We must build on victories like that, not just settle for good wins and not go any further.” “My goal was one of the most important I have ever scored, and I hope it will be one of the most important the club has scored for a long time.” “I knew my comments would put a lot of pressure on me, but I do not want to go around lying about how I feel.” But Reds manager Rafael Benitez said: “Steven can win everything he wants with us and we need him. He has seen we have a good side and we can win more in the future. But to win more of these big games, we need his strength, his mental strength and his quality. He wants the responsibility of leading the team.”",
    "Church ministers are trying to prevent rap star Nelly from a concert in Arkansas because they don't want to see his \"dirty and nasty lyrics\" in their city. More than 20 ministers in Jonesboro called on fans to refuse to attend Nelly's March 12 concert at the University of Arkansas. \"Jonesboro is a wonderful city because of what doesn't come here,\" said the Rev. Adrian Rodgers. But a spokesman for the event said more than 5,000 tickets had been sold. The Fullness of Joy Church leader said he was worried about Nelly's lyrics, which included drug use, sexual content and violence, and rap music, which the minister said degraded women. He and his fellow pastors said that bringing such rap music to Jonesboro could lead to trouble. \"Tear up your ticket and don't go, and don't allow your children to go,\" he said. But Tim Dean, director of the university's venue, said sales had been good. He said: \"It looks like many people have expressed their right to find Nelly's music entertaining and worthy of their time and money.\" Nelly has sold more than 30 million singles and albums worldwide and has had two number one albums in the US in September 2004. In the UK he has had 12 hit singles, including Hot in Herre, Dilemma and Over and Over, which recently topped the charts.",
    "Brian O'Driscoll will lead the northern hemisphere in the game that will be played in the IRB event in London on Sunday, November 6, when a large number of world class players will meet to donate money for the Japanese disaster appeal. The southern hemisphere will be led by George Gregan, one of four Wallabies, and he will be accompanied by five Springboks and four All Blacks, of whom captain Tana Umaga. Schalk Burger, the South African flanker, has shaken off a leg injury and has been included in the starting line-up, together with John Smit, Cobus Visie and Victor Matfield in the back, and Jacques Fourie in the center. The northern hemisphere has been affected by the withdrawal of the Scots Gordon Bulloch and Chris Cusiter, and the French captain Fabien Pelous. However, the Leicester center and England Olly Smith has been included in the squad, which means he has an opportunity to impress the Lions coach, Sir Clive Woodward, who will coach the northern hemisphere. \"It's great for Olly,\" Wells told BBC Radio Leicester, \"he probably would have had the weekend off, so I hope that Clive can see in him what we and England have seen in him all year.\" Woodward will also be able to see the Scot Simon Taylor and Chris Paterson, the Wales Dwayne Peel, and Ireland lock Paul O'Connell. Woodward says he is looking forward to working with such outstanding players. \"Both teams have assembled an excellent line-up and I hope that the entire rugby community supports the game so that it can raise as much money as possible for such a worthy cause. Despite the withdrawal of Wales wing Rhys Williams, who has to miss the game against Munster, three other members of the Blues squad, Ceri Sweeney, John Yapp and Jonathan Thomas, are included. \"Not only are these players playing for a good cause, but they have an opportunity to play against the best players in the world,\" said WRU general manager Steve Lewis.

    "An artist critical of the Welsh Assembly Government’s control of the arts in Wales has denied that he compared the idea to dictatorships in Russia and Germany. Shani Rhys James fears that the Arts Council of Wales may be taken over by the Assembly Government. But he said he had actually said that artists needed freedom. The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been uncertain since it was announced that most of the Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished. In July it was announced that three Welsh quangos, the educational and training agency, Elwa, the tourist board and the Welsh Development Agency would be brought under the control of the Assembly Government. The Arts Council of Wales may be next to go. But Shani Rhys James, winner of the £30,000 Jerwood Painting Prize in 2003, told BBC Wales that the arts should be kept separate from the government. “In a democratic society free expression is essential. There should be a separation, there should not be any interference, it can go badly wrong.” But he said reports that he compared the idea to the totalitarian regimes of Russia and Germany were not true. “The quotation I actually gave was ‘In a civilised society artists must be allowed to express themselves freely without government control.’ As we know from the history of Europe, from Russia and Germany in the early twentieth century, artists will go underground or leave the country rather than compromise their expression.” Artists need a free voice, they are the voice of truth.” He added that the Assembly Government was not the right organisation to run the arts in Wales. “It would be a huge change and would have a devastating effect on the arts.” It would set the arts back sixty years because the Assembly Government does not have the expertise. “If the Assembly Government take control it’ll be back to dragons and leeks and choirs. Wales has moved on.” It is now an international nation, not just a backdrop to How Green Was My Valley. In response to Shani Rhys James’s criticisms, the Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism, Huw Evans, said: “We have already indicated that the structure of un-elected quangos is under review and further announcements will be made very soon.” The Assembly Government was being compared to Nazi Germany, which is a scurrilous and ignorant comment on a serious issue of democratic accountability. Shani Rhys James was born in Melbourne, where her parents worked in the theatre. She came to Wales about 20 years ago and now lives and works near Llangadfan. She has been successful in many art competitions, including the Wales Open in 1989 and the Mostyn Open in 1991.",
    "D’Arcy, a second-row forward, has been ruled out of the Irish team for the Six Nations match at Murrayfield this Saturday. Like captain Brian O’Driscoll, D’Arcy has failed to recover from a hamstring injury and has to step down. Munster lock Paul O’Connell will now take over as captain. Shane Horgan, who has been playing at outside centre, moves to inside centre where he will be joined by Ulster’s Kevin Maggs. Girvan Dempsey comes into the team on the right wing, while Gavin Duffy has been added to the replacements. “We gave him a shot but it didn’t work out,” said Irish coach Eddie O’Sullivan. “We had to be careful with it. He should be fine for the next game but we don’t want to tempt fate.” Maggs, who is about to win his 67th cap, was always the most likely to come in at centre, while Shane Horgan was always going to be moved from the wing. The other change from the side that beat Italy last weekend is Johnny O’Connor in for Denis Leamy. O’Connell has won two caps since making his debut against South Africa in November. The team to play Scotland is as follows: Murphy, Dempsey, Horgan, Maggs, Hickie, O’Gara, Stringer, Corrigan, Byrne, Hayes, O’Kelly, O’Connell, S Easterby, O’Connor, Foley.

    "The FA says it will not file a charge following the tunnel scuffle between Arsenal and Manchester United. Vieira had earlier denied he had threatened Neville before the game, which ended in a 4-2 defeat for Arsenal. He also got into a spat with the visiting captain Roy Keane, and it was up to the referee, Graham Poll, to bring the two men apart. “The referee has confirmed that he was satisfied that he dealt with the incident at the time,” an FA statement said. It means that United's victory will not be investigated by the FA, whose new chief executive, Brian Barwick, was present in the stands. “They are big boys, and they can look after themselves,” Vieira said. “I had a word with Roy Keane, and that's all. But it's up to them, the players, to decide whether to play or not.” “They were the better side on the night and deserved to win,” Neville said. “There were a few things that happened before the game that were disappointing, but it was not something that detracted from what we did on the night.” “Especially coming from such a highly rated player as him. But it's a tough game, and we've all been playing it a long time.” Neville admitted that he had not enjoyed the match, which was marked by fouls and the red card shown to Mikael Silvestre for a headbutt on Freddie Ljungberg. “I thought it was a dreadful game in the first half, and it wasn't much better in the second half,” he said. “There is no place for that sort of behaviour in a football match.” Keane said Vieira had started the fight. “He wanted to goad our players and thinks that if you intimidate our players, he'll intimidate our players. I'm not going to let him get away with that.” Sir Alex Ferguson said: “Vieira was primed for it. I have heard different things. Apparently Patrick Vieira threatened some of our players and things like that.”",
    "This year a single player has dominated the men’s game, and one nation the women’s. After Roger Federer had been the first man since Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slams in the same season, Anastasia Myskina, the first Russian to win a Grand Slam, followed this up with two more, at the French Open and Wimbledon. In the meantime, Tim Henman had his best year, and Greg Rusedski had an excellent comeback season. Henman had the edge over his fellow countryman Rusedski on all three hardcourts and both won their events. Starting the year as world number one, holder of the Wimbledon and Master titles, Federer had a foretaste of his future dominance at the Australian Open. He destroyed his way through the field and beat Marat Safin in the final. Andy Roddick was the only man who posed a serious challenge to him at Wimbledon, and at the US Open it was Lleyton Hewitt who was swept aside by the champion. At the end of the season, Federer and Hewitt fought it out again for the title at the Masters. In Houston he won his 13th consecutive title, setting a new record for the Open era. His only major disappointment was to lose in the French Open to Gustavo Kuerten in the third round, and it will be Roland Garros that he focuses on in 2005. In the Olympic games he was beaten by an unknown quantity, Tomas Berdych, and Chile took all the gold medals with Nicolas Massu winning the singles and Fernando Gonzalez the doubles. Another title that looks out of reach is the Davis Cup, which Spain won 3-2 at home against the USA. Andy Roddick’s clay-courting record was mediocre and he lost to Nadal and then to Moya, the decider. Henman set a new record by reaching the semi-finals on clay at the French Open and at the US Open. The quarter-final loss to Ancic at Wimbledon was disappointing because of the way he played, but he hopes to do better next year. At the end of the year, Rusedski, number two in Britain, after being cleared of doping charges, was ranked 168, but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. The Russian women lived up to the great expectations of their peers and, apart from Maria Sharapova, all three Grand Slam winners, were victorious in the Fed Cup at the end of the year. But if the Russians rose to the top, it was as if the Belgians and the Williams sisters had fallen off a cliff. The only woman to resist the young guns was the veteran, the fabulously consistent, and unflappable, American, Lindsay Davenport. After Wimbledon she went straight to the top of the rankings ahead of Mauresmo, whose wait for a Grand Slam goes on. An unstoppable Justine Henin-Hardenne beat her compatriot Kim Clijsters in the Australian Open. A virus infection meant that Henin-Hardenne had a very poor year, although she did manage to win the Olympic gold medal. Clijsters had a worse year than Henin-Hardenne, with a severe wrist injury, then the news of her split from Lleyton Hewitt. She was glad to see the back of this year. And in their absence, Maria Myskina beat Elena Dementieva in a dull but historic all-Russian final at Roland Garros. At Wimbledon, Sharapova’s nerves of steel were on show as she beat both Sharapova and Davenport, but at the US Open she was too unwell and lost to a powerful and unflappable Svetlana Kuznetsova. Dementieva went on to lose in another all-Russian final, as her wayward serve became a talking point. With the Russians still progressing, the likes of Henin-Hardenne, Clijsters, Davenport, Mauresmo and the Williams sisters need to be fit and in the mood in 2005. The only man who might be able to challenge Federer might be their fellow Russian, Safin.",

    "It is true that since the birth of the web as we know it today, the idea of an Internet channel has been talked about. But the first attempts to set up such a service – such as Homechoice in the United Kingdom, which was launched in 1992 – were thwarted by the slowness of the networks. Now that high-speed Internet is starting to establish itself, and for millions of users it is becoming a necessity, the big telephone companies are keen to start shooting some pictures over the Internet. Competition from cable companies offering voice over the Internet makes them desperate to be the first to offer IPTV. The software giant Microsoft believes that Internet Protocol Television is the future of television, and that it is an essential part of its “connected entertainment experience.” “Telcos have been trying to move into the video space for a long time,” says Ed Graczyk, director of marketing for Microsoft IPTV, speaking to BBC News. “But the challenge has been the network, and until recently the technology hasn’t been ready. Compression technology wasn’t good enough, the Internet wasn’t good enough. But a lot of things have happened over the last 18 months to make it a reality.” Last year, he says, it was all about putting together deals and making alliances, forming the “IPTV eco-system.” In 2006, he says, things will be starting to happen, and he expects to see a number of new deals and launches. “It will also grow as the number of broadband users increases in South America and other parts of Asia,” he added. What the telephone companies want to do is to offer a “triple play” of voice, pictures and data over the same cable or DSL line. Some are talking about a “quadruple play” with mobile services added to the package. This is a new form of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators. According to the British research group TDG, there will be as many as 20 million subscribers to IPTV in less than six years. The big advantage of sending the picture down the same line as the data is that the Internet can offer a two-way relationship between the viewer and the “broadcaster”. They are hoping to get more interactivity, something like the bespoke channel-listings of the DVD, with many, many channels, and a viewer’s personal library of tens of thousands of hours of content, all on a click. They can also send high-definition programmes direct to the viewer, without the need for a special set-top box. But perhaps the most significant, although many will see it as a non-issue, is instantaneous channel-changing. Changing channels on satellite, cable or digital terrestrial is a time-consuming business. With Internet Protocol Television, it is possible to change channels in less than 15 milliseconds. “That gets applause,” said Mr Graczyk. “We’ve been thinking about this for a long time. We think this will be the way we’ll all get our TV in the future, but it’s a few years off yet.” “It’s the way forward, because everything is going digital. We’re talking about a whole new generation of digital content, which goes from your TV to your phone, your games console, etc.” The plan is for the company to make its new Microsoft IPTV Edition platform do exactly that, offering a full end-to-end solution for telephone companies. This new offering has been launched in the US with the seven largest telephone companies in the US and promises to serve the 25 million broadband customers they already have. In fact, according to Mr Graczyk, they have just done the largest-ever deal in this sector, with the SBC deal for $2 billion. But it’s not just telephone companies. To exploit the Internet, there are already several companies offering services which will put the viewer in control, and offer them services they’ve never even heard of before. Jeremy Allaire, the founder and chief executive of Brightcove, told BBC News that this will be “a new dimension” in the way IPTV works, because it will use the Internet as the “channel” to deliver not just a lot of niche channels, but also a lot of content that would never normally get shown on television. “We’re focusing on people who own the rights to the content, but don’t have the distribution rights, and they can’t afford to go through cable operators and so on. We are their only option.” The new type of service can also be used by more established publishers who have unique content that they can’t sell through the cable and satellite operators – the history channel, for example, and its archives, for example. It’s also a sign that the future is bright for IPTV that there are several other companies offering similar platforms, such as Myrio and C-Cor. But it will be up to the public to decide whether this will be a success.",
    "Former England captain Martin Johnson has announced that he will retire from the sport at the end of the season. In June he will play his last match. After winning 84 caps for England, he stepped down from international rugby at the beginning of the year, only two months after he had taken Sir Clive Woodward's side to victory in Sydney. The 34-year-old Leicester lock will play his last match at Twickenham on June 4. \"I'm sure I've made the right decision to retire,\" he said. \"I'm sure there will be times next season when I wish I was still playing for Tigers, but you know when the time is right to leave and I feel this is the right time for me. \"I'm sure I could still play for another season, but the Premiership is a full-time job and I want to be out there for the right reasons. \" He will always be remembered by England fans for the World Cup victory in Australia, but his achievements did not stop there. He was the only man to captain the Lions twice and he led England to a Grand Slam in the Six Nations. Also he had a hugely successful career as a club captain with the Tigers, winning the Heineken Cup in his first two seasons and a number of titles in the English league. In addition to being one of the best captains, he was also one of the finest locks to play the game. Teak-tough and imposing, he dominated rucks and mauls for the best part of a decade and was one of the reasons why England rose to the top of the world game. He will play his last match in his testimonial match, which he will lead to Twickenham against the Jonah Lomu side. The All Blacks star is planning to come back after a kidney transplant and the former England captain expects it to be a memorable match. Lomu, who was the first world-famous athlete after his achievements in the 1995 World Cup, said he was proud to be part of Johnson's retirement match. \"We hold him in such high esteem,\" he said. \"He is such a great leader and I am just honored to be on the same field.\"",
    "“Irreversible damage to the environment” will result from the government’s plans to build more than a million homes in the south-east, according to MPs. Plans for sustainable communities are being promoted without a proper understanding of what ‘sustainable’ means, the parliamentary Select Committee on the Environment said. Energy use and transport were not properly addressed. A government spokesman said the report had been written before new initiatives were announced. He said: “We are working with our colleagues in Defra to create cleaner, safer, greener communities, while protecting and enhancing the environment.” The report said there was too little attention paid to a range of environmental issues, including water, which is in short supply in some parts of the south-east. Building regulations to ensure energy-efficient homes are too lax and are routinely flouted, the report said. Funding for transport improvements is only one-fifth of what is needed. The report was a stinging rebuke to the government, and particularly to the department of the environment, Richard Black said. Peter Ainsworth, the chairman of the Select Committee, said: “The government’s housing policy is a shocking example of a lack of joined-up thinking in an area where a coherent policy is crucial. “I accept the need to improve the supply of homes, but the main beneficiaries of housing growth are going to be housebuilders, and the main loser will be the environment.” The report included several recommendations: The government should acknowledge the shortcomings of the Treasury’s Barker review, which said 140,000 homes were needed every year. The government should consider the introduction of a national spatial framework for England, similar to the ones in place in Scotland and Wales. The office of the deputy prime minister should do more to promote brownfield development and higher densities of housing. The government should set a timetable for zero-carbon homes. The government should make clear how it would measure success. Caroline Spelman, the Conservative minister for local government, said: “There is now a growing body of evidence that the government’s housebuilding programme is a complete disaster for the environment, a concrete scar on the face of the countryside.”",
    "Labour has unveiled the slogan that will form the basis of its general election campaign, which is, to use the popular expression, ‘looming’. “Britain forward, not back” (no, it is not one of the temporal mottos of some extra-terrestrial temporal philosopher) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky: always there but we no longer notice it. The word ‘Britain’ is on a red background – a tribute to the Old Labour. ‘Forward’, italicized and sliding cleverly forward, is on a drab green background. As one of the journalists gathered at the unveiling explained, it was all post-modern, something or other. The colours are – and I quote – ‘brilliant’. They’re not in the least wasted. Incidentally, the ad men responsible for the flying pigs and the ‘Fagin’ posters, which provoked protests from the Conservatives, are not being sacked, as the general election campaign director Alan Milburn has declared, but are ‘doing a very good job’. In his latest instalment of a series of pre-campaign public pronouncements, Milburn explained that the slogan was a reaction to the polls showing that the public saw Labour and Tony Blair as the future, while Michael Howard and the Conservatives were the past. Not many people, he said, talk about the “golden years” of the years before 1997. The campaign will be fierce, he said, because it will come down to a choice between Labour and the Conservatives. He declared that nobody would believe that it would be Charles Kennedy walking into Downing Street on the morning after the election. They could see it happening to Michael Howard, and of course Tony Blair. It was only right, he said, that the campaign should be concerned with scrutinizing the Conservatives’ record and their policies. Tony Blair would be in the forefront of the campaign. Between now and the election the Prime Minister will spend more time outside London than in it, but in the UK, not abroad, Milburn assured them. “He’ll be the one to lead the domestic debate, taking the flak, not ducking it.”",
    "The captain of the Reds, Steven Gerrard, said today that Liverpool had little chance of winning the Champions League. “We have to be realistic, there are some great teams left in the Champions League,” he said on BBC Radio Five Live. “We will do everything we can to get through as far as possible, but we know that this year might not be our year. ” Gerrard has never hidden his desire to play in the most prestigious club tournament in Europe. Last year he said that qualifying for the Champions League was the most important thing, and there are rumors that he will leave Anfield if the Reds fail to qualify. According to the rumors, Chelsea would be the most likely buyer. And today, when he was asked about Gerrard's statement that Liverpool was struggling in the Champions League, Jose Mourinho supported the idea. \"Rafa has time to build a better team, but for now it is a bit behind,\" he said. \"We still have a big two months. \" Gerrard, who was the first to score the goal that took the Reds to the last 16 by a fantastic performance against Olympiakos in December, said he still hopes to help the team to win this season. “We are fighting for fourth place, the final Champions League spot, and we are still in the two cup competitions, which are very important to us. We hope to defeat Chelsea in the final and then reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League because it is very important for the club financially and personally for me.”",
    "A group of Polish artists has taken the cacophony of noises produced by the constant thumping of the buttons of the little Nintendo console to a new level. The Blippop Orchestra has taken the sounds of these games and composed musical pieces that are like Donkey Kong meets Norman Cook or Tetris meets Kraftwerk. In any case, the sound is unique. All sounds come from six Game Boy devices, both older and newer models of the Nintendo Advance SP. The Blippop Orchestra takes these devices, tinkers with their software and then connects them to a mixing console. For years Jarek Kujda, one of the founders of the group, has been into both experimental music and video games. “Three or four years ago I was playing experimental music, and that was when I first started using a Game Boy as a drum machine,” Kujda says. He soon realized that the console could be used as a primitive synthesizer. So if one Game Boy could produce music, what would happen if he had six of them? Kujda gathered five people who were interested, and the Game Boy Orchestra Project was born. “The Game Boy Orchestra Project is a more improvisatory project,” Kujda says. “We prepare a few patterns before a concert, and then improvise during the concert.” The group only plays four or five concerts a year. “Malgorzata Kujda, Jarek’s sister and a fellow member of the band, describes a Game Boy Orchestra concert as an incredibly noisy event,” Kujda says. “For example, I play more of the heavy bass and distortion sounds,” she says. “But everyone creates their own music, their own sound. At the concert, we just improvise. I think that’s the most fun.” They say the audience reaction to the group is mixed. Some love the music, and others aren’t sure what to make of it. As far as a source of music goes, these Blippoppers are not alone. Jarek Kujda says a lot of people make music using old school computers—things like Commodore, Atari and ZX Spectrum. “We want to make experimental music and not just covers of other people’s music.” “We’re like an electro-jam band.” They’ve already put out a few tracks on the Internet, and the group is planning to produce a CD next year. They’ve even found a sponsor—the Polish distributor of Nintendo products. To be sure, the Game Boy Orchestra members are not likely to be displaced by any other game musicians anytime soon. A new Game Boy Advance costs about $200, which puts it out of reach of most Polish music makers.",
    "The pop singer, Delta Goodrem, was named best female singer at the first M-TV Music Video Awards in Australia, where the presenter was also the best male artist. Goodrem, who is known in Britain and Australia for her role as Nina on the “Neighbours” show, also sang a duet with her boyfriend Brian McFadden. Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas were named best groups, while Goodrem and the Peas won two awards each. Goodrem also won the Pepsi Viewers' choice award, while Green Day won the best rock music with American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won the best R & B and the sexiest music awards for their hit, Hey Mama. The local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins won the award for the breakthrough artist, while the best pop music was won by the winner of the Australian Idol show, Guy Sebastian. Cher was awarded the VH1 Pioneer of Music, which honors her achievements in the industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbor, hosted by the Osborne family. The live music program included Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osborne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia.",
    "Charles Kennedy tells the electors that his party will offer them a choice that is “honest” at the next general election. While the two big parties are competing to put on the lowest taxes, Charles Kennedy is saying that the Liberal Democrats are going to raise them. Having already adopted his party’s previous pledge to raise tax by a penny in the pound to reinvest in the public sector, he has now changed his mind. He wants to put a “moderate” increase of a penny in the pound on all incomes over £100,000. It will enable him to provide free student loans, free long-term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. This last policy will mean that around 3% of the richest will pay more, while the rest, pensioners in particular, will pay less. Both Labour and the Conservatives have hit him for these proposals, which they accuse of being unworkable and badly costed. It is therefore natural that they should say that it is not necessary to raise taxes to improve services. The Conservatives claim to be able to raise the services and reduce taxes by £35 billion of savings. Labour has put forward a budget of £22 billion but has not yet come forward with its own tax plans. However, unlike the old Tories and Labour debates, the Lib-Dems consider that the people are ready to support the wealthy with “moderate” tax increases to pay for the improvement of public services. It is an idea which is confirmed by the last polls which show that the people would prefer a higher spending on services than on tax cuts. As regards the issue of asylum and immigration, Mr. Kennedy claims that the politicians must not “foment an artificial debate” about the issue and attacks Michael Howard’s proposals for quotas. In the face of the two parties, which resound with the same voice, he is showing a different and more liberal approach. He is also very optimistic about the election campaign, saying that the Conservatives would not be a “significant” party in the elections. He is also repeating his refusal to form a coalition with either party after the election. It looks as if the leader of the Lib-Dems thinks he will have a privileged position after the elections. This is a dream that has often been dreamed of by a third party.",
    "This will not be remembered as one of Paula’s great marathons, but in the character department it was the most arduous race she has ever run. The victory in the New York Marathon does not make up for the disappointment of Athens, but it will make one feel more hopeful and confident for next year. Paula would have had difficulty looking ahead with optimism if her last memory of the year had been Athens. Now she can put a line under the year and make plans for the future. Even if she had lost this race, it would have been possible to learn a great deal from it. One would have learned that one can dig deep when one needs to. There was a strong field and a number of the girls went into the race with the intention of winning. And although 2 hours 23 minutes was not one of Paula’s best times, it was not far from the record on a difficult course. In the days before the race, Paula said that in a way she was not running the race. She said she was thinking that if she won they would say, “Why didn’t she do that in Athens?” If she had lost, they would have said that her career was over. And many people were wondering what would happen if Paula, as in the marathon and the 10,000 meters at Athens, was forced to drop out. But that was not to be. Even if she had been beaten, she would have carried on running. The things that had made her drop out at Athens—those injuries, the lack of energy, and the stifling heat—were not a problem in New York. The only question was what position she would be able to finish. But, most important, in spite of all the expectations in the newspapers, Paula never doubted. If she had not been confident, she would not have run. If one is the best in the world at something, one always expects to win. Now Paula will take part in the 10K run in London at the end of the year, then take a well-deserved rest over Christmas and start the new year with a good deal of hope.",
    "James Costin should have been paralyzed. He himself says that he was paralyzed by the accident that occurred nine days before the start of the race at the Olympic Stadium in Athens. He tells the story with a touch of irony, remembering his first thoughts after a truck driving in the wrong lane hit his rented car. “I had a lot of pain, I felt like one of my toes was broken,” says the Waterford man. “But maybe with a steroid injection, it wouldn’t matter. The back was like a fire. The muscles were ripped off the hip. But maybe, maybe, I’ll manage with laser therapy and ultrasonic, and I’ll run again.” Ten hours passed before James could tell himself that he wouldn't run in the second Olympic games. “The back was broken twice, the base of one of the vertebrae exploded, so I was pretty lucky that I wasn't paralyzed. I also broke my big toe, which was on the brake.” James didn’t get to Athens Hospital until ten hours after the accident. “For the first nine hours, they didn’t give me anything for pain, and it was ridiculous, it was 35 degrees. But after they took the pictures, after I saw them, I decided, 'This is my situation. Then, in three days, the ambulance took me to Ireland. The Greek doctors wanted to operate on James immediately, but he didn't want to do it until he came home, and he is glad of that now. “The Greeks wanted to put two or three inches of titanium rods along the spinal cord. They would have fused the whole lower back and I would never have been able to run again. But they told me that I could completely recover in natural terms, and this is an opportunity for me to run again, which is very important to me. “The Greeks put a lot of pressure on me to have surgery. The people at the Mater Hospital have been absolutely wonderful.” Three and a half months passed after the accident, and for most of this time James was in a cast, and after that six weeks on crutches and ten days without support. He was delighted to be able to walk without crutches. He was also delighted with his physiotherapist Johnston McEvoy in Limerick. “Johnston has done very well with acupuncture, and it has helped me a lot.” “They put needles on my backbone. Yesterday, I had a three-inch needle and I’m quite bad today. In addition, James was treated at the training center in Spala, Poland, where he has trained with three-time Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski for the past five years. “I was there for over two weeks at the beginning of September and did a pretty extreme treatment called cryotherapy. They have a room with liquid nitrogen, and it’s minus 160 degrees, and this gives a deep healing effect. James is going to Poland again on Sunday, where he will undergo cryotherapy twice a day, as well as physiotherapy twice a day and swimming pool work. These are all small steps on the way to what James hopes to race again next year. “I'm trying to get movement back. It wasn't very strong to lie down for three and a half months. I spend about six hours a day on physio and swimming pool work. I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to build up my muscles. I'm pretty full on in everything. By March I would like to be in training again, but that's just one step in the process. Whenever I move too much, my pelvis and lower back get stiff. It's about waiting to see how it responds. Maybe in four or five months my back will stop being so stiff.”",
    "Paula Radcliffe has decided that she will run in the Flora London Marathon this year, after deciding her program for 2005. The 31-year-old, who won in 2002 in her first attempt, won again the following year, and will be trying for a third victory on April 17. \"You can't get a better 25th anniversary than this,\" said race director David Bedford. \"Having already announced the greatest ever field of men, now we have the greatest ever field of women. Three years ago, Paula broke the world record with 2 hours 18 minutes and 15 seconds, then came back a year later and beat the combined record by one minute 53 seconds in Chicago in October 2003. After a difficult time in Athens, where she had to give up in the Olympic Marathon, Paula returned to win the New York Marathon in November. But he left the possibility of the \"Great City Marathon\" to try to get the \"Grand Slam of Marathons.\" London, Chicago and New York, the only other possible goal, but the Boston Marathon is held the day after London. \"Boston is a race I want to run, but London is a special race for me,\" said Paula. \"I don't choose races to avoid the pressure.\" I choose the ones I want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, the people, the course, and I know it's always a great quality race. This year it's the 25th anniversary, which makes it even more special.\"",
    "The fifth seed, Carlos Moya, was the first of the big names to go down in defeat at the Australian Open, losing to fellow Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez on Monday. The fifth seed, who had started the year with victory in the Indian Ocean, looked ill at ease from the start in the Melbourne heat, while Garcia-Lopez, ranked 106 in the world, took control from the first ball and held off a last-minute third-set rally to win 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. The 21-year-old Spaniard will now face either Kevin Kim or Hyoung Taek in the second round. He was thrilled with victory in only his third grand-slam match. “It’s the most important victory of my life, as Carlos is one of the best players in the world,” he said. “I’m full of confidence now. I think I can beat any of the top players.” Moya said he had been playing well before coming to Melbourne. “I had a perfect preparation, but today was not the day.” Four-time champion Andre Agassi began what could be his last Australian Open campaign with a thumping victory over Dieter Kindlmann of Germany. The 34-year-old American, who was recovering from a hip injury in the early part of the week, stormed to a 6-4, 6-3, 6-0 victory. “I was worried about the injury, but it was a lot worse than I thought it would be,” he said. “I’ve worked so hard to be here.” “But the last few days I’ve been pushing through it, and it seems to be OK.” In other matches, world junior champion Gael Monfils used a wild card to win a brilliant 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) victory over American Robby Ginepri, while 2002 runner-up Thomas Johansson came from behind to beat Peter Luczak 7-6, 4-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, and French Open champion Gaston Gaudio won 7-6, 6-2, 6-3.

    "Sarah Claxton, a hurdler from Great Britain, has great confidence that she will be able to win her first major medal at the European Indoors in Madrid in March. The 25-year-old has already broken the British record twice over the 60 meters this season, lowering it to 7.96 in the AAAs meeting. \"I'm pretty confident about it,\" said the athlete. \"But I'm taking it one race at a time. As long as I train enough and don't overdo it, I think there's a medal chance. \" Claxton has won the British 60 meter hurdles title three years in a row, but has not been able to pass on the national success on the world stage. Now, the Scottish athlete is among the five fastest runners in the world, and in the Grand Prix in Birmingham, she left the favorite of the Europeans, the Russian Irina Shevchenko, sixth. For the first time, Claxton has trained exclusively for the indoor season, which could explain the significant leap in her performance. In the past, the 25-year-old athlete jumped long jump, but after moving from Colchester to London, she decided to refocus. Claxton will know if her new training is paying off during the European Indoors on March 5 and 6.",
    "Nortel Networks has sharply reduced its profit for the 2003 fiscal year. In a much-anticipated filing, the company said it earned 434 million dollars (about 235 million pounds), down from 732 million previously reported. But these figures, revised following an audit that led to the resignation of the Canadian company's president, also indicated that revenues were about 4% higher than first thought. Nortel shares, which had lost almost half their value since the end of the year, rose 1.4 per cent on Tuesday. In January, the company announced that it had conducted the audit. In both the US and Canada, authorities are still conducting inquiries into the accounting procedures. Also, Nortel released new figures for the 2001-2002 period, which it had previously indicated were understated losses. \"We now have a solid foundation for the future,\" said Bill Owens, the president and chief executive. Nortel said that 12 senior managers, none of whom had been involved in the preparation of the figures, had voluntarily agreed to repay a bonus of eight million dollars. The company said these members of the management team shared the board's \"disappointment with the circumstances that led to the restatement. \"",
    "On Monday the shares of the German football club Borussia Dnustrihausen went down despite the club agreeing a rescue plan with creditors on Friday. The club, which has suffered record losses and has debts, said last week it was in a \"serious and potentially mortal situation with regard to the economic and financial situation.\" The creditors on Friday agreed to suspend interest payments until 2007. The news had pushed the shares up on Friday but they fell 7% in the morning on Monday. Borussia Dnustrihausen will also receive short-term loans. It estimates it needs almost 30 million deutsche marks to cover its wages and other costs until the end of the month. The club is hoping that all of its creditors will agree to a three-year delay in payments for the use of its Westfalenstadion. Since Friday, almost all the banks involved in its financing have met with club officials. But there are still three creditors who have not yet agreed to the agreement of Friday. One of them, the property investment company Molorsir, which owns the stadium, has a meeting of shareholders on March 14, and it is expected to discuss the rescue plan. As we have already seen, the chief executive, Gerd Niebaum, resigned last week. The creditors want a greater say in the running of the club. Borussia Dnustrihausen has also come under pressure to hire outside management. It had a record loss of 688 million deutsche marks in the year to June. And to make matters worse, Borussia Dnustrihausen lost 0-five to Munich on Saturday.",
    "An injury-time drop goal from Ronan O’Gara put Ireland to the sword over Argentina at Lansdowne Road. Argentina, who were magnificent, were leading in the last minutes. O’Gara scored all of Ireland’s points with two penalties and five conversions, and Ireland thus retained their unblemished record in the autumn series. Argentina, with their better drill and sharper players, upset the Irishmen early on with a try from Federico Aramburu, and Felipe Contepomi kicked 14 points. And indiscipline let Argentina fly-half Contepomi open the scoring in the third minute with a simple penalty. He scored again in the seventh minute, after the Irishmen had been caught in a line-out. Manuel Contepomi, in a beautifully executed move, broke the Irish defence and fed his midfield partner Aramburu to score under the posts. At last, in the ninth minute, O’Gara put Ireland on the board with a drop goal. Two minutes later, Contepomi landed his second penalty. Ireland, playing against the strong wind and driving rain, were second-best in every contest, and they lost possession in the tackle against a rugged defence. O’Gara scored a second penalty in the 36th minute, but Contepomi landed another penalty in injury-time. The second half started as the first had finished. O’Gara scored a third penalty in the 45th minute, but Contepomi responded with a penalty of his own three minutes later. The Argentine pack was so powerful Ireland had no time to settle. The three-quarters had no room to manoeuvre. Ireland were forced to rely on O’Gara’s boot to keep them in the game. He scored two more penalties, one from 48 metres, to bring the score back to 13 with 13 minutes to go. Then Ireland got their chance, when Gonzalo Longo, the Argentine No. 8, was sent from the field with six minutes to go for a slap at the line-out. O’Gara’s boot swung the ball over the bar for his fifth penalty, to set up a nail-biting finish. Then, with two minutes left, the Ireland scrum got up and down the field, hemmed in on all sides, but with coolness and determination they brought the ball down the field and O’Gara thumped a second drop goal over the bar to complete a magnificent, if somewhat fortuitous, comeback.",
    "A limit on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, according to the elections supervisor. Fears that big donors could influence politics by influencing politicians have led to the cap being proposed. In a new report, the Electoral Commission says that it is worth discussing a £10,000 limit in the future, but not now. Also, more state funding for parties and more freedom for candidates in election campaigns. It says that in 2001-2002, £67 million was declared to the parties for the three-year period, with almost £8 million in donations of more than £1 million each. The report says that public suspicion of parties continues, despite the transparency of who is paying what. The limit would mean giving the parties more state money, which first has to be agreed and proven to work. \"We are not opposed in principle to the introduction of a donation limit, but we do not think it would be wise to make such a radical change from the existing system at this time,\" the report says. If there were to be a limit, it should be £10,000, which is a small enough limit to be effective, but which would have been £56 million in 2001-2003. And the commission recommends that parties seek more small donors and suggests that tax relief should be granted on donations under £200. Also, the state should provide more money for parties so that every party with at least two members in the House of Commons, the European Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly gets help. And it also wants to promote elections and thus increase voter participation. All local election candidates should be allowed to send out election material for free by post. The election budget should be moved from national to local level to improve contact between voters and politicians. The report recommends doubling the amount of candidate spending and reducing national spending from £20 million to £15 million. The election limits for general elections should also apply four months before the election, as is the case with all other elections. Chairman of the commission, Sam Younger, said: \"There is no doubt that political parties have an important role in strengthening the health of our democracy, and to do this they need sufficient resources. \" Our research shows that people want to know more about party politics and see politicians more accessible. But they are also reluctant to give the parties state money and at the same time unhappy with big private donations. We therefore recommend an open discussion about party funding in order to get the consent necessary for radical changes to the system.\"",
    "For a long time now, the makers of the world’s tv, film, and game industries have been preparing for a revolution in quality for what appears on our screens. It’s called high-definition, or HD, and it’s already hugely popular in Japan and the US. In the opinion of experts, it will do for images what the compact disc did for music. Though, as I said, you need a new set that can receive the HD signals, and they’re expensive. It will be at least 2006 before HD becomes a commercial success in Europe. But Europe’s gamer-fans may prove to be the first consumers who will drive the demand. For you to see the HD images you have to have a receiver that can cope with the high-quality resolution. The next-generation consoles, however, are expected to be launched towards the end of the year or in the first quarter of 2006. Most new monitors and plasma screens can already cope with such high-quality images. For the next generation of consoles, support for high-definition is mandatory, the games director of digital content group THX told the BBC. All games will be playable in high definition. So consumers who have spent all that money on an HD set and have nothing to watch on it will be blown away by these superbly clear images. It will change the way people think about playing games. At the end of last year, Sony Europe president Chris Deering predicted that there would be 20 million HD sets in European homes by 2008. Previously, market research company Datamonitor had predicted a mere 50,000 sets at the end of last year, rising to a staggering 4,650,000 by 2008. But why should Europeans bother buying such expensive technology (about $4,000) when there’s not much to watch on it? Sky is planning to offer HD services in 2006, and the BBC intends to produce all its content in high-definition by 2010. Until the rights, formats, and the logistics of introducing the technology are settled, the number of programmes available on tv will be limited. Of course, every tv picture is made up of horizontal lines and vertical pixels. Most British standard tv sets have a picture resolution of 625 horizontal lines and about 700 vertical pixels. The high-definition image has up to 1080 active lines, and each of these lines can contain 1,920 horizontal pixels. So the image is up to six times as sharp as on a standard tv. “For the time being in Britain it will probably be only games that can be shown off, until the broadcasters get the hang of it,” says Dr Tuffy. But in that respect they’re ideally placed to be the target audience for high-definition, because they’re always looking for the best possible resolution, and the most engaging and exciting gaming experience. The gaming audience is the “sweet spot” for the industry. The best-quality games are developed for those aged between 25 and 34, who are likely to have more money and therefore be able to afford to buy large high-definition screens and high-definition projectors earlier than others. They’re also going to want to play games on the next-generation consoles, which are expected to use a larger capacity disk format, such as HD-DVD or Blu-ray. This will make it easier to produce more detailed and realistic games. The high-definition format does have a number of production implications for game-makers. It might make game-making more expensive, says Dr Tuffy. “And you’re going to see cross-platform development, where they can adapt a game from the PC to the console,” he says. “A Lord of the Rings game, for example, will get closer and closer to the film itself, particularly with all the special-effects from the DVD. And the transition between the film sequences and the game will be pretty seamless.” In high-definition, it will be seamless and just as good as the experience you have at the cinema. This may lead to greater convergence between the film and gaming industries, although not until the generation after the next-generation consoles. “It’ll be more like film,” says Dr Tuffy.",
    "In the meantime, however, Real Madrid's Beckham has no intention of becoming a coach. \"I don't want to be a coach, but I would like to run schools, I've wanted to do that ever since I went to Charlton's school.\" Beckham plans to open one in London and another in Los Angeles. \"My other passion is the benefit of the poor — I am an ambassador for Unicef and it gives me great satisfaction.\" However, he stated that his priority was winning the Spanish title with Real Madrid. Real Madrid have now lost thirteen points to Barcelona, after losing 0-1, on Wednesday in Seville. \"It is very painful and frustrating to see the results with the team we have, because it would be great to win the title with Real Madrid — I've been here two years and we haven't done it yet.\" But in a long-standing interview, Beckham also stated that the dismissal in Argentina, and the storm that blew up as a result, was the most significant moment of his career. \"I think my dismissal in Argentina was the worst moment of my career — it was not just the dismissal itself, but the consequences that followed. I was lucky because I had Sir Alex, who supported me, and I had a strong family behind me, but I think it changed me.\" \"I think it changed me for the better.\"",

    "The August day you wake to is an astonishment. Black sombre clouds. Its bitterness. Breezy downpour. A thick slush envelops the rented cottage, the towels and the bathing suits hanging on the line. Dry-drained gutters gulp down the clear rain. Drops splatter from a leaking gutter with hard slaps of implacable force. You think with almost tender remembrance of winter, of the run from the fuel shed to the back door, of the slow ascent of peat smoke, of the smoke of the neighbouring stoves setting their own gloomy temperatures. As you sit there and think up ways to amuse the family, you can recall how barefooted games on dry sand had been postponed. Slot machines? A snack bar at a hotel? In truth, as you move the crumbs of your buttered toast around the uneven edge of the table, you’d rather go back to bed, as though you had a light illness and could be pampered with quilt, whisky and cloves. Let it rain. Let the clouds empty themselves like reserve tanks. Let the worms burrow up to the surface from whatever dark swamp they hatched in. Let the coffin-like boards of the garden shed rot. Let the shrubs slip out of their hold in the wind, the nettles lose their sharp edge, the wet-combed rat scamper back to its drain. Let the rhubarb leaves become a reservoir, a makeshift pond, a reservoir. Let the patter of rain on the workshop be like the applause on an old recording of a love duet. Let the bricklayers on the building site wrap their dejected sheets of polythene around their doomed foundations. Let the limb of the tree, ripped out of its socket, float for a moment in the air, like an olive branch. Let the tail of the rainbow spread out like a bird of paradise. Let the inundations subside. Let there be light.3 A thunderstorm has lost its wind, but nature, which does not like silence, fills the void with birdcalls. The hen, forsaken in her narrow, airless brooding-place, repeats herself ad infinitum. Hearts are being refilled like the rain-barrels. The hammers are back. The hum. The gossip. The snore. The sun is strolling down lanes overrun by grass, drawing attention to the carved-brass finials on the hotel where the chambermaid, the window wide open, is relishing the fresh, reborn world. Convalescence for the body and the spirit. Will we ever feel more reconciled with life, or know a more hopeful moment? How easily pleased we are. We forget, for a second, the dark nights of the soul when wind-driven lightnings set the flames of brimstone alight. Sadness is the perennial mistress; happiness is a rare flower, perfumed the air, so that our breathing is as easy as the breathing of a chest decongested with camphor. Relief is ecstasy, until death finally makes it disappear, offering us complete relief.",

He needed food to become stronger, And he had no food. The little girl was left alone, In the darkness. She was holding her arm, On which there was a mark. Her wrist had been used to extinguish a cigarette. Her flesh was cut, leaving a bruise. He had been kicked while he was lying down, Kicked for being there, Kicked and thrown down. She had been the person, Only for her parents, Whom they themselves could injure when they were at home. They had been abused, Both outside and inside. Their pride had long since gone, And they could not even stand up, and simply say no! They died, when they were still only three. The little boy was protecting his sister, The little girl was clutching her teddy. They had marks, On their arms. But they had been rescued, Saved from further harm. I wish that I had had the courage, to have told someone, About the torture they were suffering, Each week. I could have changed everything, For this little boy and girl, Changed everything so that they could change the world. So if you know of any case, Of abuse, Call the helpline, Tell them today, Before a life is lost.",
    "The butterfly was young, its delicate wing lace; the cricket was agile, croaking a song. The butterfly swayed and stopped on a rose, spreading its delicate wings, slowly sipping the sweetness. The cricket hopped up and down, and the butterfly was looking far away.",
    "Poverty seems to be a repellent stuck on the poor, whose only fault is that they have no possessions or wealth to show off. Among wealth admirers and worshippers who find poverty disgusting, the prurients of wealth seduce them, stripping the poor of the dignity that they possessed, as though the fleas of poverty were borne by them on purpose. And the fruits of affluence are sown and sown with utter scorn, degrading the human warmth into little more than a mere dog's drool, where the fruit of affluence is sown. Diminishing human dignity, which the simpleton equates with possession, in turn degrades and emasculates the simpletons of the spheres of affluence. And poverty lays bare, like the leprosy of humanity, the lack of perspicacity and sagacity, concealed by the lack of humility which often mars affluent circles. Like a dilute influence, the proponents of wealth see, without thinking of it, as it were, the power which the poor exercise to reveal the unity of humanity, stripped of wealth, affinity and mobility.",
    "Far north there lies a land, a marvelous land which the wind blows over. This is a great, gray, chaotic land, where everything is open and nothing is moving. There the restless traveler's soul is frightened by the sphinxes of Nature. But nature is not indifferent to her victims, and the ancients' sacrifices are demanded. So these gray rivers slowly glide along, sloping with languor, splashing in the reeds on both sides, bending towards the North Ocean. The plains, on which the emus pass, are gray; the grass, perhaps, a little greener over the dead; down there in the world where people are working, Dame Nature smiles as the hands of people have taught her; only the dead have the right to her smile in the wide desert land near the gray gulf. For the strength of a man is the strength of an insect before this great plain and river, and the life of a man is only a moment before the life of the eternally running current. So they do not take part in the small world's worries; every stout traveler rides like a paladin, cheerful in his soul, with plains around and blue sky above. And the brown lark sings, singing the songs that the strange wild country taught her; with grateful thanks, the sweet song rings - and I wish I was again at the gray gulf water.",
    "The little power we have we give to others They govern our lives and we follow their orders The media they control and only their lies are for us, They warn us about terrorists and terrorism and fill our hearts with fear Of strangers we do not know and whom we may never meet They make us look at each new acquaintance with suspicion, Though they may be good people and fair and just They are our enemies yet we think they are our friends For their political survival, they depend on our fears And our enemies, our leaders are the same They make them fear us, they too play the game of power. We are ruled by selfish men who use us to deceive us, When they tell us who to fear they have us in mind And they tell us with a smirk that God is on our side. To lie to keep power they do not consider sin, Some call it propaganda, others spin And when the civilians of our enemies die in a bombing raid, ’tis but a collateral damage, as they say Is it fair that human life can be dismissed in this way? The little power we have is never ours We give it to the power-hungry, deeming it worthless, And they spread the fear in our hearts to keep their power, In a garden full of weeds we may find no flower.",
    "Amidst innocent women - innocence, innocence, how to stay calm, and to know a place of peace. Innocence, innocence, the lies I’ve told - can the earth hold me? Innocence, innocence, who’s dragging you down? Failed by the system, innocence was taken away from me. I long for it back every day as I lie crushed under the earth. I might have survived if innocence had stayed - my refuge, my ground, my roof that was meant only to protect me. When I looked you in the eyes, you had gone to seek wealth and left me in an empty chamber filled with only anger. It’s just a rage to be taken out of my misery and released from this cage. Innocence, innocence, how can I bear this? Innocence, innocence, who’s pulling you down? Innocence, innocence, why does my freedom have to be destroyed over something material? A negative, inner emotional existence. Innocence is a very strange thing. Looking at my situation and realizing that nothing will change. Pure injustice is not the same as innocent freedom. Taking mental pictures, putting them in a frame. When they enter hell, I hope they’ll be burned in the flames. I’ll never be the same. To death what is victory? To enslavement what is a chain? Innocence was slaughtered when they called my name. I begged for a change, and they gave me death. Forget my innocence, they’ve forgotten me. Freedom is a game they’re playing with tricks and I’m left to laugh. On this slab, on my way to the chopping block, reaching out for my innocence, I feel the dull thud as they step on my chest and touch my face. ... Is it God or innocence that I seek? Innocence, innocence, why do I weep? Innocence, innocence, where is the truth in the midst of lies? Innocence, innocence, can greed hold me? Innocence, oh innocence, who’s dragging you down?",
    "My pillow is drenched, my eyes are crimson. My soul is aching, stricken. I ought not to have heeded my heart’s warning. I am the victim of love. I am weak, I am a dove. Sweep me away, scold me, put me to death, I am sorry that I have loved you on this earth. I beg you, stretch out your gentle hands, pull out my guilty heart, burn it, melt it like ice and suck it dry. Only when my heart is pure can I stop loving you. You are a snapshot of the heavens. I cannot take my eyes off you. I have chosen you. I shall love you now and when I am no more. Your beautiful smile will inspire me all my life. I am crazy about your eyes, which have so many things in common with heaven and the skies. Release your soul and let it embrace mine, this is how I felt when I saw you for the first time. When I touch the softness of your rosy lips, my heart leaves its resting place in my breast. You are a symphony of beauty and ugliness. Hold my hand and walk with me, through the road of our destiny. I am old, a sick man, I am your tormented patient. Hold me tight, you are my last refuge in the path of love. Speak to me, whisper in my ear: Your soft, pleading voice is music to my ears. Love me, embrace me and make me happy.",

You should spend your next holiday in Iraq, with your wife and children. You talk of freedom for Iraq, and all you can say is “Iraq has freedom,” and daily we hear of dead Iraqis.

    "Father, I come to you again to ask you for more blessings. Oh Lord, I ask you for more blessings every day. Every day more grief, more devastation, more rapes, more murders. Opiate use increases instead of decreasing. Father God, people have forgotten their reason for being, they are lost. Father, your son asked you to forgive them because they did not know what they were doing. Father, when will they understand what they are doing? I struggle, Father, to read the newspaper and to hear of murders, of a body found close to the spot where a woman was raped and stabbed to death. Father, what sort of people are they? Satan is very active and still finds followers. I am very worried about the minds that he is still able to poison. Father, I pray that you take total charge and stop him, that you will make these people stop and think before they act, that you will make these people who may be suffering from mental illness seek help and let the medical doctors do what they are best at. Father, we need people who can show sympathy, love and care for others and not think of hurting them. Father, you are much stronger than this wicked person; I beg you to teach him a lesson. I know you hear me, Father, and I know you will deal with this evil, when the time comes, and only you know when the time is. I will never question your decision-making process, and I trust you. Father, I pray that I will see changes for the better in my lifetime. Father, let me see people hugging and caring for each other, instead of beating and killing each other. You are the greatest, the most wise, the King of Kings and I will always trust you and follow you. Father God, I truly trust you and I will always follow and love you. Father, I ask all this in the name of your precious son Jesus. Amen. Written on February 24, 2008.",
    "You young fellows, who to-day are skirmishing in your father’s loft with bows and arrows and wooden lances, playing at the Royal Welch Fusiliers; happy though you are, who has warned you how all games end? From the first time that you bend and swing Your spears of wooden curtain-rod, From the first time that you draw and slash Your bows of garden ash, Or fit a feather to the end of your arrow-shaft, You are bound by fate to be brave and true, As champions of this stony earth, Faithful and true in all things, pledged to serve your army and your king, ready to die, starve and sulk under some glare foreign sky, if only to keep the happiness of English boys. The war will soon be over, A worse, a more glorious war; Then, boys, you will play the whole game, The cruelest team will win. Hold your noses to the stench, and don’t stop to think; Wars change only in name; The next one must go the same way; And new crimes, which no one had dreamed of, will win and justify this war. Kaisers and Czars will strut and reel Once more in their pomp and greed and rage; Courtly Ministers will stop at home and fight till they die; In some new dreadful agony, men will die by the million, And children here will thrust and shoot, Die, laugh and die, playing at the Royal Welch Fusiliers.",
    "Who will marry the old lady's youngest daughter, the captain? And who with a glass of beer will set up a groomsman in her yard? He moored his boat by a stake in the water and staggered with a sailor's legs into the hall, where he met her lady-in-waiting, round-skinned and no longer so pale. Or a thrifty burgher in boots and fancy tuxedos with a view to marriage? He was overwhelmed by the neat scullery maid, who kept the house from becoming worse and filthy; but a wife does double work and takes no pains, so he rode her home in his carriage. No, never the gaunt young scholar, who was their second choice; They had him wait in the crypt of the old library, And found him compromised with a Saxon book, Claiming that his true love, learning, kept this nook and promised him sweet pleasure. Desirée, christened with her mother's grace, will never marry, Though the fairest child of her womb. We'll take our revenge, said the offended lady. The nunnery will be your bed at the top of the stairs, and we'll say to the bad lovers, She's not at home.",
    "This poem was written by a dying girl in a hospital in New York. It was sent to me by a doctor— all because of the word “Rain”! The day you came into the world, the time you could not wait for me to get old, when you were allowed to go slowly through the gardens and enjoy the butterflies? Let's dance slowly, the music is short-lived. Are you running through your days like a butterfly? When you ask: “How are you?” do you hear the answer? When the day is over, do you lie in your bed, with the next hundred things running in your head? Don't dance so fast, time is short. Music is short-lived. Did you ever tell your child: “Tomorrow we will,” And did not see his sorrow? Did you ever forget, let a good relationship die, because you did not have time to call and say hello? Slow down. Don't dance so fast. The music is short-lived. When you rush to arrive, you miss half the joy of being there. When you are worried and anxious, a day is like an unopened gift. Thrown away. Life is not a race. Take it slowly, hear the music before it's over.",
    "One day I sat in front of the mirror and conjured up a vision, bare and naked, unlike the bright and cheery ones that once reflected there—the vision of a woman who was lost, with more than feminine despair. Her hair sat wildly over her head, her face was ugly. There was no envy in her eyes to hide what no one had ever imagined. She was alone with no one, in a solitary grove, surrounded by thorns of wretchedness. Her lips were open and no sound came from between the red lines, Her hidden wound bled in silence. No sigh relieved her dumb pain, She had no voice to tell her fear. And in her dreadful eyes there was The dying flame of life’s desire, Mad because her hope was lost, And kindled by jealousy and vengeance, By strength that could not change or be weak. Shadow of a shadow in the glass, O set free the crystal face, Let it pass like all the other visions, Nor come back ever again, a ghost of a distracted hour, Which heard me whisper, ‘I am her!’",
    "Night that tears between you and you and you and you and me—jolts us apart like a man thrusting through a crowd. Among the sideshows, beneath the signs of moving pictures, pictures made of a million lights, giants that move and move and move again, amidst a cloud of heavy smells—hot dogs, roast chestnuts—or going up to some apartment, yours or mine, and finding someone sitting in the darkness: who is he, really? You turn on the light to see—you know his name, but who is he? But you can’t see. The florescent light dims—a pause. But you still have the command. The light reaches for each face and lays it out, mask by mask, before you. You and you and I repeat the gestures that speak when words fail. We laugh and say, “I”—meaning “you”—and I. Nobody.",

In order to learn what is right and what is wrong; to guide the masses with their all-accepting service; to enable them to enjoy the bliss of divine attributes, love, peace and forgiveness; God’s wisdom will enable them to know life.

    "All this was not my composition. I had been taken by the impression of love, and the overall composition was that of a master’s portrait, with all its parts, each in loving detail, the vein following the arm, from the large picture down to its small, insignificant details, which were like the more minute signatures of a secret signet, hiding in the inconspicuous background, like a little locket of a visible but barely perceptible locket. To the unseeing eyes of the world, the perfect melody I had played in my mind while the long fingers and polished fingernails were stroking the strands of hair. The moment produced only by the blast of beauty from the beloved Helios, For me, for me, how can I express my thanks but say “Thank you”? A brief ray, soon, soon, gone, I ask only the gods one more precious gift, given from their hands. Eros, beloved Eros, have my heart as long as his becomes mine, for I have no mind to give it to you, only so that I may render my song. A melody of my heart; let his youth be forever diamond-like, as my devotion to you. For one whole minute the entire world, all the incredible forces we dare not admit to existence, rearranged time and life to renew in one minute my soulless heart, to create the one measure of time that will forever and forever remind me how golden and brave love can be.",
    "Passion is the chief motivator to achieve greatness in life; The boldness of a great leader to accomplish a dream is because of passion; When passion leads, reason will take the reins. Do not underestimate the power of passion. Without passion, religion is without spirit; Without passion, history has no meaning; Without passion, art is without value. When one's passion takes over, there is no dream too big, no innovation unimaginable, no frontiers to be crossed. Follow your passion and success will follow you. Our passions are the winds that propel our ship, our reason is the helmsman who guides it. Without the winds, the ship will not move, without the helmsman, it will get lost. Follow your passion and success will follow you! Passion is the universal language of mankind; Passion is the spark that lights the genius.",
    "“How do you define a river? Is it just water, or water abounding in floods? A river is the life-blood of a nation; a river is the life-blood of my own soul. As the river travels along a long path to reach the sea, so shall I through this body travel towards my omniscient Master. My life is the purest of all, look at it, see it; my life is unique, highly developed. It is I who must flow unimpeded, to my omniscient Lord.” My dear, I have experienced every season, every whim, every desire; I have sailed the rivers of sorrow and happiness, and have flowed with the river of time to find salvation here. In the course of my eighty-four thousand births, I have arrived at the threshold of my present life; I have heard the words of my Lord, who said to me: “Flow on, river, into the ocean, and swell out into the deep. You are my Lord, my lord, you say! Flow, I say! I am with the river, to the ocean!”",
    "It really upsets me when someone doesn’t finish a thought and follows something I don’t understand. From my point of view it’s still over there, between the trees, or caught in the branches—this is something they felt I had to know, something that they felt I had to know about. Children are pointing somewhere now, and the kite, with its destination and duration unknown, is floating up there, high above their heads. But then they stop and close their mouths, all unaware or else in denial of the fact that they let the kite hang uselessly somewhere in the still obscure sky. The sun reflects mutely off its bare bones and the taut membranes, the uncaught kite can float forever, like an airmanless or unmanned aeroplane, but its seconds must be numbered. And the unknown colours and the possible direction nag at me like a deathbed confession that is never uttered, or the tongue stuck permanently to the palate. Somewhere it’s now burning with a dull glow, and its small trail of fuel is a black blob on the horizon. The treasure is gone, the information never came—no one was saved. No one was saved.",
    "Leander. No more of Memphis, of her kings mighty, of Alexandria, where Ptolemy taught commerce to spread out her pearls, and made wisdom smile; no more of Greece, where the world was made to shine by the light of wisdom. No more of Athens, which saw its geniuses rise up: the free-thinking Plato, the mighty Socrates, who with irresistible eloquence revived the spirit of liberty and shook the thrones of Macedon and the proud King of Persia. No more of Rome, enlightened by her splendor, rekindling the fire of eloquence, of divine poesy; of the mighty empire of Rome, whose broad dominions extended over half the globe, whose eagle flew eastwards as far as the Ganges, and westwards as far as the British isles. No more of Britain and her kings renowned: Edward, Henry, those thundering kings of war, of her kings victorious over the French foe; of her illustrious senators, of immortal bards, of wise philosophers, no more. But a theme newer and not less noble, the rising glory of this new world, where now science reveals her light to the East and wakens the Muses to song; where freedom lifts her sacred banners high, where commerce floods her golden waves with every joy of life, where liberty is reigning supreme. Since you, Leander, are trying to catch the echoes of a new time, full of fame, and a friendly company, where the sons of America gathered together, begin, O Muse!” And would you review the days when first Columbus touched the shore of an unknown land, when he braved all kinds of trials and dangers, hunger and death, wand’ring over oceans bearing perpetual storms. But, haply found, why should we resume the story of Cortez, the furious chief, who was consecrated to dye the sands of the Indians’ land with their blood, to fill with dead bodies the streams of renowned Amazia, which had not yet been explored? Or why, once more, repeat the history of Atabilipa, whose appetite for gold deprives her of life, which neither Peru’s rich ore, nor Mexico’s vast mines, could redeem. The newer kingdoms, those to the north, well deserving to be told, those discovered by Britain for her children, those unsoaken by the seas of Indian blood, which cruel Spain shed in the lands of the south, to win by the sword what the generous heart might win by fair treaty and without bloodshed. High in fame is that mighty hero who stands, Who, from the shores of Europe, took the first step to sail across new seas, new oceans, yet unexplored by man.” “Bold Hudson straying to the pole, Thro’ the cold north sea, To the indignant, choppy, turbid waves, Where Europe and America oppose their shores, Where confined and indignant the northern sea roars between. Not less would the Muse celebrate the noble deeds of illustrious Raleigh, the great hero, whose unfortunate life deserved to be recounted. Let a muse still young borrow from your fame to grace her humble song; there are many nobler poets than you who have sung your virtues, Envy can no longer darken the memory of your virtues, They are poured a new lustre upon Britannia. And the Atlantic, bold and fierce, Forsook the dangerous floods, and saw fair Virginia hail’d. The simple natives beheld the canvas rolling, And gazed away at the dark shore. For in her woods, America held a savage race of men from the beginning. How should we know, how could we tell, Where the Indian tribes arose?” Intractable, it has long defied the sages’ skill to investigate it, For tradition hides that mighty secret from all mortal eyes, How the nations first appeared, of south and north, And where they came from, what nations. Whether from some primordial head, In their own lands, like Adam’s in the east, Which the sacred oracles deny, And reason would oppose the thought. For when the general deluge had engulf’d the world, Where had their tribes found shelter? Where could they have found their fate, but in the ghastly deep? Unless, as some imagine, some chosen few High on the Andes escap’d the general death, High on the Andes in endless snow, Where winter reigns in the wildest rage. But here philosophers depreciate the idea, the earth, and hills and mountains, nay the whole world, knew not the universal flood, but when the waters had mount’d, rolled up by the winds, they shook and tore the drowned world, ’til the world, all-consuming, retreated, And left its ragged bed to be seen. And mayhap, on a journey, e’er reaching the north pole, the icy range of the seas, And Greenland’s east coast near the northern compass of America, the brave tribes of Israelites, Tartars, Tartars, came, over the ice-ridges, or by rafts, to those shores, first hidden from the world. In Peleg’s days, So says the inspired Hebrew writer, the earth was cleft in two—cleft eastward and westward, While the deep Atlantic rolled between. And traces, undeniable, remain, Of that unhappy land now drowned and lost; The isles that rise from the Eastern mains, are but the small fragments of that continent, the two extremities of which were Newfoundland and St. Helen’s: one, where the British seaman, with strange astonishment, sees the pole star shine above him, The other, at the head of the southern tropic, Where now the Pole-star seems to him like the sun: the second in the tropic of the south. The Bermudas, and Canaries, and Britannia, and Azores, and the famed Hibernians, were broken pieces of the same, and both are but fragments of a prodigious continent, that nourished armies, where now only ships pass. ‘Tis human fancy delights to wander, And longs to penetrate the secret of nature’s soul; He thinks his mind, with unshakable haughtiness, may ascend e’en to Heaven. Take, then, your broken isles, Your Northern Tartars and wandering Jews, And listen to what history reveals. Their ships, venturous and venti, Sail’d through the straits of Gibraltar, ’cross the western coast of Africa, to the islands of the sun, By them called the happy Isles— Flaccus sings, ‘cause they sported eternal spring; They clad the earth with fruits delicious all the year round. From such a voyage, this I conjecture: Some barque, with all her crew, Caught by the eastern trade winds, was carried before the steady blasts to Brazil, to the Amazon, to the further lands of the south. They stood there, and could not return; They had lost their land, and their skies. And many years past, a number grew, And spread them round the coasts; Those we call now Brazilians, Mexicans, Peruvians rich, The tribes of Chili, Paraguay, and those who till the shores of the long-flowing Amazon. When the first forces of Europe first reach’d these lands, How vast were their empires, and their kingdoms, and cities, and palaces, And how cleanly adorned were the nations, When the arms of haughty Spain broke up the quiet lands of the South? This discussion leads the confused mind from one eyrie to another, to question after question, more perplexed than ever. But this is clear: If from the east they came, Where science first, then revelation beams, Long since they have lost all memory, all trace Of their first stumbling block: Tradition tells Of some great ancestor beyond the lakes Oswego, Huron, Mechigna, Champlain, Or down the Amazon, which rolls Through many a clime, While others merely dream, That from the Andes, or from the North, some hoary fabled ancestor came to people their world. LEANDER. Oh, how dark is human nature! ’Twas here perhaps a wigwam stood, With all its savage inhabitants, or round Some mighty fire a hundred savage sons danced and cried by night; How different to the brutal race That had fled before them through the wilderness, Where were all the numberless red tribes that swarm From Baffin’s Bay to Tierra del Fuego to the Oronoque. In what superior fashion to the brutal race, That fled before them through the unbroken wilderness, Were all those numerous red tribes that swarmed from Baffin’s Bay to Tierra del Fuego, from California to the Oronoque. Unknown to fame, their life was careless, in ignominious ease. No lofty science opened to them, nor holy truth lifted the soul up to God; No fixed home was known to their wandering spirit; No golden harvests crown’d the fertile glebe, No city adorned the river bank, No rising tower crowned the stream. You see the scene change; The seafarer now sees our mighty towns, hails the land’s view and beholds A new, a fertile world, springing up; Commerce’s fair white sails gleam on the sea; Science lifts up her head, grace smiles on man; And peace, established by terrible war, improves the splendor of this ancient time. But let us trace, friends, the steps By which this recent happy world has risen to this eminence of high renown, to this high estate of wealth, liberty, and fame. Leander, I have heard you, Eugenio, narrate the happy story of the first discoverers of this happy shore; the fair history and the glorious cause which first led our fathers To visit the untried climes and the wilder forests, than Tartarian and Norwegian had seen; and to enrich the soil with lovely culture. The sun towards the west moves faster; no story or verse can stay its course, not the one which sang the fall of Troy and the stream of Sccamander. But let us follow a part of it: By persecution, oppression, and popish cruelty, our fathers came from European shores to seek this blessed country, to find a shelter from tyranny and hateful men. So they left their fathers’ homes and their friends, and plowed the seas in search of peace, They found new shores, and sylvan settlements, raised by each adventuring chief; Who, hot in their enthusiasm for liberty and freedom, Seek’d out untouched tracts, untrodden wilds, And framed new plans of cities, governments, and provinces. In that first and fatal year of discovery, they found no more to ask than the young Canadian, who discovered and founded New France, or the Virginians, who founded the cities of St. Augustine and Charleston. But what was the result, what was the outcome, of all that suffering? And what blood was shed, and what Indians slain, before the peaceable time was fully returned to our fathers? By countless inroads on new paths, By a series of traps in the forest, And unprotected landings on the land... Once, at Monangahela, at the source of the Ohio, A stout hero fell in valor and died in the open plain; His soul was too generous for those base bandits, who kill in secret and hate the day. And he asks our song of Monangahela, the bloody stream: The bellowing tribes, from the dark groves, the heavy hills, Assault the invaders, the savage horde. What then, O Braddock, the flame, the generous flame which shook your valiant soul? What then, the armed men of Britain, the most noble of her state? The savage foe, In the woods, lying, secure, What could the brave Virginians do, overpowered by such huge numbers, and with their chief dead? In the midst of fire and death, they carried him from the field, where many a hero lay in his blood. “O Halkut, so valiant, so young, O Halkut, brave son of fame! We still regret this unripe fate, and the fair Albion mourns this premature end, And Caledonia drops a tear for him, who led the most courageous of her sons to war. But why, alas, mention only the dead? Why disregard those glorious heroes who still breathe the same air and see the same light? Eugènio.” It is Acasto who is dead to us, and he who died yesterday is as much to us as he who died a thousand years ago. A Johnson still lives, he is a very well known man among the peoples, A patriot who is a master of all the magnificent arts of peace and war. He won for Britannia the savage race, insecure as the sea, fierce as the wind, cruel as death, and treacherous as hell. None but he had won them by benevolence; none could conquer them by humanity, before he rose up, He pity’d the unnumbered tribes, how unlike Cortez and Acosta, the pride of Spain, who were satisfied with blood and death. See their sad regions, smeared with ten thousand deaths, From Mexico to distant Patagonia, Where the howling winds beat against the southern cliffs, And other suns, other stars are born. Such is the curse of Eugènio, the absence of a human soul; but we have no cite of cruelty like Spain’s unfeeling sons. All the power of Great Britain, and our sons and daughters learn from us To conquer and spare; for cowards only take revenge on a vanquished foe. Gold, that fatal gold, was the tempting bait To Spain’s ravenous mind, thus came the wars, From Chili to the Caribbean Sea, above Terra-firma and La Plata, a waste of mountains, a waste of stones, of fields and plains. Those mighty lands, whose glorious past Was great Peru before, sunk in ruins, with magnificent cities and sublime monuments, the tops of which were erect. Had we but the happy choice of gold metals, of flaming diamonds, of precious emeralds, of blushing sapphires, chrysolite, jasper, of nobler riches than any which might have been found by a mining art, where every worker, the wife, the children, and the servants could find their daily bread. No one would enviously look upon their blissful bowers, as a Grecian muse envied their charms to a mortal race. Who was not a sage-minded man, A laborer in the fields, or one of the lawful kings, Who once exercised their regal hand, or those whose virtue raised them to the rank of gods? Imagine Laertes in his shepherd’s tweed, far from his pompous throne and his august court, working the soil where the west wind murmurs through the old trees, laden with red apples, fragrant peaches, and every kind of luxury the earth can offer; and, over the fields, the industrious oxen draw the plough. Vassius and Camillus, two Roman heroes, loved this life of rustic ease and sweet simplicity; escaping from the crowded Forum, they spent their age in the woods and the fields. How grateful to behold the crops rise, and see the golden fields sown, The meadows, bushes, and herbs, the calm grass, while the lowing herds graze over the grassy meadows and the bending grass, or slake their thirst in a flowing river. He lives in a thatched hut, he sits without fear of the storm, and the blazing fire cheers every soul, while a thousand faces are calm and serene; such is the lot of those whom heaven has blessed with a love of the country. Eugenio. Agriculture brings us so many blessings, It grows in the thickets of the forests; Palaces are raised in lands that had been empty or had been bleak wastes, where once only the tents of wandering tribes had been pitched to seek pasture, wandering from clime to clime. Then came the nations that hunted prey, swarming over hills and mountains, fierce as tigers or wolves. In Arabia, or in Tartar-land, where the plow never trod, No one could live there, but in our happy land it fills all the fields, from the shores of Maine to the Gulf of Mexico, from the shores of the Orient to the Mississippi. There is no famine, and plenty reigns, With plenty’s gifts raining down on our heads. A great Bellona, with her wild rage, withdraws to other seas, to the Danube, to the Straits which connect the Black Sea with the Aegean. The great Britannia reigns over the ocean, And calls every brave adventurer to behold the wonders of the Ocean’s domain. Our fleets far to the east are on their way to trade, And to the west they will cross the boundless seas, which old Rome, Tyre, or greater Carthage never knew. From the mighty Hudson’s deep-black depths the great city of New York arises, And her numerous ships of trade are born, Like shady forests rising on the waves. From the shores of Europe or the Caribes, yearly they return to bring the riches of those lands. This happy city of the muses, where science’s mysteries are explained, where the depths of the earth’s great learning are open to her sons. The great Newton calls them to join him, And traces the spheres’ rolling courses, and the countless suns and moons are displayed. And a school of philosophy! Blessed are you, America, with Liberty’s fair rays, And a ray of a milder religion. Nor are those alone, America, your sons have built, in the short span of a century, On your shady shores they raised and adorned with your blood. Of the numberless towns and villages, On the lakes and shady waterways, From the northern coasts of Nova Scotia to Pensacola, On the unfathomable coasts of the Indian Seas, on the fertile plains of the Mississippi. From trade, from trade they were nurtured, and with their help, the rich cities of the East may still rise and flourish, Because commerce is the source from which all nations draw the streams of their wealth. It is commerce which binds disjointed worlds, Confines the Ocean to narrower limits, and makes half the world her own. Since the earliest ages of man, On trade’s savage course he’s stretched his nimble sail, or sent the caravan slow and worn with age, over desert wastes and eternal sands, where human forms never appear, and there is not even a single tree, nor a lone cypress, nor the sound of a single fountain. It was thus that the golden ore of old Golconda was sent, and thus the riches of Ophir were brought to the wisest of men. Great is the praise of commerce, and the men Deserve our praise who ply it from shore to shore; the perils are many and great, and every wave’s a gaping grave, But the glory of these great deeds are due to science, Hail Science, the blissful gifts of Crete and Rome; The fair muses no longer stop at Chios, or the Olympus swathed in green woods; nor do they tread the summit of Hmus, where once the harp of sweet Orpheus once played, And so the soul of the wretched wife of Orcus was healed by his divine song; and all these great works owe their splendor to Science, a thing that hails from distant climes! And even now we can boast of an inventive Franklin, whose electric discoveries illuminated the bright flash of lightning, whose most recent inventions were displayed in the noblest halls of Oxford. And to this continent, they have reached, the latest, the best, where the Arts are just beginning to grow, and become Luxuriant and gracious, and even now we boast of an inventive Ben Franklin, versed in deep philosophy, a genius whose knowledge is as sharp as the electric sparks of the lightning, and whose understanding of the lightning reveals it all. And this is a land where everything rejoices, a land where Life, Liberty resound, Sweet Liberty. Without her, the noblest geniuses fail, and science is snuffed out forever. Acasto. This is a land where the noblest light shines, the Star of Revelation; its beams shine upon us, as once upon Palestine, and on all the Gentile lands, where now the drowsy Turk lies, enveloped in a blanket of obscurity. As lighted lamps have given light to men. O Whitefield, the darling of Heaven, I dedicate a tear. That thy language, laid in the dust, no longer reaches the slumbering soul; no longer does thy bold imagination depict the horrors of the shades; nor does thy charity relieve the poor. Let Georgia mourn, let all her orphans weep. The melancholy lyre sings to the sighs from far away: “No pain is so great as that which mourns the departing souls of holy, just, venerable men. For them pity from Heaven flies, to illumine the way to God.” Eugeio. All the mysteries of the future await our eyes, But where, Leander, since we know the past and the present, where do we dare to see into the future? Shall we ask what empires will rise there, where there is now only a desolate, lonely expanse? Where the melancholy eye is waiting for the day when the sons of Great Britain will rule from west to east and north and south—from the Pacific to the Atlantic? Such a glorious theme, but how can mortals pierce into the mysteries of the future and unravel the plots of Fate? If we had been enlightened by the bright coal snatched from the altar of the Seraphs, if we had been enlightened by the spirit of Jeremy and Amos. We would have known how to seize the helm of the mysteries of the future and to steer the ship of our imagination, but, however, I will not call upon the Muse, and we shall see how she will guide us. I see, I see kingdoms risen and kingdoms being built, cities and men, numberless as the grains of sand on the shore of the Ocean; and where the Ohio now weeps, there, too, shall rise many a town. And where the odious Mississippi now weeps in the midst of shady forests, peoples will rise, nations will grow, and states will rise, like those of Greece and Rome. We too shall boast of Alexanders and Pompeiius, of heroes and kings, slumbering in the womb of time, waiting for the joyous hour when life and light shall come to them. Oh, take us with you, O Muses, to the days when our sons will hear of us as of ancient things, as of the dawning of happy ages! How would I weep that we have been born too soon, at the dawn of happier times! For one or two, perhaps, our fame will not die. The sons of genius scorn to die, Immortal virtue is not denied to them, the Muses allow only those to slumber in the tomb who deserve the praise that virtue can give them. Eugeenio. What has been, shall be, and shall be, in the end will not remain on earth, but shall endure in the heart of the Muses. Though we have seen the great Empires rise in quick succession from the Assyrians, to Macedon and Rome, then dominion from there drove her chariot, and enlarged her sway over many isles, seas and inhabited lands; now, now, she has advanced to the West, to a new world; she has pushed onward to the shores of America, and made them the scene of the earliest marvels. Yes, far off, in the Arctic heavens, I see the spires of a Petersburg, Bergen or Archangel, shining with ice, Far to the West I see a new Palmyra or Ecbatan, whose ships sailed over many a kingdom, from the shores of the Pacific Ocean. Where they would carry silks from Persia, spices from Arabia, from the Philippine and Marian isles, or pearls and treasures from India, now to be found in the land of the Acapulcos. Far to the south I see a Babylon, as it was at the Tigris or Euphrates, with gleaming towers, and astronomers who would see God with telescopes, and conceive more splendid ideas of his glory in the blazing suns and dazzling stars, than poor Chaldean did naked-eyed. undulating with a thousand isles where gold-plated buildings glisten. The great nation that would rise and hold the whole continent will be that which farms the banks of many rivers, and with a crystal stream from the Apalachian hills, bathes the sands of Carolina and Georgia, and stretches from thence to the burning line of Saint John, Clarendon or Albemarle. And you, you Potomac, that runs through the virgin groves of Virginia, will rival the Thames, Tiber or Rhine, in commerce and commerce; because I see a hundred towns, and countless ships, and tall ships borne down with the tide. At distant epochs, far from their ancient banks, guided by a great king, they will have changed their course, or their cataracts will be cleared, and they will carry a thousand ships, carrying goods and men. And from the coasts of Labrador, the peaked islands, a thousand ships will push the wind and spread out their merchandise to the ends of the earth, or they will carry their roar through the world conquered. Laedner. And forever, here, beautiful freedom will reign. it is a great procession of patriots, a long procession of those who have fallen with equal fame as those who died at Athens or Rome. The sons of Boston, brave and firm, the great protectors of our injured rights, will fade away in the rays of these famous patriots and the heroes yet to be born. I see the happy age come, all lit up, all radiant with the brightness of the midday sun, I see Homer and Milton arise, with the pomp and majesty of the song, which gives immortality to the deeds accomplished by heroes in the fields of fame. A second Pope, like that Arabian bird of which each century can boast, may yet arouse the muse on the silent Schuylkill, and will make new forests bloom there. The rocky Susquehanna, in its bright meanders, which the nymph of the mountains first heard the inelegant music of my country poem, will still resound with a heroic song when some future Hambden rises to fame. And the transparent waves of the James, the Roanoke, will murmur like music in the wind; another Denham will celebrate them in gliding numbers, in harmonious and flowing poems. In the background of the Tuscororah hills, as on the slopes of the Pindus, new Theban poets will reach the heights and swim through the azure depths of the air. In the midst of the green shade of their thick groves, sweet music breathes through the darkness of the night, and they sing about the origin of those fair stars that gild the firmament; why the wind murmurs in the green woods; why the waters flow from the summit of the mountains, and the ocean is lower than the land. They sing about the final destinies, about the big result of our efforts here, about the last day of glory and the renewal of the world. These are their topics, because in this happy age, the enraptured bard disdains the ignoble anthem, renouncing smirks of mind, enjoying the perfect harmonies of souls; the beautiful science smiling, the glorious truth, the peace which has set the world at rest, the happy prelude to Emanuel's reign. Ah! in the time to come, (so sang the exiled seer of Patmos), a new Jerusalem will descend from heaven to our earth, perhaps this one, where millions of saints will be received, although a little late, with their almighty king, to live and reign a thousand years in this paradise, which will not be lost because of a second Adam. No toads shall grow, no briers, no thorns, earth's curse before, the lion and the lamb will graze in mutual friendship; the tame deer will graze with the tame tiger on high meadows, on high plains. Another Jordan will flow, another Siloah will gush from eddies, the trees of life will adorn their banks, the happy population, escaped from a second death, will find their safe rest, the waters, still green, will flow under the green branches where the happy people, free from a second death, will rest peacefully, for no terrible diseases, no fevers, no violent and slow consumptions, no cruel plagues will again renew the perpetual war of death. The music of charms will swell the lofty soul, the triumphant reign of harmony will reign in all the groves, the cymbal and the lyre will delight the fallen man. “Ah! Ah! what days the world will see when the future comes, and when only the years of bliss remain. Acasto! This is your praise, oh best clime! by science visited, richly furnished with all the luxuries of life. , the last scene of Time's effusion, the theater where the kings will come, the last theater where the winds will raise their fair scenes, the waters will gush forth in dancing cataracts, the rocks will grow manifold, the white and the black will have no duality, the days will have no ages, the suns will not die and the moons, which are sacred, reflected in the eternal calm of the blue skies, the mists will not fall, the mists will not fall, when the Last Ruins, in their fiery car, will travel over the creation, when all nature will fade in the womb of the night.",
    "My own, said the cat, stretching forth his gloomy paw. My lover, my friend, my slave, my plaything, said the cat, as he mimicked on his breast the gesture by which he sucked milk from his mother’s forgotten breast. Let us go into the woods, said the cat. I will teach you to read the odours, to become insinuated in the darkness, to wait like a trap, to hunt. Now I will lay on your doorstep this fat and warm mouse. You feed me, I will endeavour to feed you; we are friends, said the cat, although I am more equal than you. Can you jump ten times the height of your body? Can you climb trees, jump from roof to roof? Let us feel one another. My sentiments are as pure as crystals of salt, and as hard; my desires are as lucid as my eyes. I sing to you in the morning, as I walk around your bed and on your face. Come, I will teach you to dance as easily as to sleep, wake, and stretch yourself out. I speak of greediness with my paws, and of fear with my whiskers. Envy strikes me with its tail. Love speaks to me wholly, a word of fur. I will teach you to be as still as an egg, and to glide like a wind through the grass.",
    "Sometimes in life I wonder, what am I doing? I have the energy, but there’s a storm brewing. I’ve lost control of myself; I just turned away, and now I’m with someone else. The days are flying by, but I’ve so much to do. I’m looking at a face to lead me through. Time won’t wait, it goes marching on. Everything seems to be wrong. I just turned away, and everything’s gone.... Sometimes in life I can’t believe what I see. I pick up the pieces, but some are missing. I look for the answers, but I seem to be guessing. Sometimes in life you can’t find what you need. You’re so empty inside, but there’s nothing to fill you up. It’s hard to find the path when you’re not sure what’s right. Sometimes in life I feel I know my way. It’s just around the corner, I’ll get there someday. When it seems hopeless, faith carries me through to a safe place. Sometimes in life I feel better. But the rain still comes down and it gets worse. It’s still a way to go until I get there, then I must stay. Sometimes in life I want the truth. But it’s surrounded by lies, and they’re breaking through. The answers don’t match the questions I find. Uncertainty steals my peace of mind...",
    "She is not the end of my rainbow, she is the beginning; I am blinded by her colors; her red, crimson, blood-red lips, which promise me fire and burn me with the raging stream of the bloody river which she gives me in the eddies of her passion. Her cheeks are flushed with that same color, and above her violet eyes, her aureole shines and spreads its radiance, down into my soul, where our rainbow of yellow lives. Yellow is the color of joy; we are connected, shared, framed by her tresses of the same hue. Her orange, which is mellow, descends along the dotted line of her bared back, right down to her nipples, which are erect with desire and the color of orange. The blood in her veins is now violet and indigo, her blood, which flows beneath her skin, announcing the purple promises of her body, which is now high, forming a rainbow-shaped arc, which makes our colors merge, the semicircle reversing itself to let me into her deeper tones. Outside the trees are green, inside our rainbows sing, announcing another beginning. So I catch a rainbow every day, and marvel at it, lying on my bed of a thousand lilies.",
    "Slap, slap, trot, trot, slap, slap, along the lonely highway, a little hot and lots of strength within, it is no marathon. Those morning runs I used to make in the cool morning air, wearing only one shoe, some of the neighbors said I was a lunatic. One day it was thick fog. I couldn’t see the houses as I ran by, but my strength was soaring, I had gas in me. That evening’s barbeque with chili beans and Weihenstephaner had given me the ability to run in seventh gear (carbohydrates). But chili beans can explode and blind insects with their steam and sound like a thousand vans. Outside a house that was more stately than most, it was a thunderbolt and it scared the bejesus out of a handsome gnome, and there she was, a dingaling. “You think it makes you run sso much ssshorter and ssssafer?” “No,” I said, “it’s just fun and afterward I feel fresher.” She nodded as if thinking, and I gave her a little wink, as if I had an idea, and then it happened again. The place had been darkened and I blasted off with all my strength into the fog, and a crimson glow came over me, I could not stay any longer. I ran off with all the strength I could, my face crimson red, and left the words: “You doggie! I understsnd.”",
    "Imagine that I’m sitting here, hiding in the shadows, while you go chasing Beauty across the land and sea. Imagine that while bleak streets of brick and stone Vainly partake of heat, noise, and dust from morning to night, I escape from the dismal present and am left alone With a new and now enfranchised sense. I’m lifting on the wings of a rare poet’s song, I’m soaring in the sky as free as the wind. Who has a firm hold on things? Who wanders in the shadows? Who reclines in some darkly bright wood Between sleep and wakefulness, where pine needles Fill his couch with the soft brown drooping sprays of pine? Does he own the actual or do I, Who paint on the air more than his senses are receiving, See through closed eyes the shining pine tufts, Smell the strong resinous smell, see the sky quiver like a blue flame between the leaves, And open unseen gates with a golden key?",
    "... At the lonely spot of the leaves, where they hung from the eaves, a bright, gay song-bird shot into the air, and the baby in the bed, his head lifted, his eyes wide open, woke his mother, and made her watch the bird; she kissed his sweet chin, the red soles of his feet, his wild-haired hands, which patted hers like wind-blown flowers; he twisted her blond hair around his neck as white as milk: “What does that birdie sing on its green sprig yonder?” “That’s a whole lot of songs,” said the baby. “Papa is coming home with the drums today, he says. Here’s your cup, birdie, you can drink all the milk; I’ll kiss you, birdie, you’re washed clean and pretty.” She got up, her eyes looked to the heavens, she sent her stout dove soul up through the light; she kissed her hand, and on it the golden band that bound the splendid scroll of her life and closed her simple story.",
    "It is also an image, in which the way things are is drawn, a door, a crown, a shield, a scuff mark. And those who know you, or know their own sense of themselves, know where you are. There is a moment between utterances, when the present moment offers nothing; and one's thoughts withdraw from the present; one enters into a peaceful, orderly room; in it the shelves are set out by an unknown librarian, who knows you better than you know yourself. I sit quietly in that green-leather chair; but such is the power of the memory of you, of the pure memory of memory itself, that I need not pull down the well-thumbed book, but simply look toward the shelf, and where it rests; I sit for a moment, eternal; find myself; and then I get up, I walk, my back straight, my head up, my head high, my bearing fuller from the memory of who I am; turn the smooth handle of the door as it shuts, and then, outside of all love, comes the long-lost freedom of the watcher.",
    "January is jumping around in the frying pan, trying to warm his frozen feet, like a Canadian. February crawls under the lid of any pot or pan, and believes she is dry, for she is completely hidden, but it rains all the month, and has always rained all the month. March is in the bathtub with the taps running. A good wash and a good rinse, more, more, more. April scurries about, sometimes inside, sometimes outside, escaping a shower of bright rain in an empty milk bottle, and then rushing out again. May is nowhere to be found, not even in hiding. It is always walking along the wall, proud as a peacock. May, oh May, so leafy and flowery! June takes off its clothes by the stream, and dips into a bucket of cream for the first time this year. July sits on the beach letting the sand run from its not-quite-so-stiff hand. Sometimes she thinks sad thoughts: “As I sit here, ah, I’ve lost more than half the year, a year that slips away.” August is the great August, once given a name by a king. It is golden and purple like a triumphal arch. (I know it rather cold and wet, though.) September lies in the shadow of the dying summer, hearing in the distance the silver trumpet of winter, and not very far off, the drummers of autumn. October is apples on the tree, partridge in the wood, big wind on the sea, mud starting in the lane, bright red berries, the big tree shaking its head furiously. November is when the fires are in the air, the shivering leaves and the mourning tree. November, November, a star shining with many things that were, but few things that are. A few weeks from now we’ll hear the silver bells of the sleigh of the stag and the hark of the sleigh bells flying in from the tundras and bringing us the gift of Christmas Day. December, last and twelfth.",
    "One of my favourite poems.... The sea is calm tonight. The tide is full, the moon lies brightly over the strait. On the French coast the light flickers and disappears; on the English coast the cliffs sparkle and stand, glittering, remote, in the tranquil bay. Come to the window, the night air is delicious. Only, from the long line of spray where the sea meets the moon-white land, you can hear the ringing noise of the pebbles that the waves draw back and throw, on their return, up the high shore, start, stop, and start again, trembling rhythmically, bringing in the eternal note of sadness. Sophocles heard it long ago in the Aegean, and it brought into his mind the muddy ebb and flow of human misery; we also find a thought in this sound, listening to it from this distant northern sea. The Sea of Faith was once full too, and around the earth’s shore lay like the folds of a wide, glowing belt. But now I can only hear its melancholy, long, retreating roar, retreating, to the roar of the night wind, along the endless, dreary edges, and bare shingles of the world. Oh, love, let us be true to each other! Because the world, which seems to lie before us like a land of dreams, so diverse, so beautiful, so new, has no joy, no love, no light, no certainty, no peace, no help for our sorrows; and we are here as on a plain of night, rife with confused alarms of flight and battle, where ignorant armies clash at night.",
    "Madame Doctor, Madame Brundrihg, take off your glasses, take off your wig. I am your entertainment. But frogs come from the sky like rain. They come like ugly, wild things. You are my judge. You are my jury. My faults are the things we're listing. I'll take a knife and cut up the frog. The frog has no nerves. The frog is old as a cockroach. The frog is my father's genital. The frog is a warped doorknob. The frog is a soft green bag. The moon does not want him. The sun wants to turn him off like a light bulb. At the sight of him, the stone washes in the washbasin. The crow thinks he's an apple, and drops a worm into him. The touch me nots are blown away by the frog like electric worms. The putty will have him. The putty has built him a house. Mr Poison is at my bed. He wants my wieners. He wants my bread. Madame Brundrihg, he wants my beer. He wants my Christ as a souvenir. The frog has a stye and a parasite in its throat. He says, kiss me, kiss me. And the ground is soaked. What an adorable princess who at that moment was walking in her garden, threw her golden ball up like a bubble and dropped it in the well! It was written. s the ills are given by the tarot. s the Supreme drills a hole in our heads and plays us the Boston symphony. But I'm getting out of hand. A loss has occurred. The ball is sinking like a cast-iron pot at the bottom of the well. Lost, she said, my moon, my butter cow, my yellow moth, my Indian rabbit. Obviously, it was more than a ball. Such balls are not sold at the Bon Marché. I had the moon, she said, between my teeth, and now it's gone and I'm lost forever. The thief robbed in the day. Suddenly the well is steaming and thick. A frog appears. The eyes are like two peas. The body is bound up. - Do not be afraid, princess, he said, I am not a beggar, a cattleman, a shepherd, a porter, a postman, a worker. I come to you as a merchant. I have something to sell. Your ball, he said, for only three things. Let me eat at your table. Let me drink at your cup. Let me sleep on your couch. The princess thought to herself: old toad, you will never do these three things, but she promised them, hoping to get her ball back. He took it in his mouth, like a cunning fox, and she ran back to the castle, leaving the frog alone. And in the evening, at dinner time, there was a knock at the castle door. A voice said: - Princess, let me in. You promised, let me in. I left the skunk cabbage to live with you. At that time the tenderhearted one had heard the promise and had to fulfill it. First, the frog sat on her lap. It was a coffin. Immediately he was at his plate, at his bacon and liver. - We will eat together, he said cheerfully. The fork trembled as if a little engine had been inserted. He sat on the liver and ate it like a professional. The princess was choking as if she were eating a puppy. He drank from her cup. That was not hygienic. He drank from the cup as if it were Socrates' hemlock. The bed came next. the king's silken bed. Ah! The seventh hour! - I was left in the river of the closed doors, he said, and I walked over the wet stones to live with you. She woke up with horror. - Frogs and birds I am sorry for, but not frogs, she said, and threw him into the corner of the room. Boom! A handsome prince rose up in the corner of the bedroom, like a genie from the samovar. And he was good-natured and gentle-looking, and his hands were sympathetic, and he was a friend to the unhappy. And so they were married. He had a princess encumbered. He had a night watchman and a fence around the room, and the well was closed so that she would not lose the ball again, the moon, the Krishna head, the blind poppy, the innocent globe, the Madonna bosom.",
    "Someone I don’t know stuffed my car’s exhaust with newspaper. I have no enemy; I’m a stranger in town, so why is some stranger trying to ruin me? My car was behaving oddly, and I rang the RACV, And what the mechanic found surprised me a great deal. A newspaper rolled up, jammed in the exhaust pipe, by someone who wasn’t nice at all. I’m not without sin; I cast no stone, But if you don’t like the look of me, leave my car alone. Against the person who did this, I couldn’t hold a grudge, And since I’m not a judge, Of that karma will surely take care What goes around comes around, that seems fair enough. A shallow-thinking person with low self-esteem, Could only do such a thing, it seems. And I would like to tell this person, don’t harm my old car. You shouldn’t hurt my car because you don’t like me.",
    "To find your true happiness, tempt fortune to discover your destiny. Remember the era when you experienced real happiness; opportunity knocks; open the door, you'll see it come. You may be surprised to find that fortune can conceal your fate. The fate and the destiny are not one. The fate is that which you have accepted in life, it is the daily pattern of life, a matter of life. The destiny is a gate at the end of the road, which opens to love and happiness. Is it really peaceful in the mind? At the end of life, the fate may leave you at the gate of destiny; you know only the suffering of the fight for life, but you do not know the joy of the victory. The gate may not open; you may feel lonely and sad at the end of life. The path of destiny is yours, yours and yours alone; do you want to be satisfied with the fate, or... do you want to tempt your fate and find the path? The dark side of life is that fear and uncertainty will obscure the path. Whether it is in your memories or in the situation in front of you, the path is always there.

    "Why did I come to see you last night? Perhaps being alone and bored at home forced me to come and see you. Or maybe I needed an excuse for a meal, Because every good action needs a beer or two I was ready to leave, But suddenly, \"We have beer upstairs. \" I couldn't say, \"Work and think about it\" Because her boyfriend was pushing her to go to the bathroom. You're too old to fight, And yet you fight, Thank God for that boy. Why did I dance on the counter? Probably because it's more difficult to win the pink than to be a fool. I don't know, but the precaution was necessary to celebrate. Why did I kiss the town? It's like a kid, You don't know that, But the other one is twice your age. But it's better to be like a model with every coming drink, than to be like a bull. Why did I stay at his house? It's like you fell asleep in the evening, The children play with their mother, one is already in high school, The other is in college, Learning about the knowledge While Mom is sitting on you. I've already said it, I'll say it again, Don't make a mistake, stay out late, and fight, And if it doesn't work, let's fake it for today.  by David Desantis 1994",
    "With a smile on their faces, they go and meet With the business of the country in a way, thousands of hours are wasted in procrastination The emergence of the rioting scene usually takes place One in a million chances succeeds to achieve a goal The whole country is in the grip of caste and religion No one has spared the Indian soil from the greed of the world. Who is still keeping the world? The people are very displeased with such a liberal democracy; it has established the supremacy of the people in every respect; Everything is done with the pretext of people's benefit; On the contrary, the interests of the people are overlooked, and their interests are being compromised. The judicial system has become inaccessible, and has failed, Some selected cases are getting public notice; It is very sad to see such a poor show in the world's biggest democracy, where you have not only promised but also imposed on the people; The people have a right to know what is going on in the sacred land. Each party is busy in its own interest. It is not a matter of concern to the national interest, but a necessity for its survival. All priorities of the country are a mess. We really hope that the country will survive in this situation. There are many good steps to be taken and revived. The country should protect the poor and their interests.

    "I am a poet of the Hudson River and the heights above it, the lights, the stars, the bridges. I am also, by my own self-appointment, a poet of the Atlantic, of the hearts of peoples as they pass it in steerage, strange and foreign, to the land of the new America. And so I must map out the realm of emotions. For I am a poet of the kindergarten (in the city) and of the cemetery (in the city) and of rapture and ragtime, and also of the secret city of the heart and mind. My song is the song of the natural person, in the twentieth century. It is true, but only partially, that a city is a “tyranny of numbers.” (This is the refrain of the metaphysical, urban, metropolitan self, after the two world wars of this century.) The city person gazes from window to window at night, when checkerboards of dim yellow light shine on tombs and on countless mortal frames, like the boards and slabs of the old graveyards, in which many lives are buried. The city person sees and says: “More, more, more, always more.”",
    "I wish my parents wouldn't fight; I feel like a cat in a corner that no one notices. They act like robots who have lost control of their motors, bumping, moving like clumsy cars, not like parents. They sound like gruesome black crows, if it weren't so serious. I am afraid that when my parents fight, they will divorce, or go their separate ways, and leave me. When I argue with my sister, it's usually because she's playing cards, but when my parents argue, it's like a knotted string, a winding yarn, I can't figure out the beginning. I want to help, but my words get tangled and don't come out. I want to be a bear for a while, go to sleep in a hole and hibernate forever, or run away, but I usually go to bed with my clothes on and lie awake. Maybe they won't separate, but I can't be sure, can I? It's just like an earthquake. This is a possibility I don't like. It's like something bad is always chasing me, and it's like I have a sign on my back that says \"My parents fight\", and everyone looks at me.",
    "And a stork came one day to a city with an infant behind its wing, and it brought one to the house of a rich man, and one to the house of a peasant; he said to the rich man: \"My son shall be the king of the land and seas,\" but the poor man said: \"God has sent me to feed another mouth to bite.\" The rich man's son grew up to be strong and handsome, and he lived by the rule of a millionaire, and he crowded years in one day. He bought his position, his fame, his house; he bought his wife a fine-looking face; he traveled the world, but in his heart was discontent, like a snake hiding in the leaves; and life was as hollow as a gold elixir; he despised woman and doubted God, and he died like a beast and went back to the earth. The peasant's son plowed the earth, he thanked God for his health and labor; he married young and mingled two lives, in tune and time. His needs were simple, and his faith was simple: it was to trust God in everything; it met his need, and it helped him to work, and helped him to die with a smile on his lips and a hope in his eyes. So who was the richest of these two?",

    "However, what if the Greeks were right? If, although some of us may want to climb up Mount Olympus (a rocky climb is exhilarating in the fresh, wet morning, and the smell of coffee, of baked bread rises from the valley below, the shrill call of a shepherd higher up, the shrill bleat of a goat, and finally the fog and the thinning air and the growing humility and surrender of the heart)—if we all, all of us, perhaps to varying degrees, aspire to the True, the Good and the Beautiful (perhaps not in that order, or at least at first, and believing or not believing that we shall know the moment when in their splendor all three will fuse, and become indistinguishable... for this, no ascent is necessary, since the gods, as the Greeks believed, dwell eternally in our hearts; they rest there and wait for our summons to show us ourselves to ourselves, and then burst out into the enthusiastic explosion of what we know as enthusiasm.) But those who love climbing, those who love the mountain air, the high vistas, the dangers, the thrill of sport and the risk of risk – the summit summits attained, the sandstone no longer playing its snakes and ladders with our feet and hearts and minds, the clouds lying over us like white, shrouding mysteries; the gods, who could not be seen from the earth, hastens to greet us in our hearts; for those who have not yet reached the top, the last boulder stepped over, the sand no longer playing its snakes and ladders game with our feet and hearts and minds; the clouds below like a white veil hiding mysteries, the gods briskly greet us in our hearts; we, pure oxygen for those still visible through the poetic cloud-breaks, rising on their way; we, pure oxygen for them, climbing up on their way, breathing pure oxygen to them, saying to them: yes, the climb is worth it, the Greeks were right.",

    "Overwhelming sorrow now calls me to song. Out of death the sorrowful feeling springs. What flowing tears, what hearts rent with grief? What sobbing from loving parents’ breasts? The brother weeps, the hapless sisters join him; Their increasing grief makes the crystal salt. The poor, once fed by his kind bounty, are sunk and mourn his death. The death of the friend, the kind companion lies in death. And in one death all comforts are dying. The unhappy mother sees the rill of blood stop flowing, and the wheels of nature are broken. But see his soul, far from earth, no longer near. His spirit, flying faster than the wind, has left behind the world of death for glories unknown to the earthly state. The reward of virtue, the prize is a reward. The wonders of this wondrous prize to behold! But of celestial joys I sing in vain. Don’t make me sing the too adventitious strain. No more in briny showers, you friends around him, No more to bathe his earth, or bury it in the ground. But still you weep, you still wish for his return! How cruel to long for his return and to be sad! No more for him your flowing tears! But join him on the celestial shore! And tune your harps with immortal songs! Raise immortal anthems to your God.",
    "She was to be in Washington at the Inauguration, a fifteen-year-old girl, to march with the band of the King College Prep High School, to see history made again by President Barrack Obama, and to hear loud weeping of parents just as they did at Sandy Hook, And then the early school dismissal, all seemed well. Finished with her exams, under an umbrella, avoiding the rain, Then at two-thirty in the afternoon, under the open sky, Under a few dozen others, then the shots rang out. A lone gunman jumped a fence and opened fire at the crowd, And like Sandy Hook, parents were weeping aloud. Two more bullets were fired, probably by rival gang members, but both times the intended victims only suffered injury. And so it went, With a gun, the gang member, regardless of whether his target was right or wrong, Must have been uncaring, with his dead eye, without regard for life, It mattered little whether he missed, Some in the crowd were her fellow students, members of the school's band, The shooting panicked everyone out of the park, And so it went, a child in the wrong, her hopes and dreams shattered, First the Capitol, and next a trip with classmates to Paris, France. In Chicago, last year, there were more than 500 homicides, but only 42 murders up to the end of January, In addition, in the gangs there were more than a hundred shootings. Statistics are often misleading, so it's hard to be precise, But this much is clear: if we continue to release convicted murderers, this is the sort of society we're in. The president's spokesman, Jay Carney, said: “Our prayers are with the family, it's a terrible tragedy,” Here is another idea: \"Put a stop to it,\" the president should get to work with Congress to find a solution, Germany takes six months to issue a driver's license, Imagine if the time taken to issue a gun permit were six months, How many more would still be alive?

    "It was as if God had wanted him to go to places of pilgrimage. The prince then went out from the South Gate. He asked his charioteer, “Why is this man suffering?” “He’s sick, and suffering from a disease,” the charioteer said. “But why is he suffering? How did he fall ill?” asked the prince. The charioteer explained: “Anyone, young or old, rich or poor, wise or foolish, can fall ill.” Siddhartha then felt: “If there is the possibility of this suffering, it ends in suffering, then pleasure has no meaning.” They returned to the palace. The prince’s mind became restless. Then he went out again, this time from the West Gate. A little beyond the palace a crowd was slowly moving. Four men were carrying a corpse on their shoulders; others followed them, crying. It was the prince’s third experience. This time the charioteer explained briefly: “Death follows every birth.” “So the whole world is an illusion,” said the prince. “For what we do not see is real, and what we do see is unreal.” He was saddened.",

Then the eggs may be used in various dishes. They are delicious in the soup for yakisoba, in which they are used as a condiment. Quail eggs in Chinese rice are a delight.",

The honey is to be added to taste. If you can’t find almond flour, make it yourself. Put the almonds in a food processor or a nut grinder and process until fine. Almonds will be more easily ground in a nut grinder. Add a couple of tablespoons of sugar to prevent the almonds from turning into nut butter. Put a cake pan in the oven and preheat to 200°F. First make the orange syrup. The orange juice, 2 tablespoons of the honey (if you want to), and the cardamom go into a small saucepan and simmer over medium heat until it’s reduced to about a quarter cup (use a glass measuring cup to make sure). Set aside. Cut the rind and pith from the oranges and slice the oranges in rounds about 38-inch thick. Put the oranges in a heatproof bowl and pour the syrup over them when it’s cooled a bit. Set aside. Put the cream and 1 tablespoon of the honey (if you want to) in a large bowl and beat to soft peaks. Keep in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve the pancakes. First make the pancakes. Put the eggs, cream cheese, almond flour, sour cream, milk, almond extract, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, and the remaining 2 tablespoons honey (if you want to) in a blender and blend on high speed until smooth and completely blended, about 1 minute. Then pour the batter into a non-stick 6-inch frying pan and bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes. You can melt about 12 tablespoon of ghee or lard and pour about 14 cup of the batter into the pan. I pour straight from the blender. You should pour enough to make a 5-inch-thick pancake. Cook until bubbles pop up around the edges and the bottom is golden brown, about 45 seconds. Turn and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 45 seconds. Pancakes go on the cake pan and the oven will keep them warm. Wipe the pan clean with a paper towel and continue with the remaining batter.",
    "From the special recipes in the Food & Wine Annual: Preheat the oven to 325° F. Put the rack at the lower shelf. In a large bowl, using an electric hand-held mixer, beat the egg whites until sour, 3 minutes. Add the cream of tartar and beat until stiff, 3 minutes more. Then sift the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into a bowl. In another bowl, stir the egg yolks, oil, lemon juice, zest, and 14 cup water. Fold the egg yolk mixture into the flour mixture. Toss in 1/3 of the beaten egg whites, then fold in the remaining whites. Pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake until a cake pick comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Turn the cake out of the pan and cool. Then make the icing: In a small saucepan, bring the sugar and the remaining 2 cup water to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Then beat in the cream of tartar. Then beat in the hot sugar syrup. Beat in the vanilla, and then beat until cool. Pass a thin, sharp knife around the outside and inside of the cake to loosen it. Transfer the cake to a platter. Ice and serve.",
    "Taking the flour for this bread, make sure it’s of a medium or short-grain rice, not long-grain rice. Prepare it 12 to 18 hours before baking. The first thing to do is to mix the rice flour and salt, and then make a well in the middle. Pour in the water, and stir from the centre of the well outwards, beating all the while with a wooden spoon, or at a moderate speed with an electric beater, and beat well. Leave it 12 to 18 hours at room temperature. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Add the honey, oil and yeast solution to the mixture, and beat thoroughly with a hand or an electric beater until the whole has become one even, smooth consistency. Then add the methocel, and beat thoroughly again. Using a spoon, fill three well greased 340-cup loaf tins with the dough, smoothing the surface with a wet finger or with oil. Leave the loaves in a warm, moist place to rise until the mixture has risen to the top of the tins. Watch the surface of the dough carefully, and be ready to put the loaves into the oven as soon as the first tiny pinholes appear. Bake at 180°C for about 45 minutes, or until done. When it’s risen, let it cool down well before cutting it. NB: If the mixture is too stiff, the surface will crack before it has had time to rise, and the bread will be tough. If it’s too wet, it will rise up into a large arch, like wheaten bread, but then it will fall down. Once you have done it a few times, you’ll soon feel how the consistency should be. Don’t use butter or lard in this recipe, as they make the methocel work incorrectly. Put the bread in a plastic bag in the bottom of the cold compartment of the refrigerator, and freeze any surplus loaves, as the bread ages very quickly.",
    "These are simple recipes and don’t need special equipment. First of all, make the butter. Using the recipe for Candied Almonds below, roast the pears for a couple of hours until they’re tender but still hold their shape. Preheat the oven to 300°. Toss the almonds in a food processor and pulse them a few times to chop them coarsely. Scatter them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake them until they’re golden and fragrant, about 10 minutes. In a saucepan, heat the cream with the sugar. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod into the cream; add the pod as well for extra flavor. Stir the sugar into the cream and heat the cream to the boiling point, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Stir in the almonds and salt, cover the pan and set aside for 30 minutes. Pour the almond mixture through a fine-meshed sieve and press it with the back of a wooden spoon to extract all the flavor from the solids. Then discard the solids. Let the gelatin soften in cold water for 3 minutes; squeeze it dry. Stir the softened gelatin into the almond mixture while it’s still warm. Then stir in the buttermilk. Pour about half the almond cream into 6 straight-sided glasses. Pour carefully, so that the liquid doesn’t run down the sides of the glasses. Cover each glass with a layer of the remaining almond cream and refrigerate until the cream is set, at least 8 hours or, even better, overnight. Serve with a couple of pears arranged on top of each of the creams and garnish with the candied almonds. Preheat the oven to 400°. Spray a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Peel the pears, cut them in half, remove the cores and cut each half into 6 wedges. Then place them on the baking sheet, so that the cut sides are down. In a bowl, stir together the molasses, sugar, rum, vanilla and salt. Then pour the mixture over the pears, toss them with tongs to coat and bake for 20 minutes, turning once, until they’re tender and golden brown. Take them out of the oven and let them cool until just warm. And put aside the pan of molasses syrup, which is terrific over ice cream.",

    "3. Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. Put some salt and lime juice on the surface of each half and then chop the first half into little pieces. You can do this with your fingers and then push the pieces into a bowl. Put the second half on top of it and then the third. This is a trick a friend from Costa Rica taught me and for some strange reason it makes the guacamole last longer. Then crush the pieces of avocado with a fork and stir in the rest of the ingredients. Be careful not to add too much Worcestershire sauce or Tabasco — only a few drops are needed. The quantities of lime and salt aren’t fixed. Add a little and then taste it and add more if you think it’s not quite right. Variations: I sometimes use salsa instead of fresh tomatoes or I chop up a tin of Rotel or something similar. I especially like the glass jar of Salsa Casera or a little tin of Embasa. You can add garlic or top it with grated Parmesan cheese. Please note: the quantities given here are approximate. You must use some common sense.",

    "You ever feel like you’re missing something? Like a secret others aren’t sharing with you? I’ve got a music criticism page and one of my friends started a YouTube channel a year after me, doing exactly the same thing. I try to sift through all the metrics from TubeBuddy and YouTube Studio to get a sense of my audience and to see how I can grow it. My friend just shoots a vid and puts it up. He doesn’t even do much editing and he’s usually shooting in 1080p whereas I shoot in 4K. I have 393 subscribers, and he has 1302. That doesn’t make any sense. I’m sure the YouTube formula helped him out a lot, but it just makes me feel like I’m missing something. I know it’s not true and that everyone has their own unique YouTube journey, but it still makes me feel discouraged. Not that I’m wallowing in self-pity, but it’s nice to get it off my chest.",
    "You see, a greatsword isn't something as easy as a \"Knock Knock\" sword, like a clumsy, simple-minded, tomboyish broadsword. A greatsword requires a certain level of intelligence. Because unlike other weapons, it is not necessary to learn monster patterns, nor does any other weapon reward a person who takes time to learn the timing when an enemy is most vulnerable to attack. In other words, the way to become a greatsword player is to possess a certain level of intelligence, because if you go into battle with a low IQ, or the kind of mentality you find in other weapons, you won't be able to even land a strong charge, much less a TCS. And even though I just said that crit-draw is for beta-version GS players, I'm still going to complain about how Ichinose made a complete downgrade to crit-draw in MhR. Because it was a unique greatsword ability that was demolished for no reason. The bottom line is: screw the low-IQ betas who wield the 2,900-point GS, and good riddance to the godlike greatsword.",
    "I've been playing for a few years and used Ludwig Breakbeats.

I wonder if my small recording room is to blame? Anyway, I'd like to hear what other people think. I'll keep trying different tunings on the Customs but am considering either a return to Breakbeats or perhaps an 18-inch kick drum.",
    "Can we all agree that huge maps, with only one point of interest, are bad. Their design is inept. With only one point of interest, if you don't get the good spawns, you're shit out of luck.

If shoreline ever gets a makeover, like customs, then at least add more than one point of interest, and future maps can put more focus on form than function. Maybe add beach huts and tourist areas, or since there's a power plant, then why not make a water treatment plant, with offices, a parking lot, and big silos.

If you are afraid of sharks, you can go to the shallows where the water is clear enough to see the bottom, but in lakes and rivers it is usually so cloudy, and you can’t tell what is there. However, I live in Australia, so all swimming in water is a little frightful.",

Men will denigrate and make fun, but why do women and girls put themselves through it? I’m not blaming women and girls, but almost all comments end up with the same comments from misogynistic people. The guys who post on the site get funny comments and are not greeted with boring, sexist insults. Especially when it’s a girl or a woman with a conventionally pretty face, the comments are so much more unpleasant.

The red sauce doesn’t contain Japanese peppers any more. The green sauce has no longer been made with mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot sauce. It wasn’t as hot as the red. I shook the bottle and tasted it again. I thought that my tolerance had increased, but then I took a bite of Hellfire’s Detroit Scorpion sauce and it burned. Perhaps this bottle is just not as hot as the others. I do know that GB is no longer making private reserve sauces. Maybe they are economizing on the ingredients.

    "I’m twenty-one. All my friends are my age or younger, and we’re all in our third year of college. They love to drink. I’ve cut down on drinking since I started this journal, and since then I’ve found that I don’t have much in common with them. I love my friends very much, but recently I’ve noticed that they turn down my invitations to do things that don’t involve going to a bar in the middle of the night. Even perfectly harmless, enjoyable things that most people would enjoy, they won’t touch. I can understand people who like to drink, but they seem to think that their purpose in life is to get drunk. When I talk to them sober—when we’re not drinking and partying—our conversations are lame. I don’t really know any new people, so I feel kind of lost. It’s as if I’d never met them before, and yet these are people I’ve known for two years or more. It’s really depressing. I work part-time on the weekends and I’ve had more fun with my co-workers than I have with my friends. It’s a shame that society expects college students to be wild, irresponsible, alcoholics. That’s how they justify their daily drinking, and they can’t have just a few drinks. They have to get drunk. I’d appreciate any advice you might have. I just had to get that off my chest.",

Now I'm in a new relationship and my current boyfriend is great. I have a place to open up and we discuss the problems and how they come up.

    "I have spent the past ten years coming to terms with the fact that I was brought up by a nanny. But what really made me come to terms with it was when, in a couples’ therapy session, the therapist asked me something about the way my husband and I had been relating to each other, and how we could communicate more effectively. I somehow managed to splutter that this was the way my mother had wanted me to behave. She asked me for an example. I sat there, unable to find the words. My mouth closed, my tongue refused to budge. My husband and the therapist waited patiently. I finally managed to come up with an example that wasn’t really so bad. They were horrified, and I burst into tears, for if what I had been through was “not so bad”, how bad were the things that really were “bad”? Even now, I can’t talk about the things that were really bad with my husband or the therapist. I just can’t. My brain won’t let me. Although I’ve known my husband for almost twenty-five years, and trust him implicitly, and know that I am safe, I still can’t talk. Is this what other people feel?",
    "So I've been learning about the basics of the foreign exchange market and when to make trades from IM academy. I've learned a lot about what trades I could make, with the hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. The instructor says that with just the indicators on the hourglass you can get 60-70 per cent winning trades. I've learned the system they use to know if a trade is good or not. The problem I have is that the instructors seem to repeat themselves over and over again and I don't think I'm learning anything new. They seem to try to say it's so easy when it's not. I follow the strategy exactly as they teach me, but I keep losing. I've paid a lot of money to learn this and it almost seems like a scam. I understand that the market can do what it does and you can't predict it correctly for each and every trade, but I've been taught everything I know and I still can't. I have good and bad days, but it's hard to know where to go and I feel helpless because the instructors are repeating themselves every time they're live.",
    "This title was the best I could think of, but this is... Odd. Basically, my Moonlander has been working fine for a while now, the LEDs indicating what I've set, no problems. But a few months after I got it, the LEDs started doing... Strange things. They seem to cycle through different backlighting settings every few times you power it up. Sometimes it's ripples of different colors, sometimes a solid color, sometimes a fading between two colors, and so on. I found that if you kept restarting it, it would eventually cycle back to the current setting, but then it'd keep going back and forth. Eventually it even started not turning on at all, which can get annoying. Has anyone else experienced this, or is my keyboard just completely insane?",
    "I was interested in playing a mask, so I decided to look up a guide for a role. But then I felt too limited, like all the characters of this type could only have this kind of personality. My initial idea was for a character who could turn his body into crystal. He was proud of his ability because it allowed him to protect those he cared about and of that nature he was more willing to help others with their problems than to solve his own. But if I used the guide, if I wanted to play a character like that, he had to be constantly crystal and had to be ashamed of his looks because he felt like a monster. Am I missing something? Is there some sort of deconstruction of the guides to come up with original characters?",
    "Japan's invasion and burning of Nanking in China in December, 1938 indirectly led to the birth of animation. If this had not happened, the United States would not have taxed Japanese oil, and the Japanese would not have attacked Pearl Harbor. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, America entered the war, and it was Einstein who taught America the atomic bomb. After winning the war, America set up its military bases in Tokyo and Japan. After returning to the United States, American soldiers left behind comic books in Japan. That's how the Japanese learned the art of comics, and later created the Japanese manga and animation. And in the eighties, American soldiers brought back the Japanese animation to the United States.",
    "This is really for future reference as I have a first-class medical, but now I only have third-class privileges because it’s been a year since I last got it, but I have a question. When I first got my license, I had to go through a deferral and go through the whole FAA and psychiatrist to get my license because when I was 13 I was on antidepressants for a month, but none the less I got it, and then it’s like there’s a little box that says something like ‘have you ever been treated for anxiety or depression’, and then I got it without any limitations or restrictions. And I’m wondering if I renew it, when I’m filling in the form, will I have to tick that box that says ‘have you ever been treated for anxiety or depression’, and will I be put through the same process, or can I tell the AME that I’ve already been deferred and it’s been resolved? I don’t remember ever receiving any instructions on how to renew my license.",
    "Question: Can I transfer money from my TFSA Direct Investing Account directly into a chequing account to use as a down payment on a house? Or do I need to transfer the money out of my TFSA into my chequing account first to be able to obtain a certified cheque from the bank? My worry about moving the money out of the TFSA into the chequing account now is that if I end up not going through with the deposit, I can’t put that money back into the TFSA until next year. I would therefore be missing the opportunity to reinvest the cash in the TFSA. Basically, I’m wondering if I can’t have the best of both worlds: keep the money in the TFSA so I can reinvest it later, and then if I decide to use it for a down payment, have the money available immediately. Can I just go to the bank and say: I need $ x now, it’s in my TFSA, cash it out now? Hope that makes sense. Thanks.",
    "I’ve always been considered too young or juvenile for my age, and so no one has ever taken me seriously or talked to me, even in high school or college. Not that I’m really that ugly, it’s just that I’m very young-looking. How can I get over my past experience of nobody wanting to talk to me and my social anxiety, and finally start going out to bars on my own and chatting with people? I’m just wasting my life away, stuck at this point. My therapists haven’t been able to make this change in me. Do I have to stop all medication and work on myself first? I started with the fact that I’m small in stature and look kind of scrawny, even though I’m a little overweight. What can I do to stop wasting my life away and be afraid of change? I can’t even leave a job when I don’t like it and it would be logical to do so because of the change, the disruption, and the trouble of moving and learning a new job all over again.",
    "Hello, I have a problem and maybe someone can give me some advice. At the beginning of December I bought something on Ebay via Shop&Ship. I was wary, because of the bad reviews on the Internet, but many on this subreddit had recommended it to me. My package arrived after a week at their address and after a few days my balance had not been credited. I was telling myself that because of the Christmas holidays, there was a lot of work, but after a week nothing. I decided to contact their customer service, they contacted me a few days later and asked for the transport code, invoice, proof of payment, etc. To my surprise, I got a call that they checked and that they did not find my package, so I had to ask the seller on Ebay for a proof of delivery or let Ebay look into it. I wanted to contact Ebay and ended up losing the lawsuit, because the seller had proof that my package had been delivered to the address. I tried to explain the situation, but nothing. I even talked to the boss and nothing. I called the customer protection and they told me they could not help me. The order was worth 499 dollars. In my last conversation with them, they told me that according to their policy, they were not responsible, but that they would look into it again and now it's been two months. Any advice is welcome, thanks a lot.",

Just because you're young and healthy, doesn't mean you can't get the coronavirus and die of it.

I have tried the trick of hiding everyone, but that doesn't seem to drop their strength either.

    "- Well, I've been thinking about how a possible remake of DDLC would look like. Normally, it's not a good idea to remake something that has such a close connection with the original as DDLC, but I have an idea that could work. The basic idea is that someone is going to download the game, and then something normal happens, but then the crew gets in touch with him and they find out that he has been a thief. Monika will then find a way to escape from the game into the real world. Maybe all the other dokis will follow her, I don't know. So the rest of the remake will be how the Dokis and the player react to this and so on. The basic concept is a bit like how the Sonic movie is about Sonic in the real world. Or at least that's what the promotion says. Actually, the twist is that the Dokis realize that they are not in the real world, but in the new media that is adapted to. And that's as far as I got. I don't really know how the rest of the movie will go, but I think it's a good twist that will surprise many. I also don't really know what media it should be adapted to. What do you think?",

    "For the sake of clarity, here is the situation: In my youth I was crazy about pork rinds, and would wolf them down whenever I got a chance. One day my father brought home a bag weighing about a kilogram of pork rind, and of course I couldn’t resist. I’d go off and have a couple of pieces and then come back to my room, whereupon I’d start again and wind up eating half the bag all by myself. To cut a long story short, I wound up in hospital with severe dehydration, kept there a week, after which, every time I ate or even thought about eating a pork rind, I’d get a jolt to my head. To make a long story short, after that, every time I ate or even thought about eating a pork rind, I’d get a jolt to my head. To this day, at my twenty-five, I still have to put up with this; it’s a very hard lot of work, because my liking for pork carries on unabated, but I’m not able to enjoy it the way I ought to because I’d get the headache straight away.",

I quit my job because I had panic attacks and suicidal thoughts all the time, and there are days when I just can’t get the energy to do more than get out of bed. I feel worse than I can remember. It is a big blow to me that even though I’m doing everything I can, or maybe precisely because I do, I feel so awful all the time, and I want to die every day.

    "There are those who would say it isn’t an egg at all. The popular opinion seems to be that the egg is an intelligent fungus, but I don’t think this is true. The thing is, unless BadBoyHalo is leading us on, the egg would have told us that it isn’t an egg. The thing is, BadBoyHalo refers to the egg as an egg. Now then, let’s turn to theories. There are those who would argue that the egg contains a human being. If this is the case, the person must be important if we are to be treated to an important event. I personally think it unlikely that a person is inside the egg. I think it’s more likely that Quackity is bringing him back to life. What I believe is that the true purpose of the egg is to hatch. Once the egg hatches, Karl will be covered with its spores. He will then gradually increase in strength and will attempt to take over the whole world. With the help of the other side of the egg, he will then be able to cross over to another part of the world. The egg BadBoyHalo discovered was sent here by Karl of the other world. I believe that BadBoyHalo is a kind of chosen one. Eventually, when the egg is successful, Bad will become the egg’s consciousness in the next time stream. Billiam is the equivalent of Bad. Perhaps the present-day egg has Sir Billiam’s consciousness. In the next time stream, the egg is trying to hide itself from its prey. What do you think?",
    "My best friend was always making comments about my mother’s ass, her teets, etc., he would always say he was the one who fucked her, and so on and so forth. But when I came home early from a game of basketball and saw my best friend’s car in the driveway, I decided it was time to end it. I went in and it was quiet, but my mother was home, she was home from her course. I went into her room to ask her why he was here, to see my childhood friend fucking my mother. She hurried to get dressed and that’s when I saw his dick. It was at least nine inches long, while mine is three. While my mother was hurrying to get dressed, he told her to stop and that he wanted to see what was in my pants. My mother didn’t say anything and neither did I, he grabbed me and put me against the wall and dropped my pants. He made my mother take a picture of our dicks next to each other, and then told me he wanted to keep on fucking my mother. I said no, and we argued until he grabbed me and tied me up with the sheets. I was forced to watch him fuck my mother. She enjoyed every minute of it. I was so surprised to see how much bigger his dick was than mine, it was even more surprising to see that it was on her picture next to his.",
    "Things like tablets, smart phones, touch screens, etc. That we use in everyday life today, but were considered brand-new and exciting technological wonders back then. I’m sure that no adult back then would have imagined that you’d give a 7-year-old a whole iPad or iPhone. Parents at that time gave kids aged 7-13 maybe an iPod touch, and it was not a daily occurrence to have children with their own iPads and smart phones like today. In all fairness, there weren’t many child-friendly apps or content for iOS and Android back then; there was no TikTok or Musical.ly, no Vine, and the social media platforms of today were still so dominated by adults and no influencer culture. It’s still strange though that as a tween I was frowned upon for wanting an iPad while my five-year-old nephew has one. This is probably something that’s only happened to me and other people born in my year; we weren’t given technology from the time we were born, and we weren’t ‘digitally nomads’ like the earliest or the most core millennials either.

I have been in and out of the hospital, because I have tried to kill myself. People tell me it will get better. People lure me over the edge. I feel old even though I'm a teenager. I keep looking back and thinking it was brighter then. People around me have tried to help me, but it made it worse. I feel I have no friends, but I know I have them, wonderful people who love me.

    "In April 2020 I applied for a small EIDL loan and used the short form, I think. I was guided by some videos on You-Tube. I received a grant of a thousand kroner and a loan of ten thousand kroner. Now, as I am waiting for a review of the targeted advanced grant, I see that I might have entered the wrong figures. I have closed down the old business and started a new one. Instead of changing the name, I started a new one. This was in September or October of this year. When I had made the transition, I probably had about two months of income reported in the turnover statement. In the PPP and all that I used the correct figures. I thought I had done the same in EIDL. Looking at the forms, I should have entered turnover from before January 1, and I suspect that I may have entered turnover for 2020, and that I therefore received a loan of ten thousand kroner. I am afraid I may be denied for the targeted grant, and that that may be one of the reasons why it is taking so long. The tax office has not yet dealt with my tax return for 2019. If I send in my tax return for 2020, will that help? Is it possible to correct it while it is being reviewed? Is it possible to get a copy of the application so that I can check?",

    "Then I'll tell you what it would be like if Tom Cruise stepped out of his usual role as a spy in the science fiction & Impossible films. It would be even more thrilling & entertaining. In this series, Tom becomes Barry Seal, the new Ethan Hunt and the CIA the agency that determines his fate. But the difference is that Barry Seal prefers to go with the flow & never gets involved in anything that seems out of his reach, something every one of us can relate to. He's just an ordinary guy who just happens to be a pilot & wants to earn a little extra money with every extra mile. So what's wrong with that? Well, there is nothing wrong as long as you do it for the right people and nothing more exciting and dangerous when those people happen to be the CIA. You will definitely enjoy watching Tom as Barry Seal, who uses the CIA to his advantage, when you think that the only intelligent people in the world are those in the CIA.",
    "Cecilia: As a girl from the Philippines, this movie touches me in a special way because my grandfather was killed by the Japanese during the war. I’ve been told that he was tied to a post and burned with kerosene. I am watching this film as a way of paying homage to him and to those who sacrificed themselves so selflessly to secure a future of freedom and humanity for all of us. It struck me, though, that the film didn’t give a true picture of what we as a people suffered during the war. It would have been more accurate to include other atrocities committed by the Japanese, such as throwing babies into the air and spearing them with bayonets, or raping women so that they would have breasts cut off, or the massacre of over a hundred thousand civilians during the battle to liberate Manila in February of 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful to the director, John Dahl, for shedding light on an aspect of our history that few people know about, especially our younger generation: the Bataan Death March.",
    "Is there any reason for me to read reviews of disaster films before I remember that most of the people who write them take themselves seriously as film critics? It’s a disaster movie. Yes, the science is terrible. Yes, the coincidences are improbable. If you watch these for deep, richly interwoven stories or for an Oscar-worthy performance by an actor, you’re watching for the wrong damn reason. This film depicts a future in which, because of rising global temperatures, a modern ice age has set in. It comes about by storms, hurricanes of gigantic proportions, which cause rapid freezing and bring with them a host of disasters, including blizzards, which drop so much snow that you can walk along the highway under the signs. It also tries to mix in some human elements that you can relate to, such as the struggle of a father who has to be away from home to try to get to know his son, a lonely boy with cancer and the deaths caused by the disaster. Do not watch for the science, although I feel that they got the cause of the ice age right. Do not watch for the plot. Watch it for the fun ride it takes you on.",
    "I attended a sneak preview expecting it to be one of those “how a shy high school kid gets over his shyness” stories, but this movie is much more than that. This is a story with mature and moving characters and themes. The screenwriter and director said it best in the Q & A after the movie when he said the movie is about the emotional aspects of life at this age without being sentimental. I liked these three young people, Charlie, Sam, and Patrick, and their story never felt corny or sappy, just real, affecting, and touching. Go see it.",
    "\"I thought this was the beginning of your story... We are so limited by time,\" said Doctor Banks in the first thirty seconds of the film. Little did I know at first that this was the theme of the whole film. At the heart of the film lies the question of the power of language and how much it has influenced our way of thinking, of seeing the world around us, etc. When the alien race arrives on earth, Doctor Banks must find out what language they use and how to communicate with them in order to understand why they are here. The further she goes, the more she learns, the more she discovers that they don't think like we do, that they don't communicate like we do, and that they are not bound by time like we are. From the moment her daughter speaks to her, to the very spelling of her daughter's name, this theme permeates the whole film, from her daughter's thoughts to the big revelation at the end. We see the beginning of the film and think it's the beginning of a story, like everyone does, but as we become more and more involved and learn what Doctor Banks learns, we are also freed from the limits of time. The question is, if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This film is more than just another alien invasion, a story we've seen a thousand times before; it's deeper than that, and we should appreciate it for what it is. The art of storytelling. Easily a 10/10.",
    "Tom Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock ‘n’ roll, when the wildest music still had about it a sort of innocence which was long since gone but still present. The year is 1964 and a little band from Erie, Pennsylvania, called the Oneders (pronounced ‘One-ders’) but which was destined to become the Oh-nee-ders will start its music career. The drummer, Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott), works in his father’s electrical appliances shop, but when the drummer breaks his arm just before the first gig, he is asked to step in and the rest, as they say, is history. A lively and entertaining film in which luck, talent and chance play a part, which shows the bright side of fame, the joy of hearing one’s own song on the radio and the glitzy distractions of being in the public eye. But Hanks also shows the dark side, the creative differences and in-fighting that at some point affects nearly all bands, the petty jealousies and conflicts that are bound to crop up, the rudeness and insensitivity of the record-company employees who don’t give a damn about the people who put money in their pockets as long as they sell records. He sugars over the dark side, which makes it easier to take the bad things that happen and lessens the effect of the story as it unfolds, but he succeeds in keeping it credible and the realism of the characters he has created, and he is faithful to the fact that this is the story he wanted to tell and he has stayed true to his own original vision. 'A Hard Day's Night' and ‘Almost Famous’ have more in common with ‘A Hard Day’s Night’ than with ‘Band on the Run’. All three films are fairly true to life, but the question is whether you should hint at the truth as Hanks does, or make it explicitly obvious as Almost Famous did. With this film Hanks proves that he is just as good behind the camera as he was in front of it, he knows exactly what he is doing and when, and succeeds in doing it. And he manages to get some excellent performances out of his actors, especially Liam, Johnathon Schaech as the singer-songwriter, Steve Zahn as the guitarist, and Liv Tyler as his girlfriend Faye Dolan, who is stung by the side effects of his sudden fame. Hanks himself gives a fine performance as Mr. White, an employee at one of the record companies. The supporting cast includes Ethan Embry as the bassist, Charlize Theron as Tina, Obba Babatunde as Lamarr, Giovanni Ribisi as Chad, Chris X (Sol), Bill Cobbs as Del Paxton, Peter Scolari as Tony, Kristin Wilson as Marguerite, Chris Isaak as Uncle Bob and Dan Koss as Mr. Koss. - All in all, it is a pleasant, harmless and endearing film, which, like many others, is a way of returning to a time that was at least simpler and less chaotic. The more time passes, the better the good old days become. In reality they were perhaps not so good, but Hanks maintains the illusion by giving us a picture of how we like to imagine it. He does it with a touch of humor, but still very nicely. This is not only a pleasant diversion, but also a good film that can be enjoyed again and again, because it takes you back to a place you’d like to be, a place where you have been, even if only in your own mind. That Hanks is able to take you back to that place so easily is not only a credit to his talent, but also a beautiful example of the magic of film.",
    "Ran is based on Shakespeare’s greatest play, King Lear, and stands amongst his other classics: Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Ran, The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and The Hidden Fortress. He is a master at filming a great battle scene; there is no other director in the world who can film such scenes as he can. This is the most expensive film that Akira Kurosawa has ever made; in fact, it was Japan’s most expensive film ever. Even at the age of 75, he proved that he was still the best of the best. It is about an old lord, the head of the Ichimonji clan, who wants to retire and hand over power to his eldest son, Taro, but he must first exile his youngest son, Saburo, who speaks the truth. Soon, the old lord has been driven out of his castle and goes mad when he finds out that one of his sons is trying to kill him. The three brothers, all sworn to a sword, now face each other on the plains of the Kii Peninsula. The whole of Ichimonji’s peaceful kingdom is no more. Akira Kurosawa has created a great epic with a wonderful story, believable characters and battle scenes which are real battle scenes. All those who took part in this film deserve a reward. The acting is really good and is very believable. Kurosawa is a genius.",
    "First, the downsides. There are parts that are a little too long; the movie is two hours long, and it felt that way at certain points. It's a bit silly, and I'm sure some people will roll their eyes, and there will be people who walk out of the movie saying \"that was a stupid movie\" (as so many did after seeing Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within). I'm sure many of those people will be saying that because of the violence and gore. Which brings me to the upsides. The movie has its moments of awe, tension, and sheer gore, especially during the climax, with nearly identical scenes from the game, and some even with similar monsters. If you've played the games, you'll be familiar with a lot of the scenes. For example, the camera turns at the same time and place as in the game. There are also lots of the sound effects and music from the games, and even monsters. The atmosphere of the games is preserved in the movie, and it will be difficult to stay on your feet during the entire film. The movie is definitely creepy, and even if you haven't played the games, you'll still be scared.",
    "I must say that I enjoyed the most at the movies this summer while watching American Pie, which is the funniest film I’ve seen since last summer’s There’s Something About Mary. It’s a true comedy from beginning to end. Is the best if you like slapstick, grotesque or sex comedy. A superb cast of likable young actors. I think that this year’s supernova is Chris Klein. He was phenomenal in Election and is even better here as a sportsman who tries to sweeten his roughness in order to score at the prom. I have a feeling that Klein will become the next big thing in Hollywood and I hope he gets to try out different roles (I can imagine him in an action movie). Jason Biggs also plays the sympathetic character of Jim, the guy who is least likely to lose his virginity, and his manoeuvres are really amusing, and he gets most of the laughs. Finally, a huge clap for Eugene Levy, who gets the biggest laughs as Jim’s father.",
    "Peter Jackson really did make a masterpiece when he created The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring and he doesn't disappoint us in the second part of the trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder like so many directors, but I think The Two Towers even reaches the same level as The fellowship of the ring and sometimes even surpasses it. This is the longest movie in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? This movie has so many things going on, like the amazing Battle of Helm's Deep. Frodo and Sam have to travel to Mount Doom to destroy the ring. The one who leads them on their way is Gollum, who looks so realistic and frightening that he doesn't feel artificial. Andy Serkis did a powerful job as Gollum and should have been nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor. The best part of the movie is the end. The end of the Battle of Helm's Deep is just fantastic and in the distance you see Gandalf the White coming towards you with an army to help you defeat the orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Ents attack Isengard, the destruction and battle are so big that you really have to see it to believe it. When it comes to grandeur and scale, Peter Jackson has really changed the meaning of the word epic, and he also has the small details right that really make this movie great. I can highly recommend this movie to anyone, but I can only recommend that you see the first movie so you can fully understand what's going on. 10 out of 10 points.",
    "The original but good idea of this romance, which is to say that the lovers are communicating spiritually because one of them is dead, had been produced by the director Steven Spielberg about eight months before Ghost was exhibited. Always, a film whose title was derived from the fact that the couple, one of whom is dead, and the other who is alive, had a high-class visual style and played with mystery; but it lacked the sensitivity to romance that characterizes the Ghost. The original idea came from the writing of the story of Chandler Sprague and David Bohm. The film Ghost, however, did what \"Always\" had tried to do and had not done. Thanks to the great acting trio of Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg, who, by playing together, recorded memorable moments in the Ghost. We still remember how Molly and Sam fell in love with their thoughts for a while, and what they taught us was: \"Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts.\" So they never lost their faith in their long-term love. These unforgettable scenes in the Ghost were made by conceptually arranging the cuts, which made the story seem more believable, but enhanced the devotion of the lovers. The scene where Sam's ghost came to life in Oda Mae's body and was relieved of his yearning for Molly by kissing her is an immortal instant of film. I fell in love with someone, and February 10, 2005, when we both watched the Ghost on TV, I had a sudden impression of hearing the scene that Sam's ghost kissed Molly in Oda Mae's body. I thought that I was searching for the person I was talking to on the phone with the tears that I was hearing. She was sobbing and saying: \"I never forget the first time you kissed me, and I don't need to be alive to remember it. \" The Ghost is a masterpiece of immortality in the romance of cinema. (Incidentally, MTV ranked it as the best kiss of the nineties a few years after it was released.) The scene where Oda Mae reassures Molly that Sam's ghost is around her, and the scene where Molly explains to the police that Oda Mae knows something that no one but Sam and she know, are even more fantastical.",
    "..... Amusement Park...... Disaster... of course I had to see it... The beginning is full of promise, and we are looking forward to the disaster, which finally comes. There are great action sequences, especially the glass ball with the chewable and soft children inside. Unfortunately, the final act is insufferable comedy. Bryce Dallas Howard is an insecure manager who initially clashes with the gentle and untiringly arrogant man. It is clear where the tension is going to go. In an attempt to humanize the park, two nephews (the boy and another kid) are thrown in, who serve as a gimmick. Then Vincent D'Onofrio appears as Hoskins, a villain representing the military-industrial complex, who is interested in weaponizing the velociraptors. He sneers and eats, and is so obviously evil that he has a goatee. D'Onofrio does his job well, but the devil's intention to which he is strapped makes no sense. I had no idea, because he let loose the raptors (nearly featherless dinos) on a crazy rampage on the poor tourists. Why? Because of the action! And it was even the most bizarrely prolonged death sequence that I've seen, which did not pay off anything, did not even return anything, but only was a happy massacre of a minor character. And it was the Itchy and Scratchy part. The final act: if you don't want to think, close your eyes and ears. The first film had proved that you can have a clever script and a lot of dinos in the same film, but with each new part the IQ of the series has been falling. The first one had chaos theory, amber, DNA extraction, and all sorts of nifty things. What does the third have? The usual intention of the devil, the worst of the worst in storytelling, and characters so stupid that they run away from the T-Rex in high heels. This series has had a lobotomy.",
    "It may be true that every person has his fifteen minutes, even if it's usually more like a minute and a half, but how far can one carry that minute-and-a-half into the adult world? How does a healthy memory become a compulsion, which finally blurs the line between reality and imagination? 'Fan', a film by Tony Scott, with Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes, is a disturbing and unnerving movie about what such a moment means for everyone involved directly or indirectly in it. It's about Gil Renard (De Niro), a San Francisco cutlery dealer and a fanatical Giants fan, who is particularly excited about the off-season signing of star centerfielder Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) and is sure that he will bring the team a pennant. Once a player himself, Renard, who had a hard time with his son, Richie (Andrew J. Ferchland), in little league, is now a divorced father of a little leaguer, Richie (Andrew J. Ferchland), with whom he has a difficult relationship, and who is constantly on the verge of being fired for his insufficient sales. A turbulent, restless man, he is at a turning point in his life and takes inspiration from the philosophy of the catcher he played with, Cooper (Charles Hallahan), who, he believes, was the best athlete he ever knew. As his life gets worse, his preoccupations and lack of perspective lead him to a point beyond which there is no return. Tony Scott's film is less about baseball than about how this game relates to life and the things that really matter. In the words of Rayburn, \"We're not curing cancer.\" To those to whom the game has been reduced to that minute and a half, which they still cling to, it is everything. It is precisely this unhealthy obsession with this comparatively insignificant moment that Scott examines, which subsequently distorts the individual's reality. What is scary is that a close look at Renard reveals much that will find many a connection in the spectator: anger, annoyance, perhaps the inability to let go of this minute and a half, when it is threatened to become more than a good memory, but a sickening connection to a different past that may have never existed in reality. The eternal seeking for self-esteem, who does not realize its elusiveness and does not want to accept it, it is like a true basis for a ballplayer who no longer plays, a fan of his team, who no longer plays. As Renard tells his son: Baseball is better than life, because it is fair, because hitting a sacrifice fly doesn't count against your average. , an ideal that has always eluded Renard, who has never been able to give himself up for the sake of the team. Certainly, he is the son of an agent, but it was he who, as he says to his son, never knew how to give himself up for the sake of the team. Robert De Niro is the explosive Renard. One may think that his performance recalls Travis Bickle or Max Cady, and indeed there are affinities; but each has a personality of its own, and when viewed side by side, the differences become more apparent. Bickle is a sociopathic killer, Cady is a calculating murderer, Renard is just a man who has never been able to take charge of his life, and who has let his obsessions lead him on his way. There is something of the time when a life is going on behind the screen, as if you were looking over someone's shoulder, and that you recognize a face. His Renard is so much like someone you could meet in everyday life that it's scary to see him. Wesley Snipes, as Rayburn, also gives a solid performance, one of his best, which is not surprising when you consider the talent of the actor with whom he was working. De Niro's films, you may find a common thread between them and his co-actors. De Niro has a way of improving those who work with him, and this is something that remains forever. Think of Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep before The Deer Hunter, or Ed Harris before The Fog. Well, of course, they were already prestigious artists, but they are arguably better than they were before. And Wesley Snipes is not an exception to the rule, nor is Benicio Del Toro, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film The Trace, and who is memorable here as Rayburn's rival, Juan Primo. Then there is Patti d'Arbanville (Ellen), Ellen Barkin (Jewel), John Leguizamo (Manny), Chris Mulkey (Tim), Dan Butler (Garrity) and Brandon Hammond (Sean). A brainy thriller, very revealing on the mentality of the human being, The Fan is an open wound that may be too much for some people. To dismiss it as a mere \"baseball\" or \"action\" movie would be a mistake, for there is much more than meets the eye. I gave him nine out of ten. I rate him as a movie.",
    "The review gives everything away, so go and see the film first. It is neither allegory nor satire, the two best genres in both novels and films, yet it approaches perfection. It is something else I can’t put my finger on, but it’s a something that unveils the truth and pulverizes falsehood. Nothing is more slanted with falsehood than the victor’s account of past wars. We are especially the children of the victors – especially the children of American World War II veterans like myself. Our image of war is formed by films like Audie Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan: applause for the heroes and cheers for the enemy’s dead. But QT destroys this hypocrisy with a film where you first feel repelled by the enemy’s atrocities, then disgusted by the hero’s atrocities. That is the first moment. But the hypocrisy is pulverized in the second moment when we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American shot down by the German sniper hero, then we cheer the slaughter of a few hundred enemy by our hero. Tit for tat. This is why so many people dislike the film, without realizing it. High art, true art, a ten out of ten.",

    "Gladiator is a historical drama by the hands of Ridley Scott. Traitor to the new Caesar, the Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator, rises to acclaim as the people's champion, and finally gets the opportunity to avenge himself. The gladiator fights are especially vivid and exciting, and there are different styles of combat. The costumes and scenery are magnificent, and you can see Rome clearly. Hans Zimmer's music perfectly fits the mood. Gladiator is exciting and action-packed, and the story is very moving. \"Are you not entertained?\"",
    "The sixth sense loves to play with our imaginations. What the eyes behold is not quite what there is. What the mind portrays is not quite what there is. In the world of the sixth sense, logic is the enemy. You see the obvious and the not so obvious, but you don’t see them because of your mental reservation. There is a novel I read called ‘Made in France, the Next Day’ which is like this film but in writing. If you are like me who like to be surprised by something intellectual, you must read it. It is too risky to spoil the film by saying anything about it. I would only say that the ending is simply marvelous. I don’t find this film to be terribly philosophical or intellectual, but it is one of those I like to watch over and over again.",
    "The \"Transporter\" is a good film for what it is, a slick, smooth, high-speed action film that in no way asks us to believe anything and, above all, doesn't care. The directors have probably the best interest in mind in this case, since it allows them to devise various action and stunt scenes without having to bother at all about this pesky constraint of fantasy, called \"believability. \" Jason Statham has a lot of swagger in the role of \"The Transporter,\" a former military who delivers various packages without asking questions, not even in a little he doesn't ask any questions, all over the French Mediterranean Sea, to, of course, pretty nasty criminals. He then gets a package in the form of a young Chinese woman, Lai Kwan, tied up and bluffed, and loaded into the trunk of the car he loves and on which he pours all the love and affection he has. Frank, despite his first selfish and ruthless indifference, proves to be a very nice and helpful criminal and helps Lai defeat his villainous father's plan to sell a crate of Chinese people as slaves. However, the storyline is the least of the matter when it comes to a film like \"The Transporter\". Basically, it's just a story to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fights that have become the staple of action films. It's well directed, well shot and well-edited. Pierre Morel, the cinematographer, gives the Mediterranean sea, the French Riviera, a sparkling, almost sparkling color, and François Berleand is wonderful as a sly and wise policeman who suspects Frank of something, but who trusts his instinct enough to give him at least the benefit of the doubt. Energetic and charming, she plays the role of a 'complication' in Frank's well-organized and neat life. \"The Transporter\" is the cinematic equivalent of junk food from a fast-food restaurant, with a slapdash nutritional value, but satisfying when you have no desire or time for something more demanding.",
    "\"Back to the Future Part II\" is a worthy sequel to the first, which itself is a masterpiece. It's a time travel comedy that's a part of the trilogy, which deals with the paradox of time travel. The film depicts the time-traveling DeLorean, which has gone into the future and back into the past. I loved the whole trilogy, which is my favorite trilogy. I grew up with these films. I first saw the first one on VHS when I was a kid and saw the sequels later on the small screen. I love this movie to death, and it's my third favorite in the trilogy. But please don't get me wrong. I loved \"Back to the Future Part III\" more than this one, and I consider the third one to be the most underrated film in the trilogy. This movie has a lot of humor and comedy. It's a great movie with great direction by Robert Zemeckis and great writing by Bob Gale. The story starts on October 21, 2015, which is an important date in this movie and the trilogy, which celebrates its 30th anniversary in the year 2015. The films were released in Blu-ray. The plot continues with the Doc, Marty and Jennifer flying to the year 2015 to change the fate of Marty and his future family and save his son from being imprisoned. Then his archenemy Biff Tannen steals the Doc's idea and takes the DeLorean and a sports almanac, and Biff goes back to the past on November 12, 1955, to change the paradox, which Biff creates in the year 1985. It's the same alternate time line and the paradox that was also used in the season three opener of \"The Flash,\" \"Flashpoint. \" So the plot has Marty and the Doc chasing Biff for the almanac in the year 1955, where Biff is a teenager. The chase and the car chase scene, in which Marty drives Biff's car to get the almanac back and Biff crashes into a manure truck, is my favorite scene in the movie. It's a very funny scene, which also includes the scene in the future in which Marty chases Biff and his gang in the year 2015 and outwits them, which ends up with the gang landing on a courthouse roof. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic in their roles. Curtis Armstrong is great as well. I also loved Christopher Lloyd in the role of the Elder. There were a few things that I didn't like, and that's why I'm giving this movie a lower rating: I didn't like the dark future that was created. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's Biff character because he was such an annoying jerk. I also didn't like the death of George's father, George Sr. Then Biff marries Lorraine. I didn't like that the movie focused more on Biff than the Doc and Marty. There was a scene where they copy the first movie. I hated Biff Tannen in this movie so much. I didn't like the ending, where the Doc is hit by lightning with the DeLorean and sent back to the year 1885. Neither did the movie end with the satisfying happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like the way the movie portrayed older Marty. He acted so stupid in the movie, and that's why I like \"Back to the Future III\" more than this one. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover are not in the movie. Neither is Christopher Lloyd. I'm surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accepted the role of Lorraine but she declined to be in \"The Karate Kid II.\" That's weird. \"Back to the Future\" is my favorite trilogy of all time, and I love this movie to death. I hope they never make a \"Back to the Future IV\" because it would be a disaster. This movie gets 8 out of 10 stars. It's rated PG-13 for profanity, some sexual content and action. I miss movies like this one. They don't make 'em like this anymore.",
    "“*** SPOILER ALERT *** It made me embarrassed as an American to see this film, just knowing it would be seen abroad. It’s truly amazing how one sub can survive forty depth charges, while another can be sunk by two.” And, I believe it’s highly improbable that the Americans could stow away on a German sub, and vice versa. But the worst thing about this movie is its arrogant revision of history: it was the British who first solved the Enigma, not the Americans. Americans have no right to take credit for what others have done.” The movie just displays how ignorant Hollywood is about world history. But apart from that, it’s just a really dreadful film. No one with a brain in his head would be entertained by this trash.”",
    "Back in the day, there was a big science-fi section in the bookshops; but if you think that science-fi films are filled with great, thought-provoking ideas, the truth is that they are full of alien invasions, space battles and pulp adventure, then Moon is an oddity. The film is about Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only inhabitant of an isolated lunar mining station, and as his three-year contract is coming to an end, he wants to go home to see his wife. But his last weeks and days are going badly, and the events that unfold around him are confusing both for Sam and the audience, who cannot tell whether what is happening on the screen is happening in the real world or whether they are playing out in his mind. The film is however a thoughtful, thought-provoking story that touches on such topics as scientific ethics, corporatization, human identity and compassion. There are no aliens, lasers, wormholes, warp engines or spaceships here, just a lonely space-age concierge and a silent, monotonous robot and a lot of food for thought. This is science fiction as it should be.",
    "Beyond its edifying subject, \"The Judgment at Nuremburg\" revolutionizes the criminal drama. The camera swerves and swerves and skims between the lines of the magnificent Abby Mann script, and Stanly Kramer conducts his orchestra of renowned stars with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. The language problems and the complications of the setting are masterfully overcome. Spencer Tracy is absolutely superb, and we believe every word he says. His presiding judge is a monument of American humanity. Schell, the 29-year-old German, won the best-actor Academy Award, and his ardent performance has withstood the test of time. Montgomery Cliff makes his brief screen appearance one of those unforgettable moments that will never be forgotten by anyone who sees it. The man and his character are so closely identified that they fuse into a chilling and heart-rending truth. Marlene Dietrich, as a German aristocrat, lends a legendary aura to her screen personality. Judy Garland, over-fat and almost unrecognizable, breaks your heart and earns her last Academy Award nomination. My only annoyances were with the stern Burt Lancaster because I could not get over the fact that it was Burt Lancaster, and with the excitable Richard Widmark as the prosecutor. I have seen \"The Judgment at Nuremburg\" more than a dozen times, and I am still amazed that, despite its somber theme, the film always has enough stimulation and excitement to be a winner.",
    "This is a very powerful and important film. The story tells how the Scottish peasant William Wallace, when his wife is murdered, is pushed into a revolt against the English tyranny. With Mel Gibson, Patrick M’Goohan, Sophie Marceau and Brendan Gleeson, it has a good cast and all of them produce outstanding performances. The battles are very brutal and bloody, which adds to the film’s authenticity. The composer James Horner’s music is magnificent and powerful. It is a truly brave film, a film that demonstrates the valor and the horror of war.",
    "A great many people were disappointed with “Jackie Brown” when it came out because it failed to live up to the expectations created by the more outlandish “Reservoir Dogs” and “Pulp Fiction.” I must admit that I was one of these disenchanted spectators. But with the years I have come to appreciate this film more and more, and if you look at it for what it is and not what you expected it to be, you will find it is an underrated gem. The plot of “Jackie Brown” is much more character driven and its pacing is more leisurely than in the other two films. I have not read the Elmore Leonard novel on which it was based, so I cannot tell if this was intentional or due to the source material, but it may be a problem for people with a short attention span and a weakness for pop music. But fans of seventies crime films will find it quite easy to follow. The big names in the cast, De Niro, Fonda, and Jackson, are all very good, but the real standouts here are Pam Grier, the blaxploitation star of the seventies (Coffy, Foxy Brown, Black Mama, White Mama, etc.), and Robert Forster. Back in the day, he showed promise in “Medium Cool,” but was soon cast in a string of crappy B-movies such as “Vigilante” and “Alligator.” Forster’s role as Max Cherry is his best ever, and he is excellent in it. He is a wonderful character, but hardly an award-winner. I think the interesting thing about “Jackie Brown” is that Tarantino’s detractors accuse him of making shallow, violent, edgy crime movies, but the main storyline in this movie is about a middle-aged interracial romance, which is something I have never seen dealt with in a believable and realistic manner by any studio. It shows that Tarantino is a much deeper and bolder film-maker than some of his peers, and “Jackie Brown” is a fine film that deserves to be better known. Do not miss it, because it is not “Pulp Fiction: The Next Generation.”",
    "Over the Hedge was based on a comic book series, which, unbeknownst to me, I have never read. But I can only assume that it is just as good as the film, if not better. Although it is not a great surprise, I can say that Hedge is truly enjoyable and great fun for all. Bruce Willis plays R.J., a raccoon, who makes the mistake of his life by stealing the enormous stockpile of food that his neighbor Vincent (Nick Nolte) bears for winter hibernation. The bear is very angry about the raccoon’s rashness, but gives him one week to gather all the food he has stolen and everything else he needs, or else he’ll eat R.J. When R.J. starts looking for the food, he finds a new suburb that has all kinds of food, food and everything else. In the forest next door he finds a family of animals, whose head is turtle Verne (Garry Shandling). They all go looking for food too, and R.J., after teaching them a few things they didn’t know about the human world, sets off to get the food he needs. Of course, this is the main idea of the film, but as with all animated films, it has a few unexpected turns, and as with many animated films, it has a good lesson, and is great for both children and adults. The film is full of small children’s laughs, and then even more laughs for the adults. The heart of the film is about how a suburb is created and what it does to the environment, and how we abuse consumerism. Although it’s only partly satirical, it has many pop culture references and others. It was also luckily spared the mandatory song and dance that plagues most animated films. The story is well written, but it seems very rushed. It starts, it goes on a little, and then it ends. It’s not as short as some films, but you can’t help but wonder what else they could have done with a little more time. Having said that, it’s still much better than other Dreamworks productions, such as Madagascar and Shark Tale, and it can compete with Shrek 1 and 2 in the best. The voices are all of a very high quality, from Bruce Willis’ no-nonsense raccoon to the sadly deceased Garry Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carell also shines as the completely crazy squirrel Hammy, and William Shatner shines as opossum Oswald. I’d read in advance that he was great in the role of opossum. I didn’t stop laughing every time his character showed up, he’s that great. All the rest of the cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O’Hara as hedgehog parents, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as a pest exterminator, to Nick Nolte as bear Vincent, are also all good and suit their roles. They all have a lot of screen time, but none of them seem overly used (unlike Madagascar, where they were all overused with Ben Stiller). The insertion of Avril Lavigne as William Shatner’s daughter, Heather, was also a bit odd, but at least she at least tried to act in her role. And the animation is excellent as usual. It’s not as good as with other Dreamworks films, but it’s still a big step forward. The grass, the fur, the gestures and movements, everything is so perfect and beautiful to see. The colors are also beautiful. It’s a funny movie, and the cast is excellent. One of the best animated films in recent times. 8 out of 10.",
    "Everyone plays well, and the film would have been excellent if it hadn’t been for the intrusive narration, which gave the impression that it was being told to children, and which, when it came to saying that the two of them had gone to bed together, had the effect of a nursery rhyme. It was very strange. I also feel that if it had been more conversation-based, the audience would have had a better sense of the characters. I watched it without any sub-titles, and found it easier to understand the relationship between Juan Antonio and his ex-wife (most of the conversation was in Spanish) than that between Vicky and Don; there needed to be something in their relationship that made it special. Anyway, Javier Bardem is wonderful as usual.",
    "The third film about the young wizard is the most controversial, because it is this one that split the fans of the Harry Potter novels into two factions: conservatives and innovators. One of these factions denounced the film’s director, Alfonso Cuarón, for altering the Harry Potter stories to suit his own taste. They took exception to the strange werewolf, all the jokes that the director had inserted between the lines, and in addition they bemoaned the disappearance of the mystical atmosphere. So it should be, because the films are different from the novels. The fault lies at the very beginning. When Chris Columbus directed the first two films, the debate over what kind of films about Harry Potter should be reopened. The public is now accustomed to the mood of the first two films, so most of the audience took Cuarón’s novelistic approach to the film version of the third novel as a personal affront. Now the producers have made another mistake by entrusting two more films (The Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince) to a new director, David Yates. This is an error that ought never to have been made. You have to preserve the diversity of director’s visions. Hogwarts is not the only place where you see it depicted in different ways in the films, and so is Hogsmeade. Everything is different in the novels, because everything is seen through the eyes of Harry Potter. But in the films, although it may be filtered through the director’s vision, the magic world must also be seen through the eyes of the young wizard. Alfonso Cuarón was still right with his original vision of the plot of The Prisoner of Azkaban. He made a delightful tragicomedy out of the young wizard’s growing-up. The whole film reminds me of the old Soviet films. For the very reason that you can take apart the whole film, the shots, the dialogue, the characters, the music, etc., etc. (Sirius Black) The third film, like the book, is dedicated to the vandals: James Potter (= Harry Potter), Peter Pettigrew, Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, a group of friends who were once friends... The film brutally shows how easy it is to lose friends and how hard it is to acquire new ones. It is worth praising the skill of Alfonso Cuarón, who with one brushstroke has sketched in the full range of characters of the magical world and their essences: the Minister for Magic dives into a puddle; the soothsayer with the glasses on her nose stumbles into a puddle; Remus Lupin, in his lesson, eats an apple; the portraits of Hogwarts castle sleep; Stan Shivell, despite all his bravado, carries a student’s trunk; Hagrid is hardly up to the job of carrying the trunks of the students; Stan, with his heroic words, is not much of a strain when it comes to lugging the trunks of his students; Remus Lupin, in his lesson, eats an apple; the Hogwarts portraits, it turns out, are fond of sleep as well; Stan Shivell, with his manly words, is not very strong when it comes to carrying the student’s trunks; Hagrid is not very good at wearing ties; Stan Shantipike, with his valour speeches, is not very strong when it comes to moving student trunks; Tom, the keeper at the Leaky Cauldron, has a dripping broom; Ernie, in glasses with a large glass, has to lead the Knights; and, finally, Sirius Black is now beginning to talk a morality... Meanwhile, if I am not mistaken, the two actors from the third film (the barmaid from the Leaky Cauldron and Aunt Marge) are already safely cast in his other production, “The Human One”, but that is another story. - “Potter, come here!” (Severus Snape, the Potion Master). In a word, long live Rowling and Cuarón!",
    "He gave the best performance of his career. This madly twisting and dazzlingly stylized tale of a deadly plague that had forced the human race underground and the man sent back in time to find out what it was about is an adventure of mind-boggling complexity and also shows us that a man who goes back in time can't change the past, that things that have happened cannot be changed and that it is impossible to prevent a catastrophe, the outbreak of the plague. At one point, in a mental asylum, Bruce Willis says, “It’s already happened,” and the film doesn’t go forward as you might think, trying to save the world, but is instead an exploration of the naive, individual conflict of the man trying to survive in a constantly demented mental state. It is a new and original idea, which works brilliantly because of a script that Peoples has written tautly and in which Gilliam puts his special stamp. The movie is completely non-linear, full of dream, memory, present, past, future, and a scene lifted from Vertigo, and all of this is able to wrap the viewer in a disturbing and demented cacophony of madness and futility. As far as mise-en-scène and effects are concerned, Gilliam is a master of it, rivaling Tim Burton and his strikingly depressing and dismal settings and visual effects. Often bathed in an uncanny, antiseptic white light, the settings contrast with the often demented characters. Brad Pitt steals most of the scenes and has a very edgy and naive performance, which deservedly earned him an Oscar nomination. Bruce Willis gave his best performance of his career, not playing a heroic cardboard hero, but showing Cole as a sad, tragic and touching Everyman. Madeleine Stowe is equally good as the psychologist who helps Willis. for her “religion,” she has wild energy and strength, which then collapses under the weight of what she sees as a deceitful faith. Gilliam’s strong, visionary and highly complicated treatment of what could have been a straightforward action and science fiction film makes this a truly unique vision of a nightmarish and demented future. Along with the brilliance of the entire cast and the gloomy and bleak mise-en-scène, this is a true masterpiece of madness. My top ten films, a bleakly magnificent and ingenious spectacle. 10 out of 10.",
    "In one of the first scenes of \"Pulp Fiction,\" two assassins, passing in the streets of a large American city, have just come out of a restaurant and are discussing what is called a burger in other countries. Their conversation is amusing and witty, and the same time disarming because the thugs are very human, and it seems as if they were simply chatting on the way to work. Only the comic effect of the end of the scene, when they take advantage of the conversation to make fun of their victim, gives the scene its meaning. But without it, \"Pulp Fiction\" would not be \"Pulp Fiction\"; I have the impression that Tarantino has included in the film all the things that appealed to him, and, by the way, with such an unconstrained and at the same time disciplined selection, the film not only comes together, but also gains a wonderful variety of tones. No wonder that the abyss of the suitcase has left the audience puzzled and led to various interpretations. The film is so densely layered and so full of surprising details, many of which will not be seen the first time, that it almost demands a deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. “Pulp Fiction,” as the title suggests, is just an exercise in technique and style, a brilliant and multi-layered exercise. It is, with its numerous allusions to other films, like a great abstract art work, or like an \"art about art\". It has all the qualities of great filmmaking: good script, excellent acting, unforgettable characters, and the most elegantly interwoven narration I've ever seen. But what's the point? Its completely self-contained story does not seem to relate to anything but itself. But it's a bit easier to understand when one sees that it is essentially a black comedy disguised as a gangster movie. Each of the three main plots begins with a situation that could easily be the basis for a standard gangster film, but something goes wrong, some small unexpected accident disrupts the situation and leads the desperate characters to absurd measures. The originality of the movie lies in Tarantino's ability to pay attention to small details and let them lead the story, even if they lead it away from the conventional gangster plot. Possibly no screenplay has ever made better use of digressions, or, more accurately, no character ever speaks in a straightforward manner. No, Jules, who has just said to Yolanda: \"It's cool, nobody gets hurt,\" goes on to explain that he's a bit like Fonz, the theme of a different kind of pop culture. Every sentence is deliciously decomposed by Tarantino and instilled with brilliantly clever pop culture references. The sentences are not only witty, they also contain many clever observations about human nature. For example, when Mia says to Vincent: \"You know you've found something when you can just shut up for a minute and enjoy your silence.\" What does this movie want to achieve? I'm not sure, but the central theme is power. Marsellus is one of those characters who dominates the film, although most of the time he is not visible. The big party scene, my favorite, is about Marsellus' power over his men, without his even being there. What makes Vincent act in a way that a stupid, inebriated gangster should not do with a pretty woman whose husband has left for a while, is the power of Marsellus. And it is this theme of power that also justifies the use of the N-word in the movie. It is not only used to describe the blacks in the movie; Jules, for example, calls Vincent that. Because it has more to do with power than race. The powerful characters use the word to show their dominance over the less powerful. Most of these gangsters aren't even racist in their daily lives. * they mingle among each other and have achieved a kind of equality that surpasses the behavior of many decent people. They use the N-word because it serves as a form of expression that marks them off from the rest of society. The story itself develops in a nice moral fashion. Vincent probably hesitates before sleeping with Mia out of fear, rather than out of loyalty. After that, Butch may have been inspired by honor, but it is never clear whether it was. Jules ends up making a clear moral choice, but the central question is whether violent gangsters can ever act for something other than self-interest. This is not a movie about hitmen philosophizing about hamburgers. And the film is not a satire, nor is it a comedy, although there are elements of both. It's a movie that doesn't have to be told, but for whatever reason, this movie does tell it. And it does so better than most other films of its genre or any other genre.",
    "I've been writing for the Internet Movie Database for ten years, and I've noticed something very strange here. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is rated very highly by most of the film's reviewers, but despite all that, the nine and ten-star reviews are being demolished with negative ratings and all the comments are being downgraded to “1 out of 15.” What's going on? The American people shouldn't have been exposed to the real truth about how the police treat minorities every day. The general public shouldn't be so impressed by the story of how young blacks resist the oppression of the law and overcome it. So quick, delete the good reviews! Quick, let's start a backlash! Discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube for their past actions! Let's go and show sympathy for Eazy-E because he's dead and dead black men are fine. Dead ones are no longer scary or threatening. The problem with this film is that the directors had the audacity to portray the young, angry, and black men not as criminals or predators, but as heroic. It's okay to glamorize white criminals, that's how the whole industry was built. From Public Enemy to THE GODFATHER, whites have always loved to love their criminals. But it's not okay for rapping black men to rap about crime, even if they are not criminals themselves. In a certain old movie with James Cagney playing a gangster, that's fine. But today, it's irresponsible and dangerous! There are many very powerful people in this country who are very scared of this film, because this film is able to make whites see black men as something other than dangerous criminals. And the scene where the police were hitting the members of N.W.A., that's the worst threat for the powerful, the ones who rely on the fear of black men. Black male victims can't stand, so immediately, with the media, it's backlash, portraying the victims as criminals. I say it's a good movie, a powerful, compelling movie that shows a side of America that is rarely seen on the big screen. I know I'm not going to get many likes for this review, but I've already had enough of them.",
    "It was my father who paid for me to go and see the notebook with my girlfriends because he kept telling me how great it was. I went just because it was free and had no expectations. But the notebook held me from beginning to end, and I cried for a long time afterward. I, and almost everyone I have talked to, was involved in the situations and the lives of the characters and cried with sadness and rejoiced with joy. I generally find that love stories are very predictable and somewhat boring (in my opinion) but this movie kept me guessing and twisting and turning all the way through. The Notebook was very well made and I would give it eleven out of ten.",
    "You heard it right. Footloose is based on a TRUE story. It happened in a small town in Oklahoma in the year 1980. My father, whose real name is Leonard (Ned) Coffee, was at the center of it. Ren McCormack (also known as Kevin Bacon—hmm, coincidence?) was a junior at Elmore City High School. The population of the town was a mere 750 souls, and with around 50 Baptist churches, the local ordinances were rather conservative. The town had an ancient ordinance against public dancing that had never been repealed. In other words, Elmore had never had a prom. My father fought for a repeal with the help of his best friend, Rex Kennedy, president of the junior class, and they were granted their wish. Elmore has had a prom every year since. I don’t know who sold the story, but unfortunately, we didn’t get any money for it! It isn’t exactly like the movie (except that my father drove the same car Ren drove, which is why my father had to go to the prom in a nearby town). But, at the heart of the story, the real Ren was based on my father. And there you have it—the true story behind Footloose! If you haven’t seen it yet, go!",
    "People who watch the Academy Awards have little interest in the Foreign Language film nominations. Incendies is the kind of film that leaves you empty of all emotion, which haunts you for days. It is like a deeply personal experience and it takes a long time to digest the film’s plot, a touching one, full of emotional ups and downs and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films festival, where I saw the film yesterday, director Denis Villeneuve said that he had already directed four Canadian films, but that this was the first to be distributed in the U.S. “I can’t see why Villeneuve, or any of his actors, shouldn’t have a brilliant future.” Jeanne and Simon are twins who have just lost their mother, Nawal. In her will, Nawal instructs Jeanne and Simon to deliver an envelope to a brother they didn’t know they had, living in an unnamed Middle Eastern country. Only then will the two siblings be able to afford a decent burial for their mother. Jeanne is determined to deliver the envelope, and when she gets there she finds out some of the most painful things about her mother’s past. The film unfolds with each revelation about Nawal, and by the end the viewer has been stunned into silence. I have already praised the story, but one thing I must add is that Villeneuve has said that the script is four hours long. It is remarkable that the film succeeds so well in its compact form, because I can’t imagine that anything has been trimmed from it. But to back up this solid material, there is some truly fine acting. The whole cast has so much passion in their acting that it seems as if the film were autobiographical. The cinematography is so dreary, a tribute perhaps to the desert of the Middle East country where the film takes place, that it echoes the lives of Nawal and Jeanne. But the film is full of long, long, long takes that make the viewer gasp with their unnerving silences. I have no idea why Villeneuve had not received critical acclaim in the U.S. before this, but then I have seen a good number of films about the Middle East, and although some of them are deeply flawed and fail to evoke any emotion in me, others like The Hurt Locker or The Secret War have been spectacularly successful. Incendies is the best film I have ever seen about the Middle East, and although it has its faults—and it could have done with trimming by a few minutes—it is of the rare kind that remains in the memory after the first viewing. Incendies may some day be remembered as the brilliant film that brought fame to Denis Villeneuve.",
    "“The story I am about to tell is my life story. I was born in Bombay in 1983. I was adopted by an Italian family when I was just two years old. My father told me that the nuns found me on the street and took me to an orphanage in Solur. My father took me away from there and brought me to Italy. We stayed there for a month and then came back to Italy. I don’t have any memories of that country. It will be very difficult for me to understand the place where I was born, but I will come back one day. I have to come back to India. The film ‘Pazhuvoor’ has changed my life.",
    "With the workers’ strike in Russia, the crew of the Potemkin feels a special sympathy for their comrades, and when they are served rotten meat crawling with maggots, some of them object and are promptly pushed into front of a firing squad. And only at the last minute is the ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk to rescue the fellows by pleading with the firing squad to disregard the orders of their captain. After the officers take revenge and murder Vakulinchuk, all are drawn into a conflict that reaches all the way ashore to Odessa, where the rebellion spreads to the point of a bloody uprising. I had never seen this film before, but had seen many a reference to it in other films, and so considered it an important film to see at least once. The film is based on a real event, and that only makes it more interesting, but even without that the narrative is good. The characters are not all that compelling, but the events are brutal and unjust, and that is what drew me to the film—it shows its horror in its surprisingly violent manner (which implies more than sheer gore) and lets innocent people be killed on all sides in key scenes. The version I saw was said to be with its original score (I am not trying to be snobbish—to be fair, modern rescoring might be better—but I have no way of knowing), and the score is effective at enhancing and matching the film’s mood, whether it is dark and mournful, or dramatic and uproarious. The film’s technique held up rather well for my modern eyes, and though there were a few moments where the model work was unmistakable, on the whole the film is technically well done. The crowds, the ships, the cities, and the way the chaos is all so effectively filmed are very impressive, and could be accomplished even today. What is even more impressive is the fact that the film has a very clear and strong visual style; unlike many silent films I have seen, it is not as rough and flat, as many I have seen in the last few years have been, and it is instead very crisp and professional looking. Of course, in seeing it now, I am able to see how many images have been influenced by it, as well as interviews with directors who have mentioned it; but even without that benefit, the film is still a work of its time, and one can see how many of its shots are memorable, and two of the best examples are the step and the firing squad. The acting, though, might not be to everyone’s taste, as it is not to mine. There are a few moments when the actors seem to overdo it a little, as they have to show their emotions in ways that actors today would rely on dialogue. Besides that, it is a classic film that has influenced many directors, and the story is interesting and the acting is effective; the music is effective at creating the emotionality that a modern film would have to be earned by the acting and dialogue, and the whole is over much too quickly! The film is a must-see for film lovers, and it is also a very good film.",
    "The best film to be made in the period of Daniel Craig's James Bond. Well acted. Best performances by Daniel Craig, Judi Dench and Javier Bardem, all three brilliant. Excellent action sequences. The story line is pretty complex and touches upon the relationship between M and Bond, of which little is known. Sam Mendes does a masterful job directing this installment in the James Bond series. After this film, you can compare Daniel Craig to Sean Connery.",
    "I saw the movie earlier and even though I had very high expectations, I was still very pleased with it. It is known that the Turkish film industry lacks special effects. That is the main reason why we are unable to appreciate Turkish action films. However, in this film, we see many splendid examples of special effects. The scenes with the soldiers were so excellent, lively and natural. The movie has a plot that deserves the highest praise. In addition to the good special and sound effects, the movie has a good storyline. As I mentioned earlier, I had very high expectations and this film was even better than I expected. Thank you Mr. Alper Caglar for letting us enjoy such a magnificent film.",
    "I have never written a review here before, but I feel compelled to take a stand for this film. The Bourne legacy was everything I had expected it to be. It couldn’t be too close to the previous Bourne films, but close enough to forewarn us of impending storms. Bourne’s presence throughout the film drives the action and I felt it was perfectly balanced. We all want Bourne, but this is the story of Aaron Cross. Renner and Weisz were brilliant, but the script has been panned by many. I had no issue with it and even felt the drive that made Renner’s character what he was. Someone who longed to be better, not someone who was already better than everyone else but had forgotten it. Let’s hope that we get what we all want and that Bourne and Cross are paired up in the next film.",
    "This is the nastiest of the Scary Movie films. If you thought the first one was “too much,” then you will definitely be able to avoid this one because of its sluttish content and crude sex jokes. Here are your words. This was one of my favorite movies when I first saw it in the theater. I loved its crude sex jokes and sluttish spoofs. So if you’re into that sort of thing, you’ll love this one. The opening sequence is absolutely hilarious and, in my opinion, the best part of the film. It was about time the Scary Movie franchise gave us a spoof of The Exorcist! James Woods is hysterical as Father Merrin, and most of his scenes are filled with scatological jokes and profanity. For example, when Regan says, “Stuff it,” Father Merrin immediately crawls into her bed and pretends to penetrate her. Another example is when Regan’s mother says, “She won’t let me near her!” and the priest says, “Yes, sometimes that happens, you’ve got to give candy to the children”—a clear allusion to the recent child molestation scandals. On the other hand, the film does contain some classic but always effective teenage humor, like the scene where Father Merrin enters the room for the first time and gets scared and runs away when Regan turns around in her chair; and, of course, there’s the vomiting scene. After the spoof of The Exorcist, the film mostly spoofs Poltergeist and The Entity. It then heads off in a new direction and never looks back. You can expect to see spoofs of popular commercials and songs (Vitamin C), and even a few racial and homophobic jokes. Despite all the profanity, Scary Movie 2 never crosses the line. It’s just a funny R-rated comedy that has something for everyone—unless, that is, you take yourself too seriously. You must make sure to see it on DVD, because the TV version is heavily censored (especially during the dialogue). It’s my opinion that this is the best of the Scary Movies.",
    "Don’t judge this film by the name. You can hate it for any reason you like, but this film is not just a stupid, mindless, meaningless, sexual fantasy. There’s much more thought behind it than you can imagine. However, the film was so poorly received by the critics because they couldn’t understand it, and the public blindly followed their lead. The film is essentially about Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), the star of the film. Director Zanny Snydman emphasized that from the beginning. Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is a figment of Sweet Pea’s imagination. She is the embodiment of Sweet Pea’s fantasies. She is Sweet Pea’s angel. The entire film is Sweet Pea’s inner struggle. It is she who narrates the film. All that we see with Baby Doll in the first act is Sweet Pea expressing her inner feelings, as she learned at the asylum. It is Sweet Pea expressing her inner feelings on the stage when she first enters the asylum, which is the theater. After that comes the lobotomy, which is the key to everything that follows. Sweet Pea, seen through the eyes of Baby Doll, loses contact with reality when the needle is injected into her brain. She retreats into her mind, as Dr. Gorski taught her to. She is no longer in the real world. This is what happened to Sweet Pea in real life. And the result of this lobotomy is this film. Yes, this film is the result of a lobotomy. It is a whole subconscious coping mechanism in order to find peace. And Sweet Pea is able to break in on the lobotomy, to interrupt her own story. She even has a way of turning the accidental death of her sister into a deliberate and necessary sacrifice to save her. This is the beginning of the second act. Sweet Pea imagines herself, with Baby Doll and the other girls, in a brothel, with an audience, in which she plays a role, with the audience watching her. That’s why we, the audience, are watching the performance in which these girls show themselves in various costumes. This means that, by choosing to watch the film, we have made ourselves complicit in everything that is going on. Of course, I am not criticizing you for your desire to see pretty young girls kick butts. The film is essentially about the difference between emancipation and exploitation. The film is in three tiers: the asylum, the brothel, and the fantasy-action scenes. Each tier represents a different phase of the feminist movement. The first tier, the asylum, is a dark reflection of the sixties, of the second wave of feminism, in which women were not seen as equals. And this inequality is accentuated in the second world, the brothel, which is even further back in time, when women were literally treated as property. the third tier, the modern world, reflects the dancing of Baby Doll through all the aspects of popular culture, in which the girls are dressed in all the typical outfits in which they are portrayed in popular culture: in manga, in comics, in manga, in animation, in science fiction, in action films, in horror films. Sweet Pea is aware of the sick side of this, and doesn’t want to be emancipated by it. But by seeing how the men are affected, they learn how powerful they really are, and how they can use their own sexuality to regain control over the men. For the men, who were once powerful over women, are now vulnerable. The reverse of the historic role of men and women is shown. This is then reflected to the same extent in the action-fantasy scenes, in which it is as if the women are seizing control of this male-dominated genre that has been dominated by men and their male fraternity for far too long. But the scene when Baby Doll is being lobotomized after Sweet Pea has found peace shows how even the lobotomized can have her moment. While Sweet Pea is imagining that she is escaping from her prison on the magic bus, Blue is preparing to do something about it. But it’s too late, she has already escaped, even if it’s just in her mind. Blue has power over her body, but without her mind he has nothing. And we see the importance of this in Baby Doll’s encounter with High Roller, who realizes that to love or not to love is a decision that can only be made by the one being loved. Whether it’s love or exploitation is entirely a matter of personal choice, and that’s the whole point of this film. Women have a right to control their bodies as well as their minds. This film is open to so many interpretations that it’s impossible to give a definitive meaning. It’s really quite remarkable that the director and producer are men, and that the man who defends the film is a man. If this film had been made by someone like a Kubrick, then everyone would have tried to understand the deeper meaning and wouldn’t have been bothered by the bad reviews. It’s really very sad that the people who have seen a Snider film are only prepared to see it in black and white, and see nothing beyond the surface, using no thought to interpret the images on the screen.",
    "This film is never going to win an Academy Award, but it surprised me and has become my favorite movie this summer. The story is simple, as all good summer comedies should be. Two guys, who attend weddings to meet women, have some wild adventures and find out something. But the real joy of the film is the actors, who play their roles very well. It is a middle-aged surfer from California who is ready to grow up and Vince Vaughn is his best friend, a spoiled, but decent, young man. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the bride. So if you have seen Owen Wilson in Shanghai Noon, Vince Vaughn in Swingers and Christopher Walken in... well, just about everything he has ever done, you've seen these characters before, but here they work together perfectly. The film is filled with just enough real emotion to make you care and just enough absurdity and wacky gestures to make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's fun. Recommended.",
    "For the rest, the play is in three acts, with a brief epilogue. It is occupied by Briony, the younger daughter of the rich and aristocratic Tallis family, her elder sister, Cecilia, and by Robie Turner, a close friend of her sister’s, and a brilliant boy. Robie is the son of a maid-servant of the family; but he has received a good education, and has been a chorister at a grammar-school and at Cambridge, where he obtained a First. His prospects are brilliant in whatever direction he may turn; and he wishes to enter the medical profession. ACT I: We open in the Tallis family’s country house, on a hot summer’s day in the year ’35. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old girl, aspires to become an author; and she has composed a play which she and her three cousins are to perform. But the play is doomed to failure, because of disagreements among the performers. Robie is in love with Cecilia; and he sends her a passionate love-letter by mistake. Under other circumstances this would have been a matter for disgrace; but since she has returned his love, the accident proves to be a happy one. But the mood of the film is suddenly changed by the occurrence of a criminal charge, and the imprisonment of Robie, who has been falsely charged with the assault. Lola is unable to identify her assailant; but Briony, who was a witness, wrongfully accuses Robie. >ACT II: We now see Robie, freed from prison, fighting for his country in France. The war is going badly; and the enemy is about to reach Dunkirk. But the one thing that keeps him going is the hope of seeing Cecilia again. She has supported him throughout his trial and imprisonment, and has been estranged from her family. For her part, Briony is beginning to have misgivings about her identification of Robie as Lola’s assailant, and offers to recant her statement. She is determined to act as a nurse, and to give her life to the service of the wounded, as a means of atonement for the damage which she has caused to an innocent man and to her family. After his appearance in The Last King of Scotland and Becoming Jane, James McEvoy has come to the fore as the leading male star of British films, and his performance in this film is his best so far. I was a little disappointed in both the film and the story, and, above all, in the way that the story was handled. But whereas Dr Garrigan in The Last King of Scotland had an element of the sinister about him, and Legroy in Becoming Jane was, for the most part, a likeable rogue, Robie is unquestionably a hero. The casting of him was a good decision, and the fact that he is working with director Joe Wright (after Pride and Prejudice) is another guarantee of the film’s success. A good performance, too, from Keira Knightley, who, although she was very good in Bend it Like Beckham, is at her best in the films which Joe Wright has directed, and it seems to me that she should not look to the future of her career in Hollywood blockbusters like The Devil’s Double, where she was, if anything, out of her depth. She is not only the loveliest but also the liveliest and the most spirited of the film’s leading ladies. I would like to make special mention of Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony, and of Vanessa Redgrave as the elderly Briony in the epilogue, which is set in the year 1999. Her daughter, however, is convincing, and it was a good decision to cast her as little Briony. In the second film of his career, Joe Wright has shown himself to be an excellent director. His previous film, Pride and Prejudice, was excellent, but Atonement is even better. I doubt that any adaptation of the novel could ever have caught all its subtleties, for a number of reasons. Among other things, there is a central theme in the novel, a kind of dialogue between modernism and traditionalism in literature, which cannot be properly conveyed by the cinematic medium, and which Joe Wright and the scriptwriter, Christopher Hampton, avoid at all costs. The last twist of the plot is also kept, although the situation is changed slightly, with Briony finally telling the truth in an interview on national TV. The film, however, is not only capable of capturing the novel’s emotional undercurrents, but also of a very lively and vivid visual sense, something which is sometimes missing in films based on novels. Atonement now joins the list of films (like A Single Man and Girl with a Pearl Earring) in which nearly every scene has the feel of a painting. This is true of the first part, set in the beautiful stately home (the actual setting is the manor house at Stokesay in Shropshire), and of the second, which is set in the war, in which Joe Wright can see a horrible beauty in war, particularly in the burning town and the long shot of the beaches of Dunkirk in grey morning light. With regard to the war and the behavior of the characters, I found the line “Dear Lord and Father of Men” very touching, because the second line of the poem by John Greenleaf Whittier, “Forgive our folly”, was so apt. Also very good was Dario Marianelli’s music, which was an appropriate choice for a film in which writing plays an important role. It is a fine film, and I only hope that its British origins and the fact that it was released in the late summer (when blockbusters dominate) will not prejudice the Academy against it in next year’s awards. I give it a full ten out of ten in my opinion.",
    "It was a true golden age of animation for both the purest Disney and the purest Pixar fans. For me, at least, this was the first time that I thought the Disney takeover of Pixar would prove to be a positive development for the animated film pioneers. It contained what were probably Pixar’s most beautiful scenes and character designs (sidenote: Merida’s is my favorite character design of any animated human being.) It also contained the studio’s best score. Besides, Brave was also a deft send-up of classic fairytales, with the same magical, eerie feeling that typified their work. I hope it gets better and better over time. If Wreck-It Ralph was Pixar doing Disney, Brave was Pixar doing Disney.",
    "First of all, it's an Adam Sandler movie. If you hate Adam Sandler movies, you won't like it. I gave it 8/10 because it was one of the better Adam Sandler movies. The plot and storyline was better than I expected, the character development was quite good as well. There were a few moments when I wanted to hit myself in the face because it was so slapstick funny. Yes, it's highly unrealistic, but if you're looking for realism, what the hell are you looking for? Yes, I know, it's a dumb story about an ugly woman who fucks her a lot, but she played it quite well.",
    "After reading the first couple of Harry Potter books before the year 2001, and having heard about the buzz surrounding the first movie, I was excited. It was going to be a British cast (which seems only natural), and we would be seeing on screen one of the great novels of our time. I think I went with my family and a family friend on the day after Christmas to see the movie and was pleasantly surprised. I sat through the credits and recognized some of the names: the late Alan Rickman, the late Dame Maggie Smith, the late James Bond, James Bond, Robbie Coltrane, and the late Warwick Davis, and many children, some of whom were making their first movie. But it was a good movie and a party of sights and sounds for the whole family. This is easily my favorite of the Harry Potter movies. The igniting spark for the whole series!",
    "Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a movie like no other I've ever seen, nor probably will I ever see again. It's a real epic that leaves me completely speechless. It achieves so much with so little. Everything about it is sublime, from the elegant direction, to the understated and brilliant acting, to the fantastic music. It makes you feel not only for the death we see, but for the unbelievable life that is revealed to us. It deals with obvious moral issues, but also with the premise that we all experience the same joys and sufferings, but not all of them in the same way. This is a major story, worthy of no less than greatness. This visually and emotionally rich movie tells the story of the life of a very strange man, born at the beginning of the twentieth century and growing old backwards. The story is told in his diary, which his beloved Daisy is reading. Through his life, he experiences what we all experience, growing up and then, finally, aging. He is a thoughtful observer, learning to see life from all sides. But it is not his life that makes him unique. It is his love that makes him unique. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how he loves Daisy, and still only manages a few incredible years of loving her. And as their lives show us, the years of frustration and struggle are all worth it for a few moments of happiness. The direction is nearly perfect, and I hope this movie will bring director David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He keeps time so well and with such grace that the movie has an unavoidable flow, and is enjoyable from beginning to end. At nearly three hours, there is not a minute wasted. Each shot is absolutely stunning, and although some may complain about the time, I think it is very well used. This is Brad Pitt's best role, and he is so believable and so natural throughout. His subtlety is extraordinary, and despite the heavy makeup and CGI used to show us his character, it is Pitt that makes him so strange. There is not a single part in this movie that I would not like to see again. After so much anticipation, I was not disappointed. It is an extraordinarily elegant picture of life, love, and loss. However, this is probably not a movie for everyone. It is not the ordinary romance, and it does not hold your hand. But it is a great and astonishing movie, and it is certainly a gem. What makes our lives unforgettable are the moments we don't seem to want to keep. Life is a very strange thing in itself, and Benjamin Button is no less a miracle.",
    "I have liked most of the digital animated films that have been made so far, from the Pixar Toy Story and The Incredibles to DreamWorks’ Shrek. But ‘Finding Nemo’ is unique, not because of its comedy or its originality, both of which are equalled in the Toy Story films and “Monsters, Inc.”, but because it really, more than any of the other digitally animated films, reinvents the genre of children’s animation. In the case of ‘Finding Nemo’ the funny is more subtle. Often it is based on physical and social comedy, and when seagulls crash into a boat you can see their beaks cocking on the other side of the sails. But it is precisely these details that make the film all the more astonishingly different from the cartoon clichés of the past. It gives a surprisingly scientific appearance to its world of thinking animals. All animals are based on real species. The tanks in which the fish live are built according to genuine instruments. There is a strong sense of place, since Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, and even the animals speak with an Australian accent. A pelican and a group of fish discuss the finer points of dentistry. The fact that the animals can talk and understand the events that are taking place is taken as natural. This realism is so striking that by the end of the film one believes that fish can indeed escape from the tank. But this approach, far from making the film pedantic, results in an intelligent but entertaining film, based on parodies of human behaviour: remorseful sharks start an AA-like club, a school of fish makes itself into an impressive pattern and behaves like some embarrassing Djs and goes about its business with an impertinent and destructive energy. Concluding with Marlin’s (Albert Brooks) finding his son in the most original way, it is worth the film’s reliance on coincidence. This film follows the same general pattern as Toy Story, in which two people, one fussy and the other uneducated, are forced to travel together through a world of animals that are much more intelligent than people think. But the movie creates a unique and ingenious character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a genuine human disease is certainly daring, and it is a good thing that the makers had the courage to do so, because not only does this device give some of the best jokes of the film, but it is also a key factor in the interaction of characters, which is the whole point of the film. At this point, we see true character development: on the journey, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, receiving parenting advice from a surfer-like turtle (voiced by the director, Andrew Stanton), while his son Nemo learns to be independent. And all the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters and humans that Marlin encounters on the way mean nothing but their business. According to Nigel the pelican, “Fish swim, birds eat”. This is perhaps the film’s most interesting insight, that there are no real villains, only creatures acting according to their nature, and a few who transcend it.",
    "What a marvellously fearless and honest portrait of a relationship! I have never seen such a precise and accurate filmic transfer of these emotions as in Before Sunrise. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke nor Julie Delpy have been nominated for an award for this film, but a great deal! Neither have Richard Linklater for the screenplay and the brilliant way of directing these wonderful actors. I loved the ending (though it also hurt), I loved that it returned to all the places the couple had visited. I loved the way the dialogue never wavered, that it did not directly deal with the relationship, but indirectly showed how the bond between the two grew through body language, facial expressions and words. Every word of it comes from those top ten talks we have all had with a close friend, either seriously or playfully. And respect to Richard Linklater for keeping it real: the film was rated R for two or three swear words, which could easily have been taken out, but which he left in anyway. No, to hell with you, Hollywood, your romantic comedies, your Freddie Prinzes, your take the glasses off and she's a pretty girl pictures! Here is real love! This is what I come to the cinema for, to be challenged, to think, to be transported by that magic that only cinema can create. Before Sunrise alone has reminded me of why I go to the movies...",
    "I saw this film on the 19th of July in a small advance screening, knowing nothing about it except that it had a fantasy adventure theme and starred some familiar actors. The storyline is really original and originality is highly appreciated when everything that is coming out is the same thing. Despite first impressions, the film is not at all tacky, corny, trite, stupid, and it is actually incredibly funny and enjoyable. The story is paced well; nothing feels too rushed or too drawn out. The music, or as I call it, is very magical and really enhances the film, rather than just filling silence as often happens in films and on television. I must admit that even though I perhaps suspected what was going to happen at certain points, I still couldn’t take my eyes off the screen, and as far as I know no one in the auditorium left during the screening. My only complaint is that there doesn’t seem to be much marketing for this film and with it being as good as it is, I don’t understand why.",
    "The advertisements of this film do it a great disservice. I stood in the lobby of a movie theater where there was a free screening, and I almost didn’t go in because the advertisements and trailers had convinced me that it was just a pointless waste of time. It appears that this film is nothing but a big number of shirts kicking each other and a few pretty girls in bikinis. Not only are there many of both, but it also has a good storyline and a strong theme. In terms of the theme, the film is about taking responsibility for your actions, about controlling your emotions and making good decisions. It is as much about the reasons for the courage as about the macho. Yes, it is a teen film, rich kids run around in mansions and drive expensive cars, but it’s only the setting. There are also people who kick the living daylights out of each other, but it is only a means to an end, the heart of the film is about personal development and choices. It is not the best film of the year, and it is possible that it will be a midnight film on cable in a few months, but it is by no means as bad as people think. It is worth the price of a rental and worth ten dollars to see it in the theater, if you have nothing else to do. I blame the negative reactions on the advertising, which seems to sell it as “just another fighting film.”",

    "In computer science, formal specifications are mathematically based methods intended to assist in the development of systems and programs. They are used to describe a system, to analyze its behavior, and to design it by verifying certain important properties by powerful and precise reasoning. Formal specifications are those which have a syntax, a specific semantics, and are adapted to the derivation of useful information. The motivation is that, with each decade, the power of the machines increases and their impact on society increases. Better tools are needed to assist in the design and implementation of reliable software. The traditional engineering methods are based on mathematical analysis, a foundation which enables the design and the proof of the design of the products. Formal specifications are a way to achieve this in the case of the reliability of the software. Other methods such as testing are used more often to ensure the quality of the code.",

    "Food First, also called the Institute for Food and Development Policy, is a non-profit association based in Oakland, California. Founded in 1975 by Frances Moore Lappé and Joseph Collins, it calls itself a “think-tank and action centre for the public”. Its mission is to fight the injustices that lead to hunger. According to its own site, the objective is “to establish food sovereignty in the interest of human rights and sustainable development”, and to this end it has three programs of action: local agri-food systems, farmers building food sovereignty, democratizing development. The organization carries out policy studies on poverty, agriculture and development, and is harshly critical of the policies imposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It is particularly critical of the green revolution which was supported in the seventies, and which did not achieve the development that was expected. It established a system of farming that has high costs, but which does not give much higher yields than those of traditional agriculture. A resurgence of the same ideas has been seen lately, especially with the support given to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and to agribusiness of high yields. The policy of Food First is that these are incompatible with the goals of a fair and lasting development. Several policy papers have been produced to this end.",

They were classified into five species with several subspecies; but changes in their classification in the light of the phylogenetic species concept point to the existence of many more species in the cryptic species complex. Many species occur in mountain forests, but some of them also descend to lower altitudes during the winter.

    "Since that time, a physicist, acoustician, Floyd A. Firestone (1898–1986), was the first to use a practical ultrasonic testing device and method. He was granted a patent for his invention in 1942, and the device, manufactured by Sperry, was variously known as the Firestone–Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope, and, finally, sometimes as the Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name given by Firestone to the instrument. The technique is not only used for quality control in the factory and for rejecting defective parts, it also revolutionized the safety of transportation. For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance of railcars, mainly of wheels and axles, airplanes, mainly of the fuselage, and other ships for the fatigue strength of the materials. Dr. Firestone's ultrasonic pulse–echo method for metal defect detection later found application in medical diagnostics, giving birth to the field of echocardiography and the field of medical ultrasonography. Dr. Firestone served as editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1939 to 1957. Among many other inventions by Firestone are, in a single year, an \"automatic device for minute flaw detection\", \"a new and useful way of connecting electric devices\" and \"a noise measuring device\", and even a \"musical typewriter\" later. In 1933, Firestone proposed an alternative analogy to James Clerk Maxwell's analogy of the analog in which force is analogous to the voltage (impedance analogy). In the Firestone analogy (now known as the mobility analogy), force is analogous to the current. He introduced the concept of \"through\" and \"over\" for the variables, and showed that there are analogs for these variables in other energy domains, so that the entire system can be treated as a whole in the analysis. Firestone's analogy was a favorite among mechanics for designing mechanical filters because it had the property of preserving the topology of the network when transforming between the mechanical and electrical domains.",

    "The “100th Window” is the fourth studio album by the English musical group, Massive Attack, and was released on February 10, 2003, on Virgin Records. Of the original members, only Robert Del Naja is present on the album; Andrew Vowles left the band after the release of Mezzanine in 1998, and Grant Marshall refused to work on the album. The album was composed and produced by Del Naja and Neil Davidge, and features the vocals of Horace Andy, Sinéad O’Connor and Damon Albarn as 2D, from Gorillaz. It is the first album by the group not to be made with the help of samples and to lack the jazz-influenced jazz-fusion of its first two albums, Blue Lines and Protection. The composition of the album began in early 2000 at the Clifton studios in Bristol. It is made with the help of Lupine Howl, a band composed of former members of the group Spiritualized. In a November, 2001, interview, the singer of the band, Sean Cook, says that the session is \"very experimental... it consists of rather minimal loops and noises that they send to our headphones from a machine in the control room. \" From there, we had a kind of long jam session, while they changed the loops, sometimes cut it off, sometimes distorted it with delay and effects, to see how it would affect the playing. There was also a strobe light installed in the studio, from which they controlled from the control room, turning it on and off, making it strobe faster and slower, thus determining the speed and determining the extent of the effects on our playing. It was great fun and we had a lot of good stuff. I mean, they recorded for hours. Now they're cutting and rearranging and making their own tracks. \"",

    "Ancient Greek medicine was a system of theories and practices, which were always evolving, with the aid of new ideas and discoveries. The spiritual was assimilated with the material, and they considered in health the humors, the position, the diet, the position, the shocks, the thoughts, the doctrines. Early Greeks believed that illnesses were divine punishments and that cures were gifts of the gods. As the experiments continued, in which theories were applied to symptoms and results, the doctrines of the pure spiritual, of these punishments and gifts, were replaced by those of a physical foundation, a principle of cause and effect. Humorism (or the four humors) is composed of blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. Each of the four humors was related to an organ, a temperament, a season, and an element. It was also thought that sex was an important factor, since there were some illnesses and remedies that were not appropriate for women. Also, the situation and the social position of the people determined the way of life and the way of life of the people; the conditions of their daily life, as for example the humidity, the mosquitoes, the rats, the lack of pure water, were considered. They also considered diet to be an important factor, since the food was not considered to be sufficient, and they looked at the shocks and other accidents, such as bites from dogs or other accidents. Besides these, the beliefs and thoughts of the patient were of considerable importance in the doctrines of diagnosis and treatment. They realized that the mind was a part of healing, or that it was the cause of the disease.",

By what natural law does it follow that if we could not change ourselves for the better, then we must change our environment in which we live.” Then I read on, “We must consider that which determines our environment for us. This is the most natural of laws, namely, the principle of least resistance. The challenge is to realize that it is not within ourselves, but the environment that we live in, which determines us.

    "The “Jinzhong Forum on Literature and Art” was held in May 1942 in the city of Yan’an in China, and was an important event in the Yan’an Rectification Movement. It was most notable for the speech delivered by Mao Zedong, which was subsequently compiled and published as ‘Talks on the Jingxing Forum on Literature and Art’, with its two main points being that all art should be based on the life of the proletariat and serve them as its audience, and that art should serve politics and its aim of promoting socialism. The former of these points was excessively emphasized in the Cultural Revolution, so the current party policy is to reject it while continuing to support art based on the life of the proletariat. Before that time, the art organized by the C.P.P., such as the People’s Anti-Japanese Art Society, had mainly had the purpose of expressing resistance to Japan, as in “Resisting the Japanese” and “Fight the Japanese”. The Party had also established in 1938 the Lu Xun Academy of Art in Yan’an in order to train people in literature, music, fine arts and theatre.",

The convolutional neural network is trained on a large set of annotated cardiac images to learn the spatial and contextual information needed for accurate segmentation. The shape refinement method then refines the initial segmentation by incorporating shape priors and enforces smoothness constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. This method can potentially assist the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac diseases by providing reliable, accurate biventricular segmentations of cardiac images.",
    "This article deals with the curvature tensors of Hermitian manifolds. A full analysis is given of the various curvature tensors which can be defined on such manifolds, such as the Ricci curvature tensor, the scalar curvature tensor and the Weyl curvature tensor. The relations between these tensors and their properties are studied. A few examples and applications of these tensors on Hermitian manifolds are presented. In conclusion, the article gives a better understanding of the geometrical properties of Hermitian manifolds and is a starting point for future research in this area.",
    "This paper presents a novel method for fusing localization and segmentation of objects in images and videos by the concept of clustering. The method first generates candidate segmentations from a convolutional neural network, which have been previously trained, and then uses the foreground clustering technique to group the proposals into coherent foreground objects. The clustering technique combines the appearance and motion information of foreground objects to detect the coherence of foreground objects in space and time. The experimental results show that the proposed method is very effective for segmenting and localizing foreground objects in images and videos. It is also very suitable for the following computer vision tasks: video object segmentation, object tracking, and scene understanding.",
    "Here we present a multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach for thalamic segmentation. The fusion is performed using a 3D convolutional neural network. This network is trained on a large set of segmented thalamus from different MRI contrasts. The model is then tested on a separate test set, and the results indicate that the method can reliably segment the thalamus. The thalamus can then be used for other analyses such as network analysis. We are also presenting a comparison with other methods. WIREs Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 6:e17001, pp. 1–13. The thalamus is a major brain structure which is involved in all types of incoming and outgoing communication with the brain. MRI is a useful tool for studying the thalamus and other brain structures. Here, we are presenting a multi-contrast MRI method for thalamic segmentation, based on the fusion of T1 and T2 and DTI scans, using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). The network is trained on a large set of segmented thalami from different MRI scans. The model is then tested on a separate test set, and the results indicate that the method can reliably segment the thalamus.",
    "We introduce a new formulation of the reconstruction of a conductivity distribution inside a uniformly conductive, opaque, periodic sample from the measurement of the electric field at the sample surface. The classic reconstruction of E-M is based on the Kirchhoff approximation, where the conductivity is expressed as a finite set of values and the inverse problem is solved as a non-linear optimization problem. Unlike the classic approach, which fails when the discretized conductivity imposes a significant distortion on the internal electric field, we show that the convex-constrained power-law graph cuts, a new convex optimization technique, can recover the true conductivity distribution quite accurately even in the presence of significant distortion.",
    "We introduce a novel approach to the study of the formation of agglomerates of polymers based on the statistical mechanics of a large number of mutually interpenetrating forces. We formulate a generalized master equation describing the evolution of the conformational space of the polymer over time, which we then use to deduce a set of self-consistent equations governing the equilibrium properties of the system. Our method enables us to study the effects of different types of interaction and to determine the conditions under which the formation of the agglomerate occurs. We find that the formation of the agglomerate is a multistep process, with the initial stages of formation controlled by the local interactions between the constituent parts, while the subsequent stages of formation are governed by global properties of the system, such as the total number of constituent parts and the average size of the aggregate. Our method provides a quantitative understanding of the process of aggregation and can be used to predict the effects of different types of interactions on the aggregation process.",

    "We present a new method for combining object segmentation and localization in images and videos. Our method exploits the spatial coherence of objects in images and frames to optimize the segments and the boxes simultaneously. To do this, we introduce a new energy function that tightly couples the segmentation term, which is based on a variant of the GrabCut algorithm, and the localization term, which is based on a new objectness measure that we introduce. To efficiently optimize the energy function, we propose a new foreground clustering strategy that allows us to handle the sparse and irregular object pixel assignments, and simultaneously optimize the segments and the boxes. To evaluate our method, we propose a new fully automatic evaluation measure that estimates the accuracy of localization in terms of ground truth object bounding boxes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the VOC 2012 object segmentation test set, substantially improving on the previous best method on this test set, while running at near-real-time speed. In addition, we show that our foreground clustering strategy can improve the performance of recent methods for combining object segmentation and localization. This makes our method a strong foundation for future research.",

The extraction of boundaries from blurred images is a challenging problem due to the lack of clear edge information. Our method aims to utilize the power of semantic information to learn encoder features that can capture the subtle detail of blurred images. Combining the advantages of encoders and semantic-guided feature learning, we obtain the best performance in the literature for blurry boundary delineation. We evaluated our method on a standard dataset and obtained significant improvements compared to existing methods. We also showed that our method is robust to noise and variation of texture, and can obtain accurate and reliable boundaries in blurred images.",
    "This paper aims to explore the concept of quantum objectivity, mainly with respect to observation. It is assumed that a quantum system has no properties until it is observed, and that the act of observation is not passive, but rather an active process that influences the results of the measurements. The paper tries to draw the consequences of these ideas for the concept of objectivity in the quantum world and suggests that objectivity in the quantum world is not as simple as in classical physics. Also discussed is the idea that quantum objectivity may be dependent on the observer’s state of mind and that the observer’s expectations and beliefs may influence the results of the measurements. The paper concludes that the concept of quantum objectivity may be more complex and multiple than previously assumed and that further research is necessary to fully understand it.",
    "The LeViT-UNet method encodes images faster and better than other encoders for medical images. Previously, the encoders were designed with a series of convolutional and pooling layers, and the resulting model was redundant, and the processing was largely inefficient. This method takes the LeViT concept introduced by Johnson et al. and combines the advantages of the Transformer model with the efficient encoder. It is faster than other encoders, and its performance in medical image segmentation is comparable to that of other encoders. The code and related materials are available at:",
    "I propose an active contour method for image segmentation which is based on the diffuse interface theory of phase transitions. The active contour in the image is treated as a diffuse interface between two phases. The propagation of this diffuse interface is governed by a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) derived from the diffuse interface theory. In the physical model of the active contour, the energy function of the active contour model is expressed in terms of the form of a Hamiltonian, and the evolution of the active contour can be found by solving the system of PDEs governed by the Hamiltonian. An efficient level-set method is proposed for solving the proposed model. The method is tested on several images. It is found that it is effective and efficient in the task of image segmentation.",
    "ANOTHER way of classifying the objects is to work with the plane figures which are represented by the straight lines. It is easy to use the plane figures for the purposes of the recognition, but to classify them based on their reciprocal relationships, with the help of the Markov random field (MRF). The Markov random field is a mathematical device which is able to carry out operations which the other methods of classification are unable to do. The advantages of this method are: The Markov random field enables the individual objects to be combined and compared with one another in different ways, which are impossible with the other methods. Our method uses the polarization of the SAR images to obtain additional information for the purposes of the classification. The 3D DWT is used to extract the multiscale and multiorientational features from the polarimetric SAR image, and the Markov random field is used to model the spatial dependencies between the pixels and refine the results of the classification. Our results have been tested on the publicly available dataset and compared with other methods. The results have proved that our method achieves a significant improvement in the accuracy of the classification.",

Our method is able to be applied to a large variety of images, with a high resolution in the vertical dimension (as in satellite images), a low resolution in the horizontal dimension (as in still images), and with a mixture of both.",
    "This paper deals with the method of supermodular functions extended by slack and margin resizing, two useful methods for improving the performance of a linear algebra program. In particular, it shows that the method can be combined with other methods such as gradient descent, which achieves a higher convergence rate on certain practical problems. The results of this method are comparable with the results of the other methods, but it also has some advantages over them. First, it does not require special knowledge of the problem, and second, it can be used for the same problem. Third, it provides a simple way to implement the margin resizing method without a library. Finally, it is shown that the method has a good generality that can be applied to problems with different inputs.",
    "The problem posed here (the mapping of non-zero, n-dimensional real numbers into words) is quite different from most other common machine-learning problems. We could ask, for example, whether there is a mathematical representation of semantic relations that allows us to obtain a more precise picture of the semantic relationships among the objects of a language than can be obtained by other methods. Many efforts have been made to carry out linguistic analysis on data of the kind we propose. They usually involve searching large data bases with a combination of iterative and search methods such as linear models or tree-based methods (such as progressive or tree-progressive hybrids). In general, the structures extracted by these methods are quite context-dependent. The context cannot be captured by a mere distribution of word meanings, unless it includes a symbolic representation of the entire distribution of human behavior, be it in terms of things or of ideas (or both, depending on the context), such that the system itself would also reflect this representation. This approach is not only extremely complex, but also slow, since a large number of instances collected under varied conditions are needed to perform significant analysis. It should be noted that while our goal here is to obtain evaluations, this idea could be used for similar tasks of a somewhat similar nature, such as learning to classify text samples, feature generation, etc. We propose here a variant of this approach—namely, a two-stage procedure using sparse matrices and two hidden layers, based on a deep neural-network representation—and then compare its performance with two of the best current implementations: SVHN and its improved variant WordNet. The proposed method combines three novel, unrelated ideas: namely, a combination of hierarchical Bayesian modeling and sparse matrices without projections. Compared with existing methods, which need to be able to retrieve the entire set of examples to be used in learning, our results imply a much faster learning process, which might be useful for speech recognition tasks where we seek both high accuracy and speedup in taggers.",

    "The purpose of this study was to study brain segmentation potentials during cusum scanning using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and contrast MR data in a patient cohort with hippocampal damage caused by a stroke, by using T1-weighted imaging data. Three groups of subjects, having lesions of the anterior temporal lobe at the time of the initial examination, were subjected to two different scans 50 days apart. One scan was without a scan, one with an EPI cusum-tube, and one with a whole-head CT scan with the help of an artificial brain. During both scans T1-weighted images could be acquired, which may contribute to normal tissue preservation in the case of a brain injury, and the number and location of such areas was compared between the groups with different damage in the field of their examination. The result of this study can serve as a guide to the development of cusum-tubes with a high dynamic range, low signal attenuation, low noise and small spatial volumes. The brain segments produced by the SPM2 and 3 cusum-tubes can serve as a guide to the cognitive-neurological examination, and it may be possible to determine whether certain regions can be related before the pathological damage, such as a stroke, in patients with hippocampal damage caused by cortical injury.",

    "We develop a theoretical framework for the study of the effects of protein aggregation on the structure and thermodynamics of biological systems. Our approach is based on statistical mechanics of interacting particles, and we use it to study the formation of aggregates from proteins of different primary sequences. We find that the aggregation process is driven by the entropy of the system, and that the primary sequence of the constituent molecules plays a role in determining the size and shape of the aggregates. Also, the aggregation process is influenced by the presence of other types of molecules in the system, and the properties of the aggregates depend on the concentrations of the constituent molecules.",

    "Recently, the study of the semantic division of images and videos has seen great progress with the help of powerful deep learning neural networks. But most of these methods can only identify a single object class in an image or a frame of a video.

Our method is based on a new foreground clustering method that we call foreground-aware clustering, which can cluster foreground objects in an image or a frame of a video. In terms of their layout in the image. Then use the foreground objects to train a DNN for the task of joint localization and segmentation. We have evaluated our method on the difficult YouTube-Objects dataset, and the results are significantly better than the best joint localization and segmentation methods.",

    "This paper presents an automatic 3D cardiac image-based bi-ventricular segmentation approach based on a deep learning multi-task structure. Deep learning methods are increasingly being used in medical image analysis, where they have achieved a significant increase in efficiency and accuracy, but they have been plagued by the complex anatomical structure of the heart. The main objective of this paper is to enhance the precision and efficiency of image segmentation by developing and implementing a novel re-trained multi-tasked structure. This method, which uses sagittal, axial and sagittal planes simultaneously, takes advantage of local contextual information for better estimation, and also uses a shape refinement method for even greater precision. Through a deep analysis of the proposed method on various datasets, the superior performance of the proposed method is compared with that of previous methods. This robust method can substantially increase the trustworthiness and accuracy of the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac diseases.",

    "We present an analytic approach to the problem of matroid representability, a fundamental problem in combinatorics and algebraic geometry. Our approach is based on the study of k-independence of finite sets of vectors. We show a novel connection between the problem of matroid representability and the maximum distance separability problem. We prove a lower bound on the size of such sets and use this to establish new results on matroid representability. In particular, we prove that a matroid which can be represented over a finite field can also be represented over a sufficiently large finite field with a bounded number of elements. This result has important consequences for the study of matroids and their representations, and it gives a new perspective on the maximum distance separability problem. Using this analytic approach, we also study the behaviour of k-independence of finite sets of vectors as the size of the field increases. We show that the cardinality of such sets behaves in a surprisingly simple way which is closely related to the maximum distance separability conjecture, which gives new support to this conjecture and shows the power of the analytic approach to the problem of matroid representability. In this paper, we have developed a new perspective on the problems of matroid representability and maximum distance separability, and established a new analytic framework for further work in these areas.",
    "Clockwork convolutional neural networks are designed for the classification of videos and not for the classification of still images. They can take advantage of the temporal structure of the image, and be a much more efficient method of obtaining good results than convolutional neural networks. The outputs of the convolutional neural networks are then combined into a single segmentation mask, and the process is repeated for multiple frames, thus capturing the short-term and long-term temporal dependencies of the images in the video. The framework is evaluated on the cityscape, Pascal VOC, and Cocoa datasets, and significant improvements in segmentation accuracy are demonstrated. We also carry out a series of ablation experiments to investigate the effectiveness of different components of our framework and show that both the parallel and hierarchical processing of the frames contributes to improved performance. The main contributions of the paper are: The first is the proposed clockwork convolutional neural network. The second is the ablation experiment which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method. The third is the method of extracting information from the frames.",
    "The results of this study show that three-dimensional shape segmentation by means of a convolutional network of shapes of a simpler structure than the convolutional network of a convolutional net, is a method of obtaining data from raw data in a more convenient way. Our method uses the neural net for shape analysis, a three-dimensional convolutional net, a method that is fast, because it does not use the convolutional net, and this method yields three-dimensional shapes which are more precise and efficient than those obtained by the method of CFS or by means of the classical methods of vision. The proposed method uses a multi-scale method, where the convolutional net is trained at several scales and local and global features are learned at the same time., allowing the accurate division of three-dimensional shapes at different levels of detail. The results of this method are verified by evaluating it on various public point clouds, and it is found that this method can successfully divide the three-dimensional shapes with high precision and speed. We also show that SH-FCNs can be used in real time for a three-dimensional shape division in various applications, such as object recognition and scene understanding. Our method can be used in various fields, such as robots, driving, and design. The speed of three-dimensional shape division from raw point clouds will allow the recognition and understanding of objects, and three-dimensional shape division will speed up the division of objects.",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel method of semi-supervised 3D left atrium segmentation by means of an uncertainty-aware self-assembly model. Left atrial segmentation is a crucial step in many cardiac applications, such as atrial fibrillation detection and ablation plan. However, annotating the left atrium is a difficult task. The lack of sufficient labels may hamper the performance of supervised learning methods. To address this challenge, we propose a self-assembly model that combines multiple separate segmentation models to improve the accuracy and robustness of left atrial segmentation. Our method exploits the strengths of different models by aggregating their predictions and uncertainty estimates. Moreover, we introduce a novel uncertainty-aware self-assembly strategy that weights the contributions of different models based on their uncertainty in the result. We evaluate our method on a large dataset of cardiac magnetic resonance images, and compare its performance to that of the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. Our results show that our self-assembly model outperforms these methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. We also perform a series of experiments in order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty-aware self-assembly strategy and demonstrate its superiority over the existing methods. Our method has important implications for the development of semi-supervised learning methods for medical image segmentation, particularly for left atrium segmentation. The proposed uncertainty-aware self-assembly model can also be used in other medical image segmentation tasks where annotated data is scarce, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of the segmentation models in these settings.",
    "We prove that if X and Y are two real or complex Banach spaces, then there exists an angle $theta$ in the interval $[0, pi$ such that any linear operator $T$ between X and Y$ can be written as $T = U + V$, where U is unitary and V has a spectral radius no greater than $sin(frac12theta 2)$. This generalizes several known results in the literature. In particular, it implies that any continuous linear operator on a Hilbert space can be decomposed into a sum of a unitary operator and a compact one.",

We also propose a strategy of the weight between the edge loss and the background loss. The proposed edge loss is simple and effective. It is easy to combine with the existing semantic segmentation model. The experiments on three remote sensing images show that the proposed edge loss can improve the performance of semantic segmentation. The full text of the paper is available here.",

    "Abstract of the paper \"Attention U-net: learning where to look for the pancreas\": This paper proposes an attention mechanism for the U-net convolutional neural network used in medical image segmentation. The aim is to improve the performance of the U-net by adding spatial awareness and enabling the model to focus on the most relevant regions of the image. This is achieved by introducing an attention mechanism, which learns to determine the relative importance of each input feature map in the U-net encoding and decoding layers. This is achieved by predicting a weight map for each feature map, which is then used to scale the map before it is fed to the next layer. This enables the model to selectively attend to different regions of the image and adjust the weights of the input based on the relevance of each region to the task. The experiments on several data sets show significant improvements in accuracy and speed compared to the U-net without attention. The attention mechanism improves the performance of the model by enabling it to focus on the most relevant regions of the image. The attention mechanism is therefore a useful tool for medical image analysis and can be applied to many other tasks in image analysis.",
    "In recent years, a considerable amount of interest has been taken in modifying the deep-learning models to improve the performance. But training and obtaining an efficient self-organizing method for medical image processing is a formidable task due to its size and complexity. The goal of the present paper is to propose an uncertainty-aware self-organizing model that can be applied to segment left atriums from CT volumes with the limited or defective labeling commonly encountered in clinical practice, without sacrificing robustness and efficiency. Our method combines unlabeled data with partially labeled data to learn both spatial relationships among points in the same organ and the relationships between organs. The proposed method consists of three main components: (i) a series of convolutional neural networks (NNs); (ii) a graph neural network for intermediate output processing; and (iii) a loss function which takes into account the output uncertainty and the smoothness of the outputs in order to balance high flexibility and stability. The results of experiments on two publicly available datasets show that our proposed method achieves comparable results to the best supervised methods with significantly greater robustness, efficiency, and scalability, despite limited or missing data. Furthermore, it provides additional uncertainty estimates, which can be used as a valuable clinical metric. The proposed method is thus very promising in reducing the computational cost and achieving accurate results in a practical environment where semi-supervised learning is more and more important.",
    "These field-induced atoms, where the internal oscillations of the atoms are induced by external electric fields, have been studied in terms of structure evolution and dynamics. The studied structures were changed by pulses of electric fields with a frequency ranging from 1015 hz to 1THz, depending on the atoms in question and their state of charge. We hereby report the structure-changing observations made using X-ray diffraction under room temperature conditions, where a pulsed electric field of up to 100 kV/cm in z-z-directions was applied along the normal to the sample surface, with each pulse causing a formation of new phases, which could be identified by their diffraction patterns. We may find that it will lead us to some unexpected destination.",
    "In this article we study the Morse-Gell-man boundaries in proper geodesic metric spaces. It is proved that they are compact. We construct an explicit example of a noncompact boundary which is not cut at infinity and also does not satisfy any of the known conditions on the asymptotic behaviour of a boundary, such as Gromov hyperbolicity or finite Hausdorff dimension. See the second theorem below, where these properties fail even though there is some point which satisfies all three of these criteria at the same time. This is evidence against the third conjecture of Minsky [3,4]. This gives rise to questions about the uniqueness of some relationships, which depend only on the time reversal symmetry, and are thus broken down completely in certain classes of manifolds, such as Lorentzian manifolds.",
    "Some non-uniform, inhomogeneous noise is also common in practical applications. Taking this into account, a novel image-segmentation method is proposed. It is based on the KL divergence of the Finite Element Method and morphological reconstruction. The two popular image analysis methods, image regularization and wavelet decomposition, are combined. KL divergence is one of the most widely used methods of regularization because it produces the best results in many clustering problems. We use the morphological reconstruction method to smooth the original image based on a Gaussian kernel and morphological opening operations. Using the morphological wavelet decomposition, we pre-process the smoothed image, namely, the smoothed image is decomposed into a set of sub-images, each of which has a different scale, or a set of sub-images for each scale of the frequency spectrum. Then we combine the wavelet and morphological decompositions with the Finite Element Method to obtain a mask for the segmentation. According to the experimental results and analysis, the proposed method gives good results and can be used to segment various types of images.",

This interval can be useful in comparing different experimental conditions, or in making future predictions on the basis of previous data gathered in similar conditions.",

The Doctor and his companions have to fight off the invasion while also trying to find out what’s become of Ace. This summary is not available anywhere else on the web, but it’s clearly been written by someone familiar with the book and seems to fit the cover illustration. I’m assuming the person who wrote this summary was either a fan or someone who’d read the book. I don’t know whether the person who wrote this summary knew about the book’s connection to the BBC series, but it’s unlikely that someone who’d been involved with the production of the book could have missed something so obvious. So why did this summary get published? Well, there are two possibilities. One is that the person who published it didn’t know about the book’s connection to the series, and therefore didn’t mention the fact that the book was based on the series. The second is that the person who published it knew about the connection but chose to publish it anyway, because he wanted to promote the book. Anyway, this summary shouldn’t have been published.",
    "The story of Toby begins in April, ’87, when he is kidnapped by two children, Michael and his friend Toby. They have stolen an old school bus to kidnap the next victim with, and drive it hitchhiking to Ohio, where they intend to eat him, after first killing someone with a chainsaw. Meeting at the local Taco Bell, they are picked up by a man called Ewing, who takes them to a town called Ramona, where they appear to be welcome, until the kidnappers decide to kill everyone. Then they make Mr. Ewing pay by eating him. This film seems to be the sequel to The Lonely Hearts Club, and I’ll just quote the worst of it, to give an idea why it’s a waste of time: What makes it so bad is the way Arnold portrays the child’s love of death and violence, in order to give the impression that it’s still a film about a child. There were no scenes showing the death, or the aftermath of the murder—which is probably why no one would have thought anything wrong with this story. The worst of it was in the way it portrayed the horror of being killed, and how excited the children were about the idea of murder. But now, in the twenty-first century, when people watch films made in the late seventies and early eighties, from when I was little, it’s shocking to read the kind of things that were unthinkable a few decades ago. Reading bad fan-fics about children doing nasty things to each other, one might assume that it’s possible for anyone to write a story like this, but actually, no. Of course, if you like your slasher films, you’ll probably hate this one. It’s not like the rest, and involves weird stuff. However, my opinion of it back then was far more favourable, because it wasn’t meant for children but for adults going through the same experiences with a child! At least, that was the point. Besides, you won’t find much about children in the fictional world that doesn’t involve either horror or fantasy.",

    "Then, on the other hand, the Oxford under-grad, Peter Quince, is sent by his tutor to Pym’s cottage, in order to study. He comes of a poor family, but he is a pretty boy, and is destined to do well at his examinations, if he can only avoid the distractions of college life. His tutor hopes that by separating him from his fellow-pupils, he will find it easier to attend to his studies. Pym soon discovers a box of letters, containing a note asking him to engage a young man to come and be his tutor. Being little in contact with any of his fellow-men since the time of his enforced retreat from the world, he feels as though he were chosen expressly for the purpose. And when the young man arrives a few weeks later, he is disappointed, because he finds the young man not his intellectual equal, nor his companion in fun. And yet he, like Quince himself, is attracted by the new arrival, and their conversations grow longer and more intimate as the months pass. They come to talk of more and more personal matters, and Pym is able to discuss with Quince what is troubling him. In short, a young man has been engaged by a recluse, by a series of correspondence which he has chanced to intercept, to teach him the art of being afraid. The only way that he can ever achieve the greatness that he wishes to attain in life, is to learn to be afraid of the things that other men naturally fear. And here is the trouble with the matter: how can one, who is unable to be afraid as others are, expect to be able to ‘tread where others dare not’, as the book’s title also puts it? Or could one? Would you be able to live in the world if you were unable to experience the emotions that others experience, the emotions which make up the human condition? Or would you? How would you be able to understand other people, when they were able to experience things which you could not experience? The things that make you human – or in this case, would they actually make you less human?",

    "Lester Karp wanted to escape his suburban existence and to establish himself by returning to his childhood joys. The first thing he did was to enroll in a seminar on American literature at a nearby college. But the seminar is really just an excuse for the professor to push his personal taste. Therefore, Karp had to rely on Gus Doyle, his old childhood friend, a brilliant graduate student who also reads and discusses literature with him. Both men want to be writers.

    "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to announce the date of the next general election in his speech today. For weeks there has been speculation as to when the ten-year incumbent would call a general election. The announcement coincides with a sharp decline in the popularity of Tony Blair. Many politicians are convinced that Mr. Blair wants to regain momentum and hope to win a new and strong mandate from the people. However, the increasing popularity of the opposition parties and the criticisms within his own party have left the outcome of the upcoming election uncertain. The fact that Mr. Blair is announcing the date now is an indication that he is now able to present his achievements in office. In a way, it is a strategic move that allows Mr. Blair to steer the agenda, directing public attention away from the controversies that have recently dominated the debate and towards the policy and plans of the Labour Party. The announcement of the date means that the campaign will be intensified as the party leaders and candidates step up their efforts to influence the voters. The outcome of the election will not only determine the future of the Labour Party, but will also have an important impact on the country's course for the next few years. With the ongoing Brexit negotiations and a wide range of domestic issues, the stakes are high. The election countdown will now begin, and the British public will listen to Tony Blair as he outlines his vision of the future and seeks to convince the electorate to give him a new mandate.",
    "Illva Saronno, the Italian producer of Disaronno liqueur, is negotiating to buy into a Chinese winery, as it tries to cash in on China’s growing wine market. As China’s middle classes grow and their taste for Western products, including wine, becomes stronger, the Illva Saronno Company, which has a liqueur factory in Italy, is trying to make inroads into China’s burgeoning wine market. The winery in question is the Changyu, one of the oldest in China, which dates back to 1892. It has been expanding in recent years, acquiring vineyards in France, Spain and Australia. In recent years, China has become one of the world’s largest wine consumers, and the market is expected to grow further. The growing numbers of China’s middle classes—estimated at 400 million—have a growing taste for wine, especially imported varieties. This has created a new opportunity for foreign wine producers, and Illva Saronno’s investment in Changyu would be a way of entering the Chinese wine market. Also, it would give Changyu access to Illva Saronno’s international network of wine importers and to the company’s experience in the wine industry. The news comes as other international wine producers are also entering China’s wine market. Mot Hennessy has recently announced that it is to establish a vineyard in the Ningxia province of China, which has excellent conditions for the growing of grapes. The Australian Treasury Wine Estates has been steadily increasing its holdings in China, with a special emphasis on prestigious wine brands. Despite these moves, the Chinese wine industry is still young and faces competition from both domestic and foreign producers. Furthermore, there are cultural differences in the preferences of consumers and the habits of consumption. However, the potential of the Chinese wine market, especially with its growing middle classes, is considerable.",
    "\"Edwards Jr., did not put out the idea of a law to arrest an anonymous and secret benefactor.\" Megan Fox, former actress in the Trans-formers, has made a substantial donation to the repair of the Chinese Theater in Los Angeles. The iconic theater, which was built in 1927, has hosted many premieres, is known for its luxurious design and the famous hand and foot prints in the cement courtyard. The bid to save the theater came as a relief to many residents and film fans who were worried about the future of the iconic cinema. The theater has recently been threatened by financial difficulties and the impact of the influenza epidemic of Covd-19, which forced the closure of many places of entertainment. Megan Fox's contribution to the restoration of the theater has brought hope to the community and to the film industry. Her contribution will not only preserve the history of the theater but also allow modern changes to be made to the building and, as a result, improve the cinema's experience. The news of the philanthropic initiative of Megan Fox has been praised and widely acknowledged. Many have praised the actress for using her influence and wealth to support and preserve a cultural site that has such a strong connection to the history of film. As a result of her commitment to the arts and culture, she is now being hailed as both a star in Hollywood and a defender of the arts. With the ongoing discussion and plans for the restoration, it is unclear how the project will progress. However, with the support of a high-profile celebrity such as Megan Fox, the preservation of cultural heritage has been given more attention. It is also a reminder of the role that celebrities can play in championing causes they care about. Megan Fox's love of film and her loyalty to the legacy of the cinema in Los Angeles has inspired her to act, and her contribution will have a long-lasting effect on the local community and the film industry. The restoration will undoubtedly bring the iconic theater back to life, and Megan Fox's contribution will undoubtedly be remembered as a watershed moment in the theater's history. Her support will not only save a well-known landmark but also remind people of the importance of preserving cultural heritage for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.",
    "At the same time, we are talking to ballet companies. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which still continues to attack the theatres, the world of dance is experiencing a long period of uncertainty. With the theatres closed and the cancelled performances, dancers and choreographers are in a limbo, unable to work and not knowing when they will be able to appear on stage again. The impact of the pandemic on the finances of the world of dance has been particularly severe. Many of them rely on ticket sales and donations to maintain themselves. With the performance cancelled, the sources of income have dried up, the result being that employees and dancers have been dismissed, leaving them with few means to live on. In addition to the difficulties of survival, the pandemic has also hampered the training and development of the ballets. With the studios closed and the lessons withdrawn, the dancers have had to find an alternative to keep in shape and maintain their technique. Some of them have turned to virtual lessons and virtual rehearsing, but this is not the same as being in the studio with the other dancers and the teachers. Moreover, the lack of opportunity to dance has left the dancers feeling estranged and depleted. The ballet is a collective art form, and the cancellation of the performances has meant that the dancers are deprived of the opportunity to share their art with an audience and receive the immediate gratification and approval that comes from performing. There are also concerns about the long-term impact of the pandemic on the world of dance. Theatres are closed, and audiences are reluctant to return to crowded venues. So it is not known when the ballet companies will be able to resume their regular performance. In this uncertainty, there is a fear that the companies may not survive the crisis and may have to close their doors. But the world of dance has been resilient and determined to find new ways to survive. Several companies have tried new ways of connecting with the audience, for example through live broadcasting or public performances. The dancers have also taken advantage of this period of uncertainty to develop new creative projects and to undertake new collaborations. But the road to recovery is not easy. And in order to survive and continue to offer the world the beauty and artistry of the ballet, they need continued support from governments, philanthropists and audiences. Only the future will tell what will become of the ballet. One thing is certain, however: that, despite the uncertainty, the passion and devotion of the dancers and the whole dance world will not be shaken.",

    "TONY BLAIR will announce a general election for December this week, a decision that will immediately provoke a wave of criticism that he is putting the country’s economic recovery at risk for political gain. The Prime Minister will set the stage for a high-voltage election campaign with a statement of a December 10 vote, part of a strategy to overcome the Conservatives’ long-established advantage on trust. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Mr Blair conceded that the decision would delay decisions on taxes, but argued that it would be better to make them in the new year with a new government. “I think it’s right to take those decisions with a new government after the election,” he said. “You don’t want to take such a momentous decision when you are about to have an election.” The Prime Minister denied that the decision to call the election now, rather than waiting until the spring, was a political calculation. “I don’t think it’s right to call an election for purely political reasons. You do it when you think it’s the right thing to do,” he said. “So when you ask, ‘Is it better to have an election before you take a decision on, say, taxation,’ my view is that it is.” “It’s very difficult to introduce tax rises before an election,” he said, because the Conservatives would say: “You are doing this for political reasons.” It was “very difficult for me to do it.” His comments will increase speculation that he is preparing to postpone until after the election the need for a tough new approach to taxation, despite his earlier assurances that he would not delay decisions. Last week the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, was under pressure to abolish the five per cent income tax band after a budget office estimated it was costing the Exchequer £1.3 billion. The Prime Minister said he wanted to serve out his second term, despite previous indications that he would stand down after 2010. “I want to see it through, and I think it’s important for the country that the government does see it through,” he said. Mr Blair denied that the election would distract the Government from its battle against terrorism, although some ministers have warned that it would.",
    "The Illva Saronno Company of Italy, which is famous for its liqueur Disaronno, has bought a ten per cent interest in the Grace Company of China, the Italian press has reported. The Chinese media report that the company will acquire a ten per cent stake for an undisclosed sum, but we are led to believe it will be about ten million dollars (about 7.2 million pounds). The agreement comes at a time when China and Italy are looking to expand their commercial ties. In fact, the Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, was the first foreign leader to visit China after the outbreak of a deadly virus, the coronavirus, and it was announced after their meeting that the two countries had signed a “cooperation agreement” in which China promised to purchase more Italian products, including wine. The Grace Company was founded in 1997 by the Chinese actress Grace Quo, who is still the chairperson of the company. The company is based in Shandong Province, in the country’s northeast, and makes red, white and sparkling wine under several different brands, as well as a line of “healthy” wines.",
    "The film star who played the part of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz is one of the bidders for a London theatre, the BBC has learned. Neil Fox, who starred in the film of Bugsy Malone, is one of the anonymous members of a group that has bid for the Hackney Empire Theatre. The theater’s board of directors would accept the offer, if it could identify the bidders. The Hackney Empire Theatre Trust has been trying to raise £1.3m since April to buy the theatre from its present owners, CT Estates, which put up the money for the £25m restoration. However, CT Estates has said it cannot afford to run the theater. In a statement to the BBC, Mr Fox said he was offering the money because he felt the theater should be available for local people and for theater lovers everywhere. He said he had formed several companies with “business associates” who were able to offer the money. “We are all very keen on the theatre and we feel our offer should at least be considered by the board,” he said. “I find it extraordinary that they should dismiss the offer out of hand just because we have decided to remain anonymous. “We have nothing to hide and our offer is genuine.” In The Wiz, a musical version of The Wizard of Oz, Mr Fox played the role of Dorothy, opposite singer Michael Jackson, who played the Scarecrow. He also starred in Bedknobs and Chaise-Leger for the BBC and Magic Moments for ITV.",
    "The future of one of the oldest ballet companies in England is in jeopardy, due to lack of support from the public and the deterioration of financial conditions. The Birmingham Royal Ballet has asked the city council for an emergency loan of £1.8 million. The company has cancelled this year's Nutcracker performance and is considering dismissing up to half of its 200 dancers. The board of trustees is expected to meet with the company's directors on Friday to discuss the loan request. The ballet company, based at the Birmingham Hippodrome, has suffered a significant drop in the number of visitors, and has been forced to sell its headquarters in the suburban area of Perry Barr. In February, it was announced that the ballet company's chief executive, David Paltenghi, was leaving after serving for 14 years. At the time, Paltenghi said that the company's finances were \"stable\", but that the economic situation was \"uncertain.\"",

And yesterday the chancellor, Gordon Brown, won a token vote of confidence from his colleagues after it was alleged that he had sought to undermine Tony Blair.

    "Kweichow-Moutai, the leading brand of China's wine and liquors, has signed a contract with Illva Saronno, one of Italy's oldest and largest liquor companies, to distribute its products in Italy. The two companies will also be able to \"strengthen the presence of both companies in their home countries, and explore the development of business in other countries.\" The liquor company, whose fiery spirit is a favorite of China's ruling party, has been expanding its overseas business. Although its sales have declined recently in China, because of the decline in the consumption of baijiu among the young generation, because they are drinking more and more imported spirits, such as Scotch whiskey, the company's sales in China rose by 27% in the first half of this year, and he hopes to win more new consumers in Europe and other places. Chinese beverage companies are trying to go abroad, because domestic alcohol consumption is slowing down, and the export of Chinese liquor, wine, and beer is growing rapidly. The new Budweiser-Tsingtao Beer Co., which was established by the combination of the former Budweiser and the current Tsingtao Beer, said it will enter the world's top 10 beer companies within 10 years.

    "Italy have many reasons to be optimistic when they face England on Saturday in the quarter-final of the European Championship. They have a fully fit team to choose from and they are still smarting from the 2-1 win over the powerful Belgians in the last sixteen. And as manager Roberto Mancini recalled on the eve of the game, his team has another important weapon: the set pieces. They scored their first goal against Belgium with a fantastic free kick by Leonardo Spinazzola just before half time to stun the noisy crowd in Rome. England have a weakness against set pieces, as they proved in their tight 2-1 win over Germany in the last sixteen. “We have some tools in this area, and we have prepared well, because England are strong physically and attack a lot from set pieces,” Mancini said. Italy may have spent long periods on the back foot against Belgium, but they had more of the play, and they should have been a couple up by the time Spinazzola struck. Mancini’s men will be much more assertive against England, especially in the first half, and they have the tools to cause Gareth Southgate’s team problems. Italy have many tall players, but their best attacking weapon is the intelligence and movement of their striker Ciro Immobile. He does not just stand in the centre of the penalty area and wait for the ball to come to him, he rather moves around to press the defence into mistakes in dangerous areas. His flick on Marco Verratti’s cross nearly gave Italy the lead against Belgium, and he has earned a goal for his hard work in the group games. He will probably be the key player for Italy on Saturday. Immobile, who turns thirty in December, is very mobile and can find space, either with his back to goal or when he is able to go past his marker. He will try to latch on to the crosses that Italy will undoubtedly send in.",

    "The Scottish Football Association yesterday made the bold claim that his country can go all the way in the World Cup, provided that his players are willing to play for Ireland without fear, something that the FAI has never allowed before when selecting the team. “We can, if the Irish players are willing to get up and play for Ireland without fear,” said Togus Finnan, Assistant Secretary and a member of the Scottish FA’s Governing Body. “That’s all it takes to go to the World Cup; that’s all we lack.” We can go to the World Cup; it won’t be a problem. If we win the group and play well, we can win the tournament. We have four games left, and we can do it.” Finnan’s comments were met with a considerable round of applause from the other representatives in the room at St. James’s Park. As for who he believes will play in Brazil, he wouldn’t say.

    "Japan's economy contracted in the third quarter, the government announced on Friday, due to a decline in exports and a fall in domestic demand. The economy contracted 0.2% in the third quarter of this year, which is the biggest contraction since the third quarter of 2009, when the economy contracted 0.3%. The fall was caused by a 0.2% drop in industrial production. The government forecasts the economy to grow 0.6% annually during the current fiscal year, which ends in March. This is an increase of 0.2% from its previous forecast. The government is trying to boost the economy by cutting taxes and increasing spending. The government is also hoping to raise domestic demand by increasing the consumption tax from 8% to 8%. Besides, the government wants to raise the consumption tax to 8% from 5%.

    "Despite a drop in European Ford production of nearly a quarter, the American giant still says it will show a profit for the year. Ford Europe president Nick Scheele said the company's operating losses were \"more than offset\" by good results from its American finance arm. \"This year we're showing a profit, and we've experienced a very large drop in production,\" he told the BBC. Last year Ford Europe lost $254m (£130m). \"We're expecting to show a profit this year, thanks to a very strong performance from our financial division in North America.\" Ford's finance division has been helped by low interest rates in the US, which has meant it has been able to offer cheap loans. Ford has also benefited from the recent devaluation of the euro against the dollar. In spite of all the problems the European car industry faces, Mr Scheele is confident that Ford will maintain its market share in the region. \"We will do that by continuing to develop new products, continuing to reduce our costs and continuing to invest in our brands,\" he said. \"We think that's the right strategy, and we're beginning to see the results.\"",
    "Former British Foreign Secretary William Hague has allegedly earned a six-figure income from his positions outside of Parliament, as documents leaked by a financial intermediary reveal. The documents show that Mr. Hague earned a considerable sum as a public speaker, author and consultant, in addition to the parliamentary pension he receives for his years as a member of Parliament and minister. Since 1997, the Conservative Party leader and the Foreign Secretary, he has been a key figure in British politics for several decades. Since he left the Foreign Office in 2014, he has been paid quite well in the private sector. The financial documents indicate that Mr. Hague has earned more than 800,000 pounds from his speeches alone. The Washington Speakers Bureau, which represents him, also represents former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. In addition to his public speeches, Mr. Hague has also earned a lot as an author, as his books on William Pitt the Younger and William Wilberforce have been enthusiastically received and have contributed to his wealth. Furthermore, Mr. Hague has acted as a consultant for several major companies. The reported advisory services allegedly also earned him a six-figure sum. The publication of the financial documents has caused some criticism of Mr. Hague. Opponents argue that it is wrong for former politicians to earn such high salaries from the private sector, especially while continuing to receive a parliamentary salary. Supporters of Mr. Hague, however, claim that he is allowed to lead a career outside of politics and that his earnings reflect his skills and experience.",
    "Tuscan aristocracy, which has been attracted to the Chinese wine market by the rapid growth of the Chinese middle class, is to be convinced of the opportunities for world-wide growth, which may be opened up in China. Ilva Saronno, a manufacturer of Disaronno and Tia Maria, is now in negotiations with Chinese winemakers and wine-importers, in view of increasing the commercial and cultural turnover. According to the Vinexpo report, China will be the world's second largest wine market in 2020, worth $ 23 billion. Ilva's interest in China is understandable. The company, which is already well represented in Europe and North America, is looking for new markets and China, with its huge market and growing interest in wine, is a tempting opportunity. But the entry into the Chinese market is not easy. Ilva will have to cope with complex regulations, high import tariffs and fierce competition from both local and foreign producers. Moreover, Chinese consumers' wine preferences are still changing, and it is not yet known if they will ever take a liking to the products of Ilva Saronno. However, Ilva seems to be unperturbed by these difficulties. The company's management is confident that its high-quality products, combined with a strategic market entry, will open up a niche in the Chinese wine market. Ilva's interest in China reflects the larger trend in the wine industry. Having saturated the market in Europe and North America, wine producers are looking for opportunities in new, emerging markets, such as China. Ilva's success in China may well be a precedent for other Western winemakers to enter the Chinese market. Ilva has not yet set a date for the launch of its business in China. However, wine industry experts are expecting Ilva to make a move sooner rather than later, given the rapid growth of the Chinese wine market.",
    "Star of the screen, Fox, announces a new venture in the field of theater. The beloved star of the screen, the d'Orsay, becomes the latest Tinseltown to take an interest in the local theater, announcing the support of a London project to develop the best theater in the West End. The project also includes the establishment of an academy of performance for future artists. Speaking at a press conference held on the spot, d'Orsay called the project \"a labor of love\": “Theater is the birthplace of all actors and remains a unique place of storytelling. With this project, I hope to give back to the industry that has done so much for me. ” Born in the theater, d'Orsay honed his talents on the big screen with a series of critically acclaimed performances in a career spanning three decades. But the origins of the star lie in the theater, which is why this new endeavor is an important milestone in his illustrious career. Support for the project has already poured in from leading figures in the field of culture and from a receptive audience. British director Danny Boyle called the plans \"a great way to revive the classics and give a push to young talent\". The details of the first production of the theater are still a secret, but the project is bound to have a great effect on the industry. Although the pandemic has seriously damaged the theaters worldwide, the industry has proved that it is strong and has the ability to return and contribute to the UK's cultural landscape. With the London Theater being developed by d'Orsay, the theater expects to open in 2022, which would start a new chapter of theater in the West End. With the support of a film star like d'Orsay, the British theater is likely to be better than ever.",
    "Future of the ballet, which the pandemic is putting to severe strain, is being called in question. Ballet companies are struggling with financial losses, cancelled performances, and the problem of maintaining a high standard of training during a period of mass disinfection. Similarly to other companies, the Royal Ballet has had to send its staff and dancers home, causing great concern for the future of the profession. A time of worry for all those involved in the ballet. The physical demands of ballet, which require high fitness and flexibility, are only one aspect of the difficulties. During the period of mass disinfection, training centres have been closed, and the rescheduling of classes has caused many dancers difficulties in maintaining their physical condition. ‘Dancing at home isn’t the same as dancing at the school,’ said Maria, a dancer with the English National Ballet. ‘We don’t have the space, or the right flooring.’ ‘It’s hard to keep up the intensity.’ The pandemic has also had a negative effect on the careers of many young dancers. Schools have been closed, auditions cancelled, and opportunities for young dancers to gain experience have been limited. “The future of the ballet is at stake,” said Dame Darcey Bussell, former principal dancer with the Royal Ballet. ‘We need to do everything we can to support our dancers financially and emotionally so that the art form can survive this difficult time.’ But there is some hope. Some companies have been able to perform in cyberspace, reaching new audiences and making some money. The Royal Ballet’s webcast of The Nutcracker has been seen by more than a million people all over the world. ‘We are experimenting and innovating,’ said Kevin O’Hare, director of the Royal Ballet. ‘We are finding new ways to connect with our audiences and to keep the ballet alive.’ In spite of these efforts, the future of the ballet is still uncertain. If the pandemic continues, the industry will have to find new ways to survive and to flourish, in a world where performances are not possible for a long time. ‘This is uncharted territory,’ said Dame Darcey. ‘But the ballet has survived wars, economic downturns and other crises. It is resilient, and it will survive.’",
    "In an unexpected development, the Ford Motor Company is currently doing better because of its financing department than because of its manufacturing department. According to the latest financial statements, Ford Credit has seen its profits soar in the wake of a chip shortage affecting car manufacturing. Ford’s own selling of cars has suffered a major setback because of the chip shortage. The rise in the profits of the Ford Credit department, however, has helped to compensate to some extent. The Ford Credit department offers dealers and buyers a variety of financial products, such as wholesale inventory financing and retail installment contracts for the purchase of new and used vehicles. The current market situation has clearly benefited this department. It also has benefited from the low interest rates in the past year, which have encouraged the car dealers to finance more of the purchases of their buyers. According to the most recent quarterly report of Ford, the finance department has made a profit of $1.6 billion before taxes, thus contributing a substantial part of the company’s overall earnings. This is a sharp contrast to the relatively modest profit of $533 million made by the automobile division in the same quarter. However, although the company’s structure is skewed towards manufacturing, the high profits of the finance department are not entirely unexpected in the auto industry. Generally speaking, the financing department of car manufacturers has proved a more consistent source of profit than the selling of automobiles. “In a sense, these figures show how much the financial problems of Ford and the other automakers are exacerbated by their supply-chain issues,” says an analyst at Edmunds.com. “But they also highlight the strategic importance of diversified sources of revenue.” The Ford management appears to agree. The company’s CFO, John Lawler, is quoted in a statement saying that the Ford Credit team is performing exceptionally well, even in the current difficult used-car market. The good financial figures, however, are a mixed blessing for Ford, which has to weigh its car-making operations against the profits of its finance department. Moreover, the current chip shortage is expected to persist, posing a continuing challenge to the car-making operations of Ford and other manufacturers. In the end, the Ford division is suffering from the chip shortage, but the company’s profits are soaring because of its financing department, which has proved a blessing in disguise in this difficult time. This situation also underscores the strategic importance of integrated business models, which combine the production of cars with other sources of revenue.",

Tim, who retired from the professional tour in 2007, has joined the BBC's commentating team for the coming grass-court season, and his debut was met with admiration. “I have always been passionate about tennis, and I hope to bring that passion to my commentary.” Henman's first assignment was to commentate on the opening day of the Fever-Tree Championships at the Queen's Club, where he covered a number of matches, including the match between defending champion Feliciano Lopez and the rising Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas. Tim showed a keen eye for detail, spotting and pointing out subtle aspects of the players' games that other commentators might have missed. He also had a knack for explaining complex tactics and strategies in a simple manner that was very well received by tennis fans, who praised him for making tennis more accessible and enjoyable to understand. One viewer took to social media to say: Henman's commentary is a revelation, he's making me look at tennis in a totally different light.” Tim's colleagues in the commentary box also praised his style of commentary. The seasoned commentator John Lloyd said: “Tim is a very good addition to the team. He's got a great knowledge of the game, and he has a way of imparting that knowledge in a way that's interesting and informative.” The BBC's decision to bring Henman on board has been widely praised.",
    "China's dairy industry is under investigation, according to a BBC report. Four officials of the Sanlu Group, China's largest dairy producer, were detained on Thursday, according to the report. The company was involved in a milk scandal in which thousands of children fell ill and caused great anxiety among consumers. Sanlu was accused of deliberately selling milk powder contaminated with melamine to make it appear to have a higher content of milk. The company has denied the accusations and recalled all its milk powder products from stores all over China. The food safety scandal has sparked public anger and calls for stricter food control. Parents of sick children protested in front of the company's offices in Beijing and demanded compensation and redress. Critics also blamed the Chinese government for being slow to respond. The government has promised to crack down on food safety lapses and is launching a nationwide investigation into the dairy industry. The detention of the four Sanlu officials is seen by some as a token punishment, and they are calling for more comprehensive reform of China's food control system. The scandal has raised concern about China's exports. Some countries have recalled Chinese milk products from their markets. The European Union has banned all Chinese dairy products from its market. The US has issued a warning against buying Chinese infant formula. The blame for the food safety lapses has been placed on lax food safety regulations and corruption in the industry.",

The decision was welcomed by politicians and trade union leaders, who praised Sainsbury for its initiative to support the democratic process. “This is a wonderful example of a responsible employer putting the interests of its employees first,” said Rachel Reeves, Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee. “It is crucial that everyone has the chance to vote and have their say in the future of this country.” Tim Roache, General Secretary of the GMB, said: “This is a great decision by Sainsbury and one that we hope other companies will follow. It is important that everyone has the opportunity to vote and we are delighted that Sainsbury has taken this step.” According to reports, a number of other large companies are considering following Sainsbury’s example and giving their employees the same privilege. In addition, the government has promised to try out new voting methods, including the possibility of registering to vote on the Internet. Some commentators have raised the question of whether this could give a boost to certain parties and candidates, but most people agree that anything that makes it easier for people to vote can only be a good thing for democracy.",
    "Scotland coach Gregor Townsend named a squad of thirty-one for the forthcoming Six Nations, with the return from injury of Zander Fagerson, prop, and of back-rower, Jamie Ritchie, of Edinburgh. Fagerson missed last year's tournament with injury, while Ritchie was out after a concussion in November.

    "The nineties were the heyday of some of the greatest retro-gaming platforms: the Super NES, the Mega Drive, the Playstation, and the Sega Game Gear. But with the arrival of the Internet, mobile phones, the Nintendo 3DS, and other systems, the era of playing only on one device might be at an end. Some studios are taking advantage of the new era to create remastered versions of old classics. Others are even releasing new games that look like retro classics. One of these games is Metal Slug 2. On first glance, it might look like the sequel to the original Metal Slug released in the nineties. But this isn’t the case. It’s actually a new Metal Slug game, but this time in two dimensions instead of three. The two-dimensional Metal Slug is very enjoyable, especially if you like games with a side-scrolling, action-shooter formula. It’s also a good attempt at recreating the classic Metal Slug games and other classics in the run-and-gun genre. The game has a single-player and a co-op mode, so if you have a PS4, you can play with others and also, if you want, against strangers on the Internet. The levels are excellent. You can scroll the screen in the classic side-scrolling style, but instead of moving back and forth horizontally, your character can also jump up and down. This makes the game much more interesting because you often have to jump to reach the next enemy or location, and sometimes the best route isn’t immediately obvious. The game’s level design is varied and the action is fun. However, the game also has its downsides. First, as in many classic run-and-gun games, you can die in one hit. There is no way to save your progress and no checkpoints that I could see. Levels also have a very strict time limit, which is quite annoying.",
    "The European Union has agreed to an increase in its budget for development aid, which is to increase by 50 percent in seven years. In 2013 it would amount to 72 billions instead of 48 billion. Some countries are anxious about this and may not meet the agreed objectives. Development organizations welcomed this increase, but said it was still far from what rich countries should give. The European Union already spends more than any other donor community on international development assistance, but Britain points out that the figure also includes the costs of peacekeeping missions and debt relief. Also, the United States is giving far more to the world than the European Union. Under the new agreement, each member state will give a gross development assistance of.56 percent of its income in 2010, which will increase to.70 percent in 2015. This goal was set in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in the year 2000, when world leaders vowed to halve poverty in the world by 2015. Several countries are already achieving these goals and surpassing them; Sweden, Denmark and Luxembourg already give.9 percent. Others, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain, fall short of the existing goal of.56 percent, according to Oxfam International. Germany, France and Italy are also falling behind, and Britain is doing.56 percent, but is unlikely to reach the higher target because of the reconstruction in Iraq and the cost of the war on terrorism. Foreign Minister Jack Straw has said he believes Britain can meet the goal if it is not drawn into any more military ventures, and added that the UK is committed to meeting the.56 percent target. “We believe we can do this without having to increase taxes,” he said. Straw suggested that the UK might use part of its 10 billion surplus to help meet the increased commitment. Various possibilities were also mentioned, such as giving up tax incentives for corporations and rich individuals.",
    "Microsoft has released 15 patches, including a number of critical fixes that are required to be installed urgently. The most serious bugs were in Windows, Adobe Shockwave and the Sun Java Runtime Environment. This month's Patch Tuesday is one of the biggest since the beginning of the year. Some of the problems are already being exploited, according to the software giant. Attackers have recently attacked the Bank of Korea with the help of one of the bugs. Security experts and hackers have been warned in advance by the software giant. Another of the critical fixes was for a zero-day vulnerability in Java, which could be used by attackers to gain full control over a victim's computer using a variety of attack methods. The bug in question is one of the first to be included in the new bug-fix program by Oracle, and the company had already announced that the fix would be issued next week. The Adobe Shockwave bug is more difficult to exploit, but could allow remote attackers to compromise a victim's computer with just one visit to a malicious site. Today's release fixes the bug, according to the company. In addition, five bugs were found in the most popular Windows operating system. Two are classified as critical, which means they are a high-priority risk for the security of your PC, while the other three are rated important. Seven of the 15 patches released on Tuesday affected the tools that come in the box with the most popular versions of the operating system. The seven bugs were rated as critical by Microsoft, while the remaining eight were rated as important, which means that they are less serious, but still require attention. In addition to the 15 official patches, an emergency patch was also released Tuesday, blocking an attack reported by the German company SAP earlier this week. The vulnerability, which has never been publicly disclosed, allows the attackers to take over the affected computers with just one request.",
    "The home secretary, Charles Clarke, has been subjected to a revolt on the proposed introduction of national identity cards. The proposal, which would force all citizens of the United Kingdom to carry a personal identification document, has been met with an outpouring of opposition from the parliamentary opposition, especially the Liberal Democrats, who have promised to vote against the bill in the house of commons. The Liberal Democrats claim that the introduction of identity cards would be an affront to privacy and would not serve to deter crime. “The government’s plans for national identity cards are a waste of money and a threat to civil liberties,” said Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats. “We will not allow this bill to pass without a struggle.” They would vote against it and seek to defeat it in the house of commons. The government argues that the identity cards will help to prevent identity fraud and would facilitate the provision of government services. But critics claim that the introduction of identity cards will be an expensive and ineffective deterrent. The government has also been subjected to criticism from civil liberties groups who argue that the identity cards will be used to monitor people’s movements and will be an affront to privacy. The debate on national identity cards is set to go on for some time, and the government faces a difficult task in convincing enough members of parliament to support the bill.",
    "Not a single rupiah from the money it owed the G20, of which the United States and China are members, would be repaid in that country. The statement was accompanied by the remark that while the government was grateful for the offer, it could not yet accept the assistance, due to economic difficulties. It added that the country would continue to cooperate with its international partners to find a sustainable solution to its debt problem. The decision marks a significant shift in the attitude of the G20 towards Indonesia, formerly considered a key ally in the region. In recent years, however, relations have been strained, mainly due to problems in trade and investment. Furthermore, there is a long-standing dispute over Papua, where independence-minded rebels have been fighting against their rule by the Dutch for decades. The United States government has repeatedly expressed its concern over the situation and demanded that the government intervene more strongly in the conflict. Despite the conflict, however, Indonesia remains an important player in the global economy, with a population of more than 270 million and one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. The refusal to accept the offer of debt relief may have far-reaching consequences, both for the country itself and for its relationship with other major powers in the region.",
    "Amid the Italian political crisis, the leader of the opposition, Gianni Quirino, has asked for a new constitution that would stabilize the political system. Quirino accused the current one of being weak and very unwieldy, which made the populists so strong and gave rise to such instability. His proposed reforms include a stronger role for the regions, which would weaken the national parties and create a more federal system. He also wants to restrict the number of coalitions and minority governments, which he believes would create more lasting governments, which would allow for the implementation of long-term plans. This is the right time for such reforms, as Italy faces many challenges: an economy in crisis, an increase in debt and a sharp rise in political polarization. Quirino believes that only a new constitution with such reforms would enable Italy to overcome the current crisis and move towards a more stable and prosperous future. The Democratic Party is also highly critical of the current government’s handling of the crisis, and Quirino is publicly calling for a new election. But he made it clear that a new election would have to be under new rules that would prevent the current turmoil from happening again. The ongoing political crisis in Italy has highlighted the need for stability and consistency in its political system. Many Italians are following Quirino’s proposals for a new constitution and a number of important reforms closely, hoping they will lead to a more prosperous and stable future.",
    "Serena Williams is playing for the first time in the Australian Open tournament. The American has reached the finals and will compete against Romanian Simona Halep. It is the 23rd Grand Slam tournament she has been to, and she wants to win the 24th. Despite the fact that she had to fight against some of the strongest in the field, she has been shining. She has already won four matches, including a long and hard struggle against her fellow countrywoman Venus. “It was a tough tournament, but I feel great and I’m ready for anything, no matter what Halep comes up with.” So far, she and Halep have fought three times, and Halep has won two of them. Serena is confident, however. “Halep is a great player, but I’m feeling very good on my own,” she says. “I’ve worked hard and I’m just ready to go.” The final will be a thrilling spectacle with two of the best in the world competing for the title. Serena has won 23 Grand Slam tournaments in her career, and she would like to add a 24th to the tally.",
    "Baroness Stern wanted to call for a public inquiry into the needed reforms, but at last Thursday’s meeting the peers decided that instead of public inquiries there should be a cross-party debate on the changes to the laws being proposed by the ministers.... Baroness Royall said that women had not been prepared from the day they left the cradle for the roles of king and prime minister, so there were other laws that would be broken if her son were to become king during her lifetime. “Men do have the advantage over us in surviving our loss, it seems to me,” added Baroness Howe.",

    "The American group said the world economy, which is being helped by emerging markets, will be \"excellent.\" Its shares fell after the company said its future profits would grow at a slower pace. The stock had been tumbling for some time because of concerns about the possibility of a mortgage crisis in the US. “We’re not a highly levered company, we’re a conservatively levered company. We have some exposure, but it’s long-term exposure and not just in the US,” said Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin. A major problem has been the slump in the US housing market, which has led to higher default rates in some states, such as California, and to more bankruptcies. So far these problems have not affected spending. Apart from any long-term issues, GE said one reason for its downgrade was the rise in commodity prices, because of the rising demand for resources from China, India, Russia and the Middle East. It said it expected its orders, or sales, to rise by a high single digit percentage, compared with a rise of 2.6% in 2007. The company’s industrial profits rose by 15% and revenue by 1.4%. They were helped by the performance of GE Energy Financial, which lends to businesses and has a major loan portfolio for energy companies. Its profits rose because of higher interest rates. GE said its cash flow had risen from 18.2% of sales to 27.7%, and it was confident that the coming year would be “one of the best ever.” Despite the slowdown in the US economy, it said that the rise in orders and the “excellent” state of the world economy would mean it could raise its earnings per share by 10% this year, a figure that was a little lower than had been expected. The shares fell partly because of the profits forecast. A lot depends on the speed at which interest rates fall and whether there is a drop in consumer spending. “We’re hopeful that’s not going to happen,” said Mr Sherin.",

    "Italy captain Sergio Parisse wants his team to be consistent in their Six Nations play in the hope of overcoming the lack of consistency that has hampered them in recent years. In their first game of the Six Nations, Italy lost 23-17 to Ireland despite having dominated the first half. But in their next match they had a memorable victory against Scotland, their first victory in the Six Nations since 2015. In spite of this, Italy coach Conor O’Shea believes that his team still has to work on some areas of their game if they are to mount a serious challenge for the title. “We know there are a few areas we must improve - consistency, discipline, our tackling and our power,” he said. “We have proved that we can compete with the best teams in the Six Nations but we need to show that we can do it week in, week out.” Parisse, who won his hundredth cap in the Ireland game, agrees that the key to Italy’s chances is to be consistent in attack and defence. “We have to be consistent in the small details and be sure we carry out the strategy we have agreed,” he said. “If we can do that, we will be difficult to beat.” Italy face France on Saturday in Paris and a win will put them in a strong position to reach the play-offs.",
    "Serena Williams won her seventh Australian Open title on Saturday after a gripping three-set battle against Russian rival Maria Sharapova. The number-one-ranked American had to fight off the Russian, ranked fifth, in a long match that lasted more than two hours. But in the end, the crowds cheered the outcome, a six-one, six-one score for the winner, who gave her the deserved victory. This was a triumphant return to the tournament for the veteran American, who was pregnant with her daughter Alexis at the time and had been away for a year. It was a good day for the old girl, who had already won a total of twenty Grand Slam titles, and she was overwhelmed by emotion. As for Sharapova, she hoped to win her first Grand Slam title since the French Open of 2014, but she accepted defeat and admitted that on that day the American had been the stronger player. “Serena played better today,” she said. “I had my chances, but I couldn’t take them.” This was the American’s seventeenth victory against Sharapova in twenty-four meetings, and her record of nine consecutive wins in the finals of Grand Slam tournaments was continued. This was also her twenty-third Grand Slam title, tying her with German legend Steffi Graf, second only to the ten Grand Slam titles of the great Martina Navratilova. Serena, now thirty-six, was not yet thirty.",

    "And, in the face of this threat, Marlborough leads the mighty troops of war: all kingdoms tremble at his hands. The most proud of enemies have to admit that valour and courage here, united, rule. Europe has recognised this hero’s glory. Behold him, great and high and triumphant, with the armies of victory, enthroned above. Exalted on the wings of fame, he soars, And spreads his winning banners on distant shores. No danger, no fatigue stops his arms, his proud deeds. Across fields of death, where the cannons thunder, he goes steadfastly, fearlessly — and, in his field of victory, the great battle has been won! No craft can save the enemy when Marlborough is at the helm, and no plan can succeed against him. The noble warrior is a force to be reckoned with, and where he is the master he wins or leaves. He transmits their laws to grateful nations, and readily accepts the demands of tyranny. The acquitted slave has learned his rights, and has a new experience of liberty. The wounded Thames, its waves, whose dread wailing has been long, Has its woman-nymphs, once ravished, restored to their might. Oh great Marlborough, whose noble name shines like a meteor in the ranks of fame, Whose actions will fill the trumpet of fate, Whose own words will best recite his deeds. Your monuments, great through the ages, will carry the praise of your warlike worth. The love of your country, the just regard of your prince, will turn into the blessings of great reward. May your life, your glory, last long, And showers of blessings rain down on your head. May victory, honour ever attend your martial steps, and protect your sacred person. And grateful millions, grateful ages, with joy, happiness, hail thee, Marlborough, with joy, happiness, hail!",

At each step we are closer, Always side by side. Our hearts are entwined, never to be separated. With each stride we find our way, Together we walk, in love, unending. Life’s twists and turns we endure, We go through life together, our love is true. We leave our mark at every step, Together we walk, through light and dark.

However much we pursue and chase, The universe will have its own plan; We may stumble and fall, But in it will whisper all our purpose. For in the depths of this tapestry, Fate’s thread runs deep, Guiding us to encounters profound, Where love and longing lie entwined.

Our destiny is bound to our heartbeats and every breath we take. There’s no escape from its embrace, for destiny and life’s design are intertwined.",
    "Over the keen, dark smells of damp, brown coal, The bristling screens of the colliery banks, Miners with their weights on their belts, their empty lunches dangling; As they run they gossip about their housework, The clean-swept kitchen stove, The children’s milk before they go to bed; White roads wind through the heather, And a lark sings above the corn; On long summer afternoons, The haystacks sway in the heat. Where the green hills slope down to the plain, The church stands with its slate roof, And the graves lie clustered by the porch in the green grass of the churchyard. Here, in the March wind, the beeches roar, And the rooks caw, And the house shines in the slanting sunlight. But when winter’s winds come, through the bare trees on the lane, The houses are silent, the chimneys are smokeless, The fields are white with snow.",

She calls me from the darkness and longs to press me to her heart. Comfort me, night, with the strength of your love. As the rose fills the garden with its fragrance, so you fill the mountains with your passionate scent. The passionate night wind is blowing in the treetops. The rustling of the trees says, “Come, come to me.” Come lovers, come to the mountain! The night is boundless and her arms are strong. She stretches them out over the mountains. You must come and stretch out on the fragrant grass and float on the waves of darkness. You must give yourself to her arms. The night is all-powerful and speaks the language of lovers. She speaks in the mountain valleys, enchanting everyone. Anyone who hears her once will never forget her. Many nights I have stayed in the mountains and many nights I have waited until her voice called me. Many nights I have pressed my lips to her beauty, And drunk the sweetness of her breast. I have drunk the sweetness of her breast and I have left her arms to praise her with a kiss and a song. I know only one song, I have learned it in the night, but it is sweet. Let me sing it again.",

    "The last few months have brought public comment on the plight of venomous snakes and other animals, as we might say, suffering from human cruelty. It is no great stretch to say that some of the poisoning was also self-inflicted, and there have been some appalling examples of cruelty, carelessness, and incompetence. But I also think that we have tried to mitigate the effects of the venom and the suffering. “They are so pretty, as long as their little heads don’t get bitten off, too,” or “How sad, but the babies are pretty and don’t look so bad off as people.” Or “I hope the babies grow up healthy,” or “The poor babies.” Or perhaps even, “The babies are just as pretty as the grown-ups who eat them.” If you have friends or family who think the babies will grow up healthy, perhaps you can give them my book. If you have no friends or family who think the babies will grow up healthy, then maybe you can try my book on them, and you might find some who do. But don’t mistake kindness for sympathy. They are complicated creatures, like animals. And not all of them will leave the maternity ward looking like Barbie dolls. So, of course, some of the babies were pretty. And some of the babies are still alive. But the ones who are alive aren’t having any fun and probably don’t know what’s happened to their babies in the maternity ward. As they try to understand what’s going on, they wonder, like we do, whether they will ever see their babies again. The maternity ward is run by a man who gave a friend permission to skin some of his animals. The friend had promised to sell the animals, but she came back a few days later to tell him she couldn’t go through with the deal. It’s a little too scary to think about how terribly things could turn out. It was a friend of a friend. There was nothing in the records to indicate this. And so now it’s the man’s problem, to find out what’s become of the babies and their parents.",
    "My parents were both born in Denmark and have remained there since. My father's family had come to America when he was a very young man. He had lived many years in Sweden, and it is not surprising that he returned to his home. I was about five years old when my parents brought me to America. We settled in New Jersey, and my mother became a teacher of English in a high school. It was during this time that I learned to speak Danish, and I remember very well how they said the word 'come', as they said: \"Kommen kommer,\" meaning \"We are going together.\" That made me think that maybe I would live in Denmark one day. But then I realized that I didn't want to live there, I just wanted to stay here with my parents. So I began to ask questions about the life in Denmark, and asked my parents if I could come over every weekend. And they said yes. This was a great thing for me, because I liked to visit the Danes so much. Most of my weekends I spent there, and I always felt like I belonged there. I also got to meet some of my favorite people there. One day, while I was playing outside with my friends, I saw a man passing by. He looked very familiar, but I couldn't remember who he was. Then I saw that he was wearing a hat with a red band around it. I thought: That's probably my uncle! I ran over to him and said that. He smiled and said he was called Peter. I was very happy to meet my uncle again! After all these years I had finally met my uncle! I miss him so much. He came with his family to America, but we stayed in New Jersey.

    "I don't know yet what I want to be when I grow up, but I know that I will never forget my first day of school. It was the first time I had been in the classroom, and it felt like a second home. The teacher was very kind and attentive to me. She asked me about myself and how I liked school. She gave me some homework, too, and I remember how I could hardly wait to get down to work. I didn't understand what it was all about or why I was supposed to do it, but I did it, and I finished it. I liked school. I liked to learn new things. I liked to make new friends. I liked to play.

    "I don’t know what happiness is, but I do know that it isn’t something that you can see or touch, it’s something that you have to experience for yourself, and if you are lucky enough to experience it, you’ll find happiness in the simple things of life.

You don’t find happiness by trying to make others happy, you find it by doing the right thing. If you want to make someone else happy, try to make them smile.

I only did not expect to feel that I had been there. This is not a story about a campfire or a fire. This is a story about a place where people gather for warmth and conversation, where they share their experiences and laugh together. They can forget themselves and relax. And here we are at the end of our journey. Here we can finally rest. And when we do, we will find ourselves on the road again. See you soon.",

    "Under the eyes of Chairman Mao, in the hot summer air, a group of people united in the young and old, demanding justice, on the fourth day of June. The voice was heard in the night, a rallying cry against the iron fist. A thousand candles flashed in the dark, and the quietness of the square was ignited. One person, with his luggage in his hand, stood before the tiger; against the rolling tanks, he never lost courage. Symbolizing courage and treason, he challenged the injustice. Tears flowed and blood flowed under the red sun, and the spirit of the people could not be broken. In the shadow of the massacre, the voice is still heard; the freedom of the song will not stop. At dawn, the world watched in silence, and the square was empty under the yoke of the government. The shadow of the love is always in the heart of the lover, waiting for the day when the tide of injustice will turn. In the silent night, the brave words are still sung in the square, echoing the legacy of those who are fighting for the people's cause. On June 4, the stone is carved with the date, remembering the power of the people joining hands.",
    "On this green earth, where we walk today, a symphony of gods once stood. Duke of Marlborough, a seraphim in armor, with a stoic face. Oh, hero, where the golden fields lie, war lingers in the smoky hoods. You stood unyielding, in the ghastly blaze, like a flaming spire in the cold glare of the night. By the bloody moon, you led us to our destiny. With the sword of justice in your steadfast grip, we armed ourselves with silent reverence. The brooks and the ravines resounded with your name, as the bloody fields of Flanders claimed their just recompense. The ground shook with your furious disdain; Marlborough, Duke of Marlborough, unmoved in the midst of pain. Like a storm, you rode into the night, the embodiment of sovereign power. In triumph, in the grasp of victory, you wove your glory in the midst of battle’s fray. In the waking day, victory whispered in our ear. It was not for glory or for riches unknown, it was for freedom’s sake that you bravely stood. Beneath the weight of heaven, you bore our trust, in the rain of iron, in the bloody veils of dust. O Marlborough, hewed in marble, carved in memory’s heart, where you soared above. And now the stars will gleam in silent homage, reflecting your courage’s steadfast stream. In cherub song, in lark-song, the ode to the wars you held at bay. In humble prayers, we shall speak of you with ardent love and deep care. For in this world of shifting dreams, we shall recount the tale of the Duke, to whom we owe our George.",
    "In the forest’s heart, where sunlight glistens, The ancient oak tells the tale of dreams. Nearby, a modest willow. Together, they are tallest of all. The oak’s branches reach toward the sky. The willow’s trunk bends with the wind. Its roots bury deep, never to yield. Its golden blossoms are a joy for the eye, A hope that shines in the darkest night. Unlikely pair, They stand in the forest’s embrace, A sign of harmony, In the wild, boundless space. The oak’s age-old wisdom is full of truth; The seasons’ changes it faithfully tells, Under the unending blue of sky and heaven. The willow’s gentle swaying is soothing and fair; Its golden blossoms are a reminder That beauty is most simple, Most clear, Most free. In the middle of the forest, by moonlight bright, The two dance in silent dreams. And listen to the wind whispering through the trees, The story of the oak and the willow, of strength in union, of deep love.",

The healing balm for every ache, the balm distilled from time itself, a potion to slake the dread thirst of the weary. The old herbs, the holy roots, the crystals kissed by the moon, the songs that echo through the night, the sun at noon. The secret whispers of the wind, the story of fire, the healing touch of Mother Earth. The dance of autumn leaves, the silence of winter’s song, spring’s delicate kiss on the blossoming bud, the endless summer days. The universe and life pulse with one rhythm, and it is within our hands to find the medicine. The ancient wisdom, the ancient knowledge, are the remedies for modern sickness, more precious than gold. The birds in the trees, the breeze on the water, the whisper of the trees, the secret murmur of the seas, are the old medicines that set the spirit free. The laughter of a child, the comfort of a friend, the love without end, the peace without end. The joy of a moment, the strength to stand erect, are the medicines of time, the greatest cure. So listen to the silence, learn the rhythms of the universe. Then the medicine of time will heal.",

We are only the stitches of the cosmic dance, bound by the rhythm of the circle; we are the dreamers, seekers, and the lost; we are the seas of life, stormy and tempestuous.

In the silence of night, in the thunder of day, in the pulse of our hearts, is our destiny. In the mirror of our soul, in the depths of our hearts, in the story of our eyes, in the echoes of laughter, in the tears we cry, in the tapestry of time, is our destiny.

I lie on my towel and feel free, and I have left all my troubles behind, my heart is wild and carefree. The sea is vast, and it is blue like a painting; I see the seagulls soaring high, their calls echoing in the sky. The beach is all mine, my own little paradise, the place of my dreams. No crowds, no noise, but tranquility, a refuge from the clamor of the world. I close my eyes and I am happy, lost in this place. The rhythm of the sea is lullaby; it is carrying me gently and carrying me away. In this moment, I am free, a free spirit, my heart soars and my mind is in the clouds. The world outside is dark, and the beach is my own.",
    "Once a bright angel, pure and fair, With wings that glowed like the stars in flight, You lived in the heavens and were seen by all, A heavenly choir, a symphony. Your voice was like a sweet wind that calmed everyone, The sweetest hymns were like a melody, That comforted hearts and minds. But then, a tempting whisper, a tempting thought, A spark of curiosity, a forbidden question, You questioned the ways of the divine, You questioned what was not yours. You fell, a tragic fall, A descent into the shadows, Your wings were clipped, not free, You were a fallen angel, lost and confused. The world was a strange place, wicked and strange, Where sin and sorrow were kings, You wandered lost and disillusioned, A stranger in a world of confusion. Your voice, no longer pure and sweet, now soiled by the ways of the world, Your wings, once so bright, now dull and grey, A shadow of your former grace. But there is still a spark of hope, A tiny spark, a burning flame, For though you fell, you are not alone, And grace and love can still be yours. Lift your head, dear fallen one, And let love guide you, For though you may have lost your wings, You will find a different grace.",

And orange is our cousin Sarah’s shade, The light of a summer evening’s shin. Then Dad, our gentle giant, smiled. Our Mother, our Mother, in white, is a vision, Guiding us all with her might. Like a rose adored, she grows with love. Like our bond, it never grows old. Our family of roses, strong and true, Evokes new love songs in our hearts.",

    "There I lie at your feet, unloved and unnamed. So let it be known that I died for freedom. The world in which I live denied me existence, because no place on earth had been agreed on for my burial, and not even my own mother knew where I was. You brought me flowers, and you placed them close, but you did not notice how close I lay, and as flowers are the tears of the living, that might have meant something, had it not been for the fact that throughout my life people were so indifferent to my fate. Hence death found me unnamed.",

    "So God’s hand had to come down upon him, for this was his business. But he is a curse in the land. ’ Tis not the history of Jeremiah’s life we read here, but the history of the times in which he lived. He tells us what God had revealed to him. He describes the situation as it was, or as it could be guessed at this time, and then tells us that from this time Jeremiah began his prophetic work and raised his voice against the obstinately hardened people. He is the prophet, and so is God’s mouthpiece for the purpose of remonstrating with his people and calling them to repentance. He is not himself a subject of grace, so as to speak to the large number of mankind who are under the reign of grace. And so he speaks not of justification by faith (Romans 3:21) or of sanctification, nor of Jesus Christ, nor of the atonement, nor of the life of righteousness and holiness in God, nor of the hope of immortality, of resurrection, and of eternal life, as the prophet Moses was made to do. The latter did not speak at first. The law was given, but the gospel had not yet been given. He spoke of a prophet who should come after him (Deuteronomy 18:15). Jeremiah does not speak of justification and sanctification, for he lived in the time when the promises to the Jewish nation through Moses were fulfilled (Deuteronomy 18:15; Jeremiah 3:14–15), when the time had come for the fulfilment of the prophecies he had uttered of the coming of the Messiah. Jeremiah speaks as a prophet, but not as an ambassador of the gospel. He had not received a commission from God to preach the doctrine of justification by faith and sanctification through and in Christ Jesus. He had received a commission to preach, or rather to prophesy, that Jerusalem would be destroyed, that the king would be put to death, and that Jerusalem would be a prey to the Chaldeans and the Philistines.",

It blinds us to the truth, It clouds our mind, It makes us deaf to all things, It leads us to do anything, To get one more power. But the end of it is that there is nothing, But emptiness and sorrow, The cost of the benefits of this addiction is not understood. So let us break this wheel, And let us find a different path, Let us seek power in love, And we will be full at the end.",

Rising up into the clouds, Then sinking into the sky, Mountains, trees, and rivers are alive With their own magic spells. When the flowers bloom, And bees are flying from one to another, The symphony of Nature continues to play, And the melody is never-ending. And let us love this world of ours, Which has so much beauty to offer; Let us appreciate its myriad charms, For it is a paradise, Our own earthly paradise.",

But they are not calling to me tonight, for God knows that tomorrow there will be no one to care whether life goes or comes back... So let them toll till dawn, till the sun is up, and the bells are heard over the vastness of the land, where today many millions live, while others sleep beneath its soil, their lives as a dream, like flowers whose petals fall to the ground... And may the bells still ring as loudly at noon, when they ring across this wide land, where many millions live today, while others sleep beneath its soil, their lives but a dream which soon will fade, like flowers whose petals fall to the ground...",

    "3. Turn on the oven to broil for five minutes. Pour into a greased 8x12 pan. Add 1 cup of grated Cheddar cheese and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. This is a very simple dish, but I bet that if you ask ten people to make it, you'll get ten different recipes, just like mac and cheese, spaghetti, or roast beef. As the editor of The Salt, I was very interested in a recent article in Science about the biological basis of cooking, which I suppose is what makes people \"enchilada casserole\" in the first place. In this paper, two biologists at Columbia University, Marco Mattiacci and Silke Wandsnider, argue that people's desire to seek out tasty foods with a lot of sugar, salt, or fat is an old, deeply rooted human behavior. I'm sure you know people in a state of anxiety or exhaustion, stress, they often reach for snacks or candy, they don't have a choice. It wasn't until now that some scientists realized that our desire to look for energy food was deeply rooted in the emergence of our species. \"We eat more than we need to survive, but our body is designed to eat more than we need to eat, because it has been in the long run \"Evolution has made us do this in order to prepare for a famine that never comes, he says. Then he explains that we can explain this biological process in our digestive system, but there are two parts that we cannot understand: the first is that, while a lot of people have a strong inclination to eat high-energy, savory foods to feel good, so they will not be used in the daily diet.",

The recipe does not give specific advice for the preparation of the ingredients, only a suggestion to heat the tortillas before serving. This is a tactic to heat the meal, not the other way around. There is no suggestion about how long to simmer, so the cooks must guess. This gives the possibility of describing the sequence and order of the ingredients. It is suggested, for example, that the beans should be warmed before serving. It can be assumed that the beans are warmed in the microwave or in boiling water.

    "I have just re-watched The Wire and I really like it, but there is one scene that I just cannot stand. I know the intention of the series is to present the brutal reality of the Baltimore drug trade in the nastiest possible way, but this scene feels in the least realistic and is totally unnecessary. It just seems like a cheap attempt to shock the audience and bring the shock value to the series. Personally, I feel The Wire works best when it focuses on the complex characters, the intricate plots and the social issues that the series raises, but this scene is completely irrelevant and completely out of place. It is disappointing to see a series that is otherwise so good have a moment that doesn’t work for me.",

    "I thought I would tell you the strangest thing that happened to me today. I have had, to tell the truth, the strangest experience of my life. I was walking down the street, when I noticed a crowd gather in a little park. Curious to know what it was, I went to look and to my astonishment found a group of street entertainers giving the most wonderful show I had ever seen. They were not ordinary street entertainers. They were dressed in the most wonderful costumes, and they had the most amazing talents. There was a fire-eater, a acrobat, a magician, even acrobats. The energy and excitement was quite palpable. I felt I had come upon a real magic trick. I stood there spellbound by their skills, which seemed to defy the laws of nature. Then it was as if time had stood still and I had been transported into a different world. The audience was cheering and clapping, so enthusiastic were they. I joined in with them, unable to resist the sheer delight of it. It was a moment of pure joy and amazement, and I shall never forget it. Afterwards I spoke to some of the performers. They were so modest and so devoted to their profession. They told me about their travels and the difficulties they had to overcome as street performers. It was inspiring to see how much they loved what they did. As I left the park, I felt as if I had experienced the greatness of art and the capacity it has to unite people. I wanted to share it with you all, because it was such an unforgettable experience. I hope you all stop and enjoy any street performers you may come across. You never know what magic you may witness. Be curious and keep on seeking those surreal moments. Here’s to them!",
    "Among the ruins of the city, I have recently met a strange being which has made me both amazed and distressed. This being, unlike all the others I have met, seems to have exhausted its food, and it is a chilling reminder of the result of an unbridled consumption, which can be disastrous for our environment. This once formidable beast, still roaming the countryside, wanders and wanders without finding any food. Its once powerful and muscular frame has wasted away, leaving only a skeleton. Its eyes, once shining with a sharp predatory light, now show an intense emptiness. The monster's desperate movements plow the deserted landscape, slow and painful. A groan, a lamentable cry resounds in the empty places, a cry of hunger, of the nostalgia for something that no longer exists. As I watch this being, I cannot help thinking of the consequences of our actions. We too are capable of consuming without thinking of the consequences, of exhausting our natural resources, of destroying the balance of the environment. This monster is a warning that our actions have far-reaching consequences. It is a warning that if we do not change our ways, we too will find ourselves in a world without food. We must take responsibility for our actions and seek to find sustainable solutions before it is too late. In the suffering of this being, I am reminded of the importance of compassion and pity. We must not ignore the suffering of others, whether they are human beings or animals. It is our duty to protect and preserve the balance of the environment for the sake of all beings. I wish this monster to serve as a reminder of the consequences of our actions. I wish this monster to serve as a means of transformation, a tool to force us to rethink our priorities, to choose solutions which can ensure a better future for everyone.",
    "The scene in The Wire in which the two cops, Detectives mcNulty and Moreland, repeating incessantly the word ‘damn’, is just awful and for me the worst part of the show. The characters are terrific and it was a stupid decision on the part of the writers to include it. When a show is as good as The Wire, silly decisions like this really do stick out and spoil the whole. Basically, the scene makes both characters look foolish and that’s a real pity.",
    "I need advice. My mother died a few months ago. She was in perfect health, rode twenty miles a day, did yogic exercises, was very agile and very athletic. I found her lying face down in her office, presumably from a heart attack, and she was dead in a few minutes. There was no premonition, no heart trouble. It was a complete surprise to everyone because she was healthy as a horse. It has been very difficult for me, but I think the most difficult for my husband. He was very close to her and now he seems to be so lost, lost, and is probably very much hurt. He doesn't want to talk about it, he just lives. He says he is fine, but he is so emaciated. They were very close, he used to talk to her every night, he just came and looked at her for a few minutes. I do not know what to do for him. We have a little daughter, so we are very seldom alone. When we are alone, he just sits and looks at the air. I try to ask him about it, but he says he's fine. It breaks my heart. I know he is very much pained and I would like to heal him, but I do not know how. I am looking for advice on how to be there for him and help him. I know he does not want to talk about it yet, but when he wants to, I want to be able to help him. Any advice is very welcome. Thanks.",
    "I’m twenty-two, and I’ve been living with my best friend since August. At first, I was just happy to live with one of my best friends. We’ve always been there for each other. I was studying for the MCATs, and he had a job far away, so we didn’t see each other much. But over time, I’ve come to care for him. I knew it was risky to live with someone you were fond of, but I never expected to feel this way. It’s been four months now. I’m crazy about him. Everything he does is so charming and adorable. Sometimes, when he laughs or when he’s cooking, I’m stricken with goose bumps. I can’t seem to help myself. I think about him all the time. I dream about him. My stomach turns every time he walks in the room or even looks at me. I like being in his presence. When he’s not here, I miss him terribly. Sometimes, I cry, because I miss him so much. When he comes back, I’m ecstatic, because I know he’s here. I love him and don’t want to be without him. I feel like I’m going to explode if I don’t tell him how I feel. But I’m afraid. I know he doesn’t feel the same way about me, and that I’m taking a huge risk in telling him. What if he starts feeling awkward living with me after I tell him? What if it destroys our friendship? I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt this way about anyone before. I’ve always liked the idea of loving someone so much that it hurts, but I never thought I would actually feel this way.",

I know that it sounds as if I am overreacting, but this is what I feel twenty-four hours a day. I am so terrified of dying that I avoid everything that is even slightly dangerous. I do not go out at night because I am afraid of being robbed. And when I am at home I always check the locks on the doors and make sure that the windows are closed. I know that I must seek professional help, but I am terrified of going to a shrink. I have never talked to anyone about my feelings, and I am terrified at the thought of opening up to a stranger. I am afraid they will think I am crazy or they will judge me. I know I must take some action, but I do not know what to do. I am so terrified all the time, and I do not want to live like this any more. Please tell me what I must do. I cannot stand this feeling any longer.",
    "Oh, yes: my family has talked about inside information they have received about terrorist attacks on major American cities, about nukes and about the corresponding government reaction. They have amassed enormous stockpiles of food and ammunition in case of economic collapse and have pressured me to do the same, inflicting deep wounds to my financial resources in the process. They have rehearsed doomsday scenarios in a way that overlaps absurd Qanon conspiracy theories, often with me present, in a completely serious tone. They have tried to get me to wear a headlamp around the clock for my “protection” and when I refused, they insisted I at least wear “magical” jewelry from a “magical” woman to protect me. When I refused that, too, they told me I was “on my own.” In short, my family has become radically paranoid and that has had a huge impact on my life. Thanks for your advice. This isn’t the first time they’ve done this sort of thing, but it is the first time it has affected me so much.",
    "Well, here is a post without a title: The scene in The Wire where McNulty and Moreland just keep saying the word ‘fuck’ over and over again is dreadful. Watching it was terribly uncomfortable, and, I must say, I feel very awkward about it to this day. Though the scene might indicate the frustration and anger the two characters feel, I feel there are other ways of expressing anger without the use of such profanity. I consider this scene to be one of the most offensive parts of the entire series. What are your thoughts?",

    "I would say: ‘ Go!’ There is nothing wrong in seeking help and talking openly with your parents, especially about something as important and personal as your mental health. Talking to those close to you about depression and anxiety may be difficult and scary, but by opening up, you’ll enable them to understand you better and they’ll be able to help and support you.

    "I have sometimes, when I have found something a bit hard to accept or understand, had the reaction of “Oh, it’s a woman,” or “It must be a difficult time for her,” or “Are you going to take my children away?” But here there is a more obvious implication: you don’t like women, and there’s nothing you can do about it. In the same way as a man, who was in a public place, is the focus of concern, the woman is the focus of concern. This is a long post, because you’ll only see it once, so if you want to skip to the comments here’s a link, and if you want to read on, here you are. The author points out that this “threat” is not a physical or tangible threat, but it is still a threat, in the sense that it is a threat to her, and in the sense that she did not have the option of not being threatened. It is worth reading the whole of the article, because the author was able to draw an interesting distinction. Here the attacker who thought the man was going to hurt the woman, did not take him away from her. She was not in charge of who was going to attack her. She was sexually assaulted. “If a man had got off the bus, gone up to her, punched her in the face and said he loved her, in that moment he would have assaulted her,” the author continued. The author then gave a very good example of how rape culture works: “The attacker was not just hurting me physically, like my attacker did, but he was also sexually assaulting me, just as he was assaulting me sexually by putting his peen into her,” just as he was assaulting her by trying to put his fingers between her breasts, just as he was assaulting her by making her ram her head against his penem.” Because she did not have the option of turning round (and probably even if she had, she wouldn’t have been able to), and because she did not have the option of whether and when or even whether she felt afraid, the attacker was able to exercise control over her.",

She simply stayed single and married some ghoul, who probably died at the age of twenty, and started a family with him. My siblings and I were born soon afterward—and in the course of events she was lost in history. She had a good job at the time as a saleswoman for another company. To add to this theme, I was pregnant during that time (my younger sister says it was just four months), and the doctors assured us that it would result in a child. I went along with my mother’s hope that I would have many siblings. Well, that wish came to nothing, because I had twins, born three weeks apart. When they did the ultrasound they saw two tiny legs in addition to the head, which had already been known for a while, but no one paid any attention to it until about seven weeks after conception. Well, after several abortions, the whole affair ended quickly when I discovered that my uterus had grown out of my pelvis, resulting in a double amputated baby. This added to the interest of the story. I was fairly short for my size, six foot, and two inches. While I was waiting for the surgery, there were some complications, so I had to go home for a while... needless to say, things weren’t going well. Then finally, about five weeks before the operation, one of their gynecologists, who had just finished with me, called me to his office. “Do you want to have the shot tonight?” he asked. Of course, as I had already been suffering for about six hours, I turned down his offer and took a few days off from work (because of money). The procedure took a little longer because of the complications, and my stomach is just now beginning to digest food, so I must watch my weight during the recovery. Fortunately, I had already eaten dinner earlier today, only a few scrambled eggs and meatloaf. So the first thing I feel is how aching I am. The pain feels like burning acid, and the next hour will be the most painful of my life. The doctor is probably expecting me soon; he’s probably waited long enough.",
    "This is a symptom of the new ASUS RT-AC68U. I just ran into this with an Asus RT-AC68U and an iPhone 4S. The network does not support IPFS. I'm in the field for work right now and haven't been able to test my own connections, but the same thing happens to me when I'm out weeding outside my front door. Since it's winter, I think it's not a problem of ethernet or Wi-Fi, because when I go upstairs I'll try to use ethernet in the house to see if that fixes the problem (we don't use Wi-Fi). Is anyone else still having this problem? Edit: It may be the solution to one of the problems. If you are willing to share your IPFS address, please post a comment below.",
    "I know that The Wire is generally considered to be one of the best tv shows of all time, but there is one scene that I absolutely hate. It’s a scene with detectives Moreland and McNulty sitting in a car and each of them saying “fuck” a bunch of times. It’s really horrible and it really takes me out of the show. What do you think?",

    "People who believe in democracy are crazy. What is the sense of letting everybody decide what is done? The majority of people are not educated enough to be able to take the best decision, but they vote according to their feelings or the impression they have received from the press. In my opinion, a dictatorship is far better. The dictator will be a man who knows what is best for the country and will decide what is to be done, and the people will just have to obey him. The result would be far better, and the life of the people would be far more comfortable. What do you think? Is my idea stupid?",
    "I need to say a few words about this scene from The Wire, mainly because I can't see why people praise it so much. For those who don't know, there is a scene in season 1 where Detectives McNulty and Bunk Moreland are investigating a crime scene, and they don't say a word, not a single word, except \"stupid.\" I know it has been praised for demonstrating how effectively communication can take place, even with a single word. I even agree that the acting of Dominic West and Wendell Pierce is superb and that they are able to convey a range of emotions by their expressions and body language. But I find it boring to watch. It strikes me as lazy and a waste of creative talent, rather than as smart or clever. There is so much more they could have done with that scene. Dialogue is the great strength of The Wire, and the characters come alive through fragments of dialogue, filled with Baltimore slang. Cutting out all that language just detracted from the scene. It was also completely at odds with the realism that The Wire is often praised for. In real life, no matter how angry or frustrated they may be, professionals communicate much more effectively. The scene strikes me as an attempt to be memorable and original that fails, and comes across as forced and unrealistic. And finally, I worry that it could give a wrong impression of the series to newcomers. If someone were to skim through the episodes and came across this one, they might come to the wrong conclusion that The Wire is all about swearing and nothing else, which would be a grave error. In short, I found it a low point in an otherwise outstanding series, and I wanted to share my thoughts to see if others share my opinion. Although I'd also be interested to hear from those who think it's good, and why they like it.",
    "Hey everyone, I know that speculation continues as to whether or not DFV (DeepFuckingValue) will sell his share of the company. This man is the guarantor of the whole business that so many of us have been following. Despite the fact that he was the first to publicly invest in the company, long before the massive short squeeze of the share, it has been reported that he has been buying stock at a price of $ 5. It is quite strange that he hasn't yet sold the shares at this crazy peak of $ 480. But of course, none of us can read his mind. Getting into the stock market always involves risks and speculation about the future price. But now that his share has become a billionaire, it would seem to be sensible to take the profit at some point. However, if he were to sell his share, the price might collapse again because of his enormous influence in the GME community. And so it might be a question of continuing to support the \"little people\" and fight against the big Wall Street institutions. And he really seems to believe in the long-term growth of the company. Of course this is all speculation. I just want to ask for your opinion. Any prediction of when he might sell? And if he ever will sell or keep the share for the rest of his life? Let's talk about it.",

    "I have a few issues with my third generation Tacoma and I hope someone here can help me. The problems seem to be electrical, but I'm not sure. First of all, the dashboard lights blink a little, as if on a strobe. It doesn't seem to matter if I drive or if I just sit and the lights blink on and off. I have checked the fuses, but they all seem to be good, so I'm not sure what it is. Secondly, the radio isn't working properly. It sometimes does not turn on at all, sometimes it comes on, but no sound comes out. I have tried to reset it, but it doesn't seem to help. Thirdly, the electric windows have been slow to respond.

    "“I have always had a great desire to adopt children. Since I was a young girl, whether I was single or in a relationship, I have always had a resolute view that there are so many children in the world who need love that I would prefer to adopt rather than have children of my own. My friends and family often tell me this is a very radical view. They tell me there is something natural, something innate, in wanting to have children from one’s own womb. They talk about the bond, about passing on one’s own genes, about seeing something of one’s own personality in the child. Some of them are even afraid of the difficulties of adopting, of having a child that is not one’s own. I understand their arguments, but I can’t shake off the desire, the need to adopt. Is this a crazy way of thinking? It may be unusual, but is it in any way unsound? There must be others who share this view. Adopted people, parents who have adopted, people who can give me their experiences. Please help me understand the different aspects of this view.” I would appreciate any views, experiences, insights you might be able to give me.",

I know they're just there for comedy, but their relationship is so toxic and unhealthy that it's really disgusting.\" First of all, he's a horrible person, selfish and calculating and has no qualms about using people for his own gain. He is constantly exploiting Roz's affection for him and holding her back while he himself has no intention of ever getting into a serious relationship with her, while he's never been in a serious relationship with anyone. And he dresses even worse than he acts, that vest and cowboy hat are a crime against humanity. And then Roz is no better, she's so desperate for love and attention that she willingly accepts all the abuse and indignity of her husband. She is constantly forgiving him for his bad behavior and making excuses for him, even when he doesn't deserve it. It's like she has no self-esteem and no pride. Together, they're just a disaster. They rely on lies, manipulation and a complete lack of communication to keep their relationship going. They both use each other and it's just sad to see. Some people may say that they are only a joke, but they are more harmful than funny. They reinforce the harmful stereotypes about relationships and love and they are not a good example of how a healthy couple should look. But anyway, this is just my rant. I just had to get it off my chest. What do you think? Are they the worst couple in Schitt's Creek or are they just a harmless joke? Let me know in the comments below. \"",
    "Hey fellows, I'm thinking of switching from Canon to Sony but I don't know if it's worth it. I've been using Canon for a long time and I've already got a bunch of lenses and accessories so it's a difficult decision. I have heard great things about Sony's mirrorless camera, especially the A7 series. Faster AF, better video and a smaller and lighter body are really tempting. And Sony sensors seem to be good in low light, which is important for the type of photography I do. But I'm also worried about leaving my Canon gear. I've spent a lot of money on lenses and accessories over the years and I know they're high quality. Will I be able to achieve the same quality with Sony? Is it worth selling everything and starting from scratch with Sony? I would really like to hear your opinion and experiences from those of you who have made the switch. Did it pay off for you? Have you had any regrets? Any tips for making the transition as smooth as possible? Thanks in advance for your input!",
    "I know that there are a lot of people who think that the argument of the preparation time of Batman is a joke and an overstatement, but I'm here to argue that it's a good thing. First, let's acknowledge that Batman is a master crime fighter. He's been doing it for years, and he's had his fair share of both successes and failures. He knows what works and what doesn't, and he changes his strategy to keep one step ahead of his enemies. Now, as far as preparation time goes, Batman is meticulous. He plans everything in detail, from the weapons he carries, to the equipment he uses, to the routes he takes. He's not just throwing up his hands and hoping for the best. He's a tactician, and he knows that every second counts. But here's the thing: Batman's preparation time isn't just for him. It's for his allies as well. When he goes on a mission, he's not only thinking about his own safety and success, but also about the safety and success of his allies. He makes sure that his allies have the right equipment, the right training, and the right strategy to put out the bad guys. And let's not forget, it's not just about Batman fighting crime for the sake of fighting crime. He's fighting for justice, fighting for right, fighting to protect the weak and innocent from the people who are trying to harm them. By taking the time to prepare himself, he's not just saving his own skin. He's saving many lives. So the next time you hear that the argument of the preparation time of Batman is silly, just remember that it's not just about Batman. It's about his commitment to justice, his devotion to his allies, and his unwavering desire to protect the people of Gotham. Thanks for reading, redditors! Let me know what you think.",
    "I have noticed, fellow Uzis, that our man’s Twitter activity has slowed down of late. I’m not sure what’s going on, but it’s definitely not the usual Uzi content we’re used to. I’ve been following him for a while, and I’ve noticed that he used to post something at least a couple of times a day, but now it’s only once or twice a week. And it’s usually a brief retweet or something, instead of the more substantial, longer posts he used to put up. I’m starting to get a little worried, my man. Is everything alright?

In the meantime, let’s all keep spreading the Uzi love, and sharing his music and videos like the good old days. Have you noticed this? What do you think is going on?",
    "I am twenty years old and have suffered from anxiety for about two years, but it has become so bad that I can barely function anymore. At first it was only the feeling of a strange restlessness in the presence of people and in social situations, which was bad enough in itself, but then it grew into anxiety attacks, which sprang up at odd times during the day and now occur at almost any time. My heart beats so hard I feel I’m going to die, I get dizzy and giddy, and sometimes I even pass out. When that happens I start shaking and crying hysterically because I don’t know what else to do. This makes things ten times worse, not only because people look at you like a lunatic, but also because your body feels like it’s shutting down completely. After the attack I always think that I’ll never be able to recover, which only brings on another one. I’ve tried pills (Zoloft) and they don’t seem to help either; if anything, they make it worse, because I get more nervous knowing there’s something inside me that’s trying to calm me down. I’ve been to therapy, where I’ve been told all sorts of things, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation. But none of it works, because once the attack has hit me, there’s no stopping it, I have to let it run its course. I’ve lost friends because of this; nobody wants to be around someone who’s in a constant state of terror. And to tell the truth, I don’t want it either! But no matter what I do, I can’t seem to control these attacks, they take over completely and leave me powerless, waiting to see what’s going to happen next. Sometimes I wish I were dead so I wouldn’t have to go through this any longer. But then suicide may not be the answer either, considering how many other people suffer from similar problems. Either way, my life is awful right now...",

    "After my mother’s death I felt that everything reminded me of her in some way, and it hurt to see or hear or even smell something that made me remember how much I missed her. Some months later I was frightened by something that really reminded me of her, but then I laughed and laughed and was able to go on with my life and be hurt by those small incidents no longer. I had just moved out of the house after a long time (my mother had died some six years before) and was living in a small apartment. My brother came to see me one day and we drove up to Arby’s to get some dinner. He had flown down the previous week knowing that it was very important for me to have an easy meal and not have to eat out every time. So we drew up outside Arby’s, which had been there ever since I left home, and I nearly went out of my mind. As soon as the cars honked, waiting for us to move forward, I realized what they could see through the windows. They looked exactly like the old people’s cars parked outside restaurants when their families aren’t there. The cars were backed up, bumper to bumper, and my car was blocking the two plates, just as though it wasn’t important that people be given a place to park without blocking it for anyone else.... And worst of all, I could only leave them and go home together, as I could not drive home before then.",
    "After having looked at the map and revisited the subreddit, I have come to the following conclusion about the second floor plan. As I said, the city map was released over a week ago. As I have mentioned, the city map is a ‘solved’ part of the puzzle, meaning that it has no hidden clues. Therefore, the information required to solve the remaining parts of the puzzle must be in the book or the map which has already been released. To solve anything else, we need to be able to pinpoint a certain location. What makes this particularly difficult is that there is no hint that the locations on the map are at all relevant. A ‘location’ is a very broad concept; it could mean ‘anywhere in the universe’, or it could be something more specific, such as ‘somewhere in the city’. To make it easier to see what is going on, I have drawn up a little map below: Red dots: locations mentioned in Chapter 1 (extract from the book) Red X: locations mentioned in Chapter 2 (extract from the book) Orange line: where a ship is leaving. I have also drafted a draft of the floor plan, which I have annotated with a ruler. Please note that the scale of the floor plan is approximately the same as that of the city map. This is important. Also note that the length of the top-left arrow corresponds exactly to the length of the orange line. This is important too. This is where I have drawn a line from the arrow to the orange line. Then, at the intersection, I have drawn a second line. I think the arrow is the key to solving the final riddle.",
    "The commonest question that the parents of autistic children are faced with is: How to talk to the autistic child? First, it is important to remember that every autistic individual is unique, so there is no such thing as a universally applicable answer. But there are some tips that could be helpful for many families. One is to be patient with the autistic child. It may take them a little longer to understand and respond to social cues and questions, and they need the time to do that. Another way to communicate with autistic children is to use pictures and symbols to help them understand what is being said. Another important way to communicate with the child is to use clear and unambiguous language. Do not use complicated or indirect language, which confuses them. Instead, use short and simple sentences that avoid ambiguity. In the final analysis, it is important to try and engage the child in the conversation as much as possible. Ask them questions, let them ask you questions and make the conversation as interesting and interactive as possible. By doing this, you are building the child’s confidence and communication skills.",

    "The Gemini lunar heat shield is essential to the Artemis project, whose aim is to restore the landings on the Moon to 2024. But the recent images of the Orion spacecraft’s trial flight with a man-crewed version have caused considerable concern about the integrity of the heat shield. Some have pointed out that it seems to have suffered a number of punctures, which they think are due to a crease. Although it is difficult to make a definite assessment without more information, this observation has led many to ask whether the heat shield is damaged. Officially, NASA has not made any statement on the state of the heat shield, but has announced that it is closely following the situation and tries to gather more information. In the meantime, experts have indicated that any damage may not be of such a catastrophic nature if it can be repaired before any future mission. Others, however, fear that even a slight deterioration in the heat shield’s performance could compromise the safety of future missions and put the lives of the crewmen at risk. So it is not yet clear whether the Gemini lunar heat shield is damaged and how it will affect the plans of the project to restore landings on the Moon.",
    "If you were given £20,000 to invest, how would you do it? There are so many possibilities that it is difficult to decide. Among the favourites are stocks, bonds, real estate, and cryptocurrencies. Stocks have a long history of giving high returns, but they are also quite volatile over the short term, that is, their price fluctuates quickly, which is risky. Bonds are generally considered safer than stocks because they yield a more certain income, the coupon. But the coupon is usually lower than the dividend on stocks. Real estate, which can yield income as well as capital, can be very attractive, but it usually requires a significant initial investment and requires a lot of work to manage. Cryptocurrencies are a relatively new asset class, and it is difficult to predict how they will develop over the long term. Some investors have made a lot of money from cryptocurrencies, but they are highly volatile and their price fluctuates quickly. In the end, the best investment will depend on your personal financial goals and tolerance for risk. You may wish to spread your investment over several asset classes to spread the risk and increase the opportunity.",

    "And so it was that on the morning of May 26, I was run over by a man who was not watching where he was going. I was taken to three different hospitals in Baguio for an examination, then we decided to fly back to Metro Manila. There, I had an MRI, which revealed two fractured skulls, concussion and subdural hematoma—an accumulation of fluid in the brain due to bleeding inside or outside the skull—and brain contusion. After taking a week off from work, a period of recuperation of ten months, followed by physical therapy exercises and speech therapy, I finally finished a second round of rehabilitation recently, but didn’t recover at all.

    "I've been on the fence about this game, mostly because I don't know the universe, but it seems to have a lot of potential. I was hoping for some comments from someone who had already played it. The game will be available on Steam 27/8 (Early Access) and probably also on consoles in the second half of the year or maybe at the beginning of 2023. Does it have a lot of story? I'm not so fond of MMOs, but if it's really a single-player game, that's fine. Why do you not like MMOs? I never saw them as similar to Diablo, which I adore. To me, the best part of these games is exploring the worlds they create and getting to know the history and lore, and how you influence the worlds. And also with loot system. I haven't played many games with loot, but that was something I really enjoyed. I wanted to progress and get better equipment and then be able to look at all the beautiful things I had collected, all unique and interesting, you know what I mean? As with the Diablo games and Runescape, those are the MMOs I like. There were so many possibilities. In Elysium you play as a human who is both magician and soldier. You could be a gunslinger, a wizard, a magician or whatever you wanted. I was a magician / gunslinger. I do not remember the details of why, but I could use swords, longswords, axes and polearms at the same time. There was a lot of character design. I do not remember many details about the story or the gameplay, but the open world was really good. I loved to explore the world. You could walk for hours and suddenly find out cities, ruins and other things to discover. I also got into a big battle, which was a little strange because I did not look for combat then. I really liked character creation and customization. I was a long-ranger who did great damage. I'm a bit excited.",

She has completely inhabited the character, who is both complex and mysterious, and whose role is both delicate and wild. It is a highly seductive performance, and Mara's depth and intensity in the role are unusual. The film is a masterpiece of actor Daniel Red; he shows a perfect balance between power and vulnerability, which makes him sympathetic and understandable. The chemistry between Mara and Red is indescribable, and their scenes together are explosive. The director, David Fincher, captures the dark, hard mood of the novel admirably. The film is beautifully shot, and the use of lighting and color adds to the atmosphere. The pacing is excellent, and it is always clear and interesting without boring moments. The most impressive thing about 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is the storyline. The plot is filled with many surprises that constantly keep you guessing. The mystery unfolds slowly, and you get to know the characters and their dark secrets. The tension increases continuously and leads to a surprising and satisfying ending. The film also deals with important and delicate topics such as violence against women and corruption in the legal system, and this with a thought-provoking and unshirkable approach that sheds light on the dark underbelly of society. These themes are handled with care and respect, which makes the film even more impressive. While 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is a wonderful film, it is not for everyone. There are violent scenes and disturbing images that some people may find difficult to see. But if you can endure the nastiness, this is a movie that you absolutely must see. The whole film is well made and intense, and if you love dark and exciting thrillers, you should not miss it.",
    "Heist film: exciting and entertaining, and a worthy sequel to the original Ocean's Eleven, bringing back the charm and wit of the first. The whole cast, including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and many others, are reunited and give sparkling performances. The plot is based on the revenge of the gang led by Dante (Clooney) against the scheming casino owner Willy Bank (Pacino), who betrayed their friend Ruben (Gould). The group plans an elaborate and cunning plan to rob Bank's new casino on the first day of the gala evening, relying on each of their special skills. The plot of the robbery is a strong point of the film: it is ingeniously thought out, with each member of the gang having his role and a purpose. The film keeps you in suspense as the robbery proceeds, with unexpected twists. The action is well paced, never boring, but not hurried, and the dialogue is filled with witty remarks that make the film all the more enjoyable. Clooney, Pitt and Damon have made a great effort to get back into their roles and their banter and camaraderie are just as enjoyable as in the first film. The appearance of Al Pacino as the villain brings a new dynamic to the group and he is both threatening and charming. The whole picture is filmed with flair, capturing the bright lights and bright colors of Las Vegas. The set and cinematography are excellent, making the whole environment look attractive, and the music, especially the music by David Holmes, is evocative and adds to the whole cold and sophisticated atmosphere. Although there are no great new ideas, the film is well crafted and entertaining. It successfully brings back the spirit of the first and offers an enjoyable, light-hearted and fun experience. The fans of the series will not be disappointed, and newcomers will find themselves easily attracted to the world of Dante and his gang.",
    "‘Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan’ is a satirical masterpiece, pushing the boundaries between humour and satire. Borat Sagdiyev, a fictional character played by Sacha Baron Cohen, is both sardonic and deeply perceptive. The film follows Borat as he tours the USA and meets ordinary people who are not aware that they are participants in a fake documentary. Through his outrageous and insulting behaviour Borat uncovers the underlying prejudices and ignorance in American society. The film is cleverly written, it makes you laugh, and it makes you think. Borat’s performance is brilliant and enthralling. As the film is a supposedly documentary it is based on the reactions of the people who are not aware that they are participants in a fake documentary. He is completely in character, always delivering his lines with impeccable comic timing and physical comedy. His ability to remain in character even in the most difficult situations shows how brilliantly he combines his skills as an actor and comedian. It is important to remember that the film is a satire. It uses exaggeration and shock tactics to highlight the absurdity of prejudice and ignorance. The film is not to be taken literally but as a comment on society. ‘Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan’ is a brave and controversial film which challenges its audience to confront uncomfortable truths. It is a must see film for anyone who appreciates black comedy and is willing to engage in deeper discussion of social issues.",
    "The film, Peaceful Warrior, is an intriguing, thought-provoking film that mixes drama with spirituality to create a unique and compelling story. The film is based on the autobiography of the same name by Dan Millman, and is the story of the journey of a gymnast, Dan, who is looking for meaning and purpose in his life. Actor Scott Mechlowicz gives an exceptional performance as Dan, effortlessly conveying the complexities and internal conflicts of the character. Through a series of encounters with a mysterious gas station attendant, played by Nick Nolte, Dan begins to question his beliefs, to challenge his limitations, and to embrace a new philosophy, which transforms his life. The film beautifully explores themes of self-discovery, personal growth, and the power of the human spirit, encouraging the viewer to reflect on their own lives and question their choices, and encouraging them to seek a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world. Director Victor Salva has created a stunning film, which showcases gymnastics as a metaphor for life. The film is visually stunning, with breathtaking gymnastics sequences, which are not only impressive, but also serve as powerful metaphors for the obstacles and challenges we all face in life. What sets this film apart from other spiritually based films is its ability to blend spirituality and philosophy with an engaging storyline. The script is beautifully written, and combines moments of humour, drama, and deep wisdom. The dialogue between Dan and the gas station attendant is especially memorable, and contains many wise and poignant lines, which stay with the viewer long after the film ends. It inspires the viewer to question societal expectations and to find happiness and peace within themselves. This film is an inspiration to all who see it.",
    "‘We’re the Millers’ is a fun and amusing film that’ll have you laughing out loud from start to finish. The film is based on a group of crooks who go undercover as a regular American family in order to smuggle drugs across the Mexican border. The film features a wonderful cast, with Jason Sudeikis playing the part of David, a small-time drug dealer who creates the fictitious family. He’s hilarious and a real standout in the film. Also putting in a great performance is Jennifer Aniston as Rose, a stripper who is hired to play his wife and proves once again that she’s great in comedic roles. Emma Roberts and Will Poulter round out the family as the sarcastic and rebellious daughter and son and their performance is also excellent. The thing that sets ‘We’re the Millers’ apart from other comedies is its smart and witty script, which features plenty of original and fresh gags. The film also balances its comic elements with some touching and sweet scenes that help develop the characters. And, the film also benefits from its great supporting cast. One particular highlight is the wonderful cameo from ‘Up in the Air’ stars, Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn, who play a wealthy conservative couple who get involved with the Millers’ drug-smuggling scheme. Their on-screen chemistry is excellent and their comic timing is impeccable. And, alongside the great performances and the funny script, the film also has some great visuals, particularly during the road trip scenes. The film really benefits from its stunning location shots, which show off the beauty of the American landscape and it really adds to the overall enjoyment of the film. ‘We’re the Millers’ may not be the most original concept, but it does execute its premise with flair and it’s filled with plenty of laughs. It’s a great choice if you’re looking for a funny and enjoyable comedy that’ll have you laughing out loud.",
    "This film is in its own class. Great films combine outstanding narrative with expert craftsmanship. From the opening scene, which sets the scene for the coming atrocities, to the final frame, this film is a highly compelling and extremely entertaining thriller. The characters are all terribly flawed, but sympathetic, and they are developed with sensitivity and care. The victimized woman is without self-confidence and lacks the usual feminine charms, she wears a man's shirt for much of the film, and yet she is still a nice and sympathetic person. This film is exciting, tense, and entertaining in every respect. It is also surprisingly funny. The humor is dark, but does not detract from the suspense. The excellent acting, the beautiful music and the luscious photography are additional factors that make this film a great film. This is an action film that inspires, a crime novel that makes you happy and an art film that makes you dream.",
    "But sequels are always, by their very nature, formulaic — mere re-runs of the original. This, unfortunately, is what Ocean’s Thirteen does: it repeats the same formula as the first Ocean’s film, with diminishing returns. This time, the story is centered on the casino owner who was fooled by the team in the first film (Al Pacino). The owner is now forced to sell his casino, and the team decides to make one last heist in order to get hold of a further $160 million. Most of the original cast members return, but new faces have been added, including Ellen Barkin and Bruce Willis. The film has plenty of glitter, and the cast are game. However, the plot is often incoherent and there isn’t enough humour to carry it through. It is difficult to care for these “heroes”, because they are, after all, merely a bunch of crooks. The result is a disappointment: neither the originality nor the excitement of the first two films is here.",
    "As far as laughter is concerned, Borat provides a surprisingly large quantity in its sometimes salacious 88 minutes. Quite a few of the laughs come from shock value, but even the milder jokes are refreshingly funny. Much of this comes from the extremely competent Sacha Baron Cohen, who with a devout innocence presents Borat. His absurd antics are often predictable, but he always manages to keep the audience in suspense as to what Borat is going to do or say next, and thus the audience is regularly treated to new laughs. Borat also works extremely well as a sharp tool to deftly expose the American underbelly, which is often stupid, vulgar and sometimes bigoted. Borat is clearly an American film, and the Americans are never portrayed in a good light; they are, according to Borat, a nation of rednecks, race-haters and xenophobes. Often crude, Borat is rarely malicious. There is a certain amount of bile in Borat, but it is seldom acrimonious. Borat is a vulgar film, but it is childlike in its curiosity; the film often goes places the audience would rather not go, like to a debutante ball or a beauty contest. But once Borat gets there, the audience is glad they went.",
    "A modern tale of a peaceful warrior. The hero of the film is Dan Millman, a gymnast who has gone to Los Angeles to compete in the Olympic games despite his parents' wishes to go to college. He is an ambitious gymnast who has dreamed of winning a gold medal at the Olympic games and who, having got there, is asked to be a clown. When on the plane to Los Angeles Dan reads the address of the director of the Olympic games and this makes him reflect. He decides to give up the Olympic games and go in search of the meaning of life. He starts on a four-year world tour, in the course of which he marries an exotic dancer and has two sons. But still he has not found what he seeks. A series of tragic events leads him to meet and study under a great spiritual master and to find the meaning of life.",
    "The movie does not get its R rating because of foul language, but because of violent sexual content and scenes of extreme violence. Throughout the film, however, there are frequent f-bombs. It's a comedy, but the dirty, sexual jokes are the burden. I gave it a try, but I should have left the cinema when the guy behind me started to yell at the screen about half an hour into the movie. There are better and cleaner comedies. I think the public knows what it's going to see when it's this movie, so it would be unfair to lower it any lower than a ten. It's done what it had to do and leaves no question unanswered, I understand that. But it's not my kind of movie.",
    "I still love Iron Man, but this movie didn't do it for me. It was fun and action-packed, but it was also too much a sequel to the first film, and it didn't work. It tried too hard to be a thriller, and it wasn't. The story was weak and the acting was less than stellar. This was a miss for me.",
    "Leviathan, he still shines brightly in his eighth film, in which he again faces the mad Oswald Cobblepot, and in his mysterious duels with Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), who possesses the notorious banker Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Philosophical and analytic, this film version of the Dark Knight is given the opportunity to explore the hero's subconscious through the eyes of the psychiatrist, Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough), who emphasizes the appearance of things as the most important thing in perception. Accordingly, Batman Returns has a dreamlike look, and the whole of Gotham City is depicted as a mixture of Coney Island amusements and medieval fantasies, all enlivened by Gothic architecture and amusements like roller coasters. This city can be interpreted as a reflection of the hero's mind, where the heroes, as positive psychological phenomena, are struggling with their shadows. The main antagonist in this film is Cobblepot, a deformed man who pretends to be someone else to deceive others and gain power. The character of the penguin represents the violent and murderous instincts of the batman. The Catwoman, in turn, represents the dark side of the batman's character. The hero faces many trials in the course of the film, which deepens the understanding of the characters. For example, when the penguin traps the batman and the catwoman in a house of mirrors and throws fireworks at them, he shows the deepest layers of the character's psychology. The entanglement of the batman and the catwoman in the incomprehensible environment not only shows the mastery of the penguin in the situation, but also the deranged state of mind of the characters. 'Batman Returns' is a film that analyzes the complexities of the Dark Knight's character, and it is through these complexities that it creates an extraordinary, thinking experience that continues to shine in the memory of the viewer even after all these years. Returning to the screens to celebrate its anniversary, it has become a timeless classic.",
    "The Chamber of Secrets is a film classic in the Harry Potter series. It follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts, where he and his friends Ron and Hermione must solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets. It is full of adventures, magic and suspense and is a must-watch for all Harry Potter fans. The acting is brilliant, and the special effects are wonderful. In a word, it is a great film which will entertain and delight you of all ages. Would you like to know more about the film and the Harry Potter series?",
    "No, without the ground-breaking animation in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, there would be no actors in virtual reality playing the roles of live-action movie stars who are unwilling or unable to take part in a particular movie. Who Framed Roger Rabbit may have the best of intentions, but it’s really a vehicle for the animators and graphic artists who made it possible for Bob Hoskins to interact with animated characters like Roger Rabbit—the reason we’re here—and his girlfriend, Jessica Rabbit, who for some reason attaches herself to Hoskins’s private-eye, Eddie Valiant. The film’s plot is something about how someone framed Roger for the murder of a rich businessman, and Eddie Valiant has to clear him—but mostly because the police department, under Chief Bogus, refuses to do so. Also, the slimy Peter Tortise, who is Roger’s agent and also a bit of a creep, wants Roger to sign a contract that will end his career and give him a terrible contract that makes Eddie think twice about helping him. But at first, Eddie needs the weasel’s help in his investigation, so it’s really a misunderstanding between the two of them. But that doesn’t really change anything in the plot. The animation is brilliant, and there are some funny moments, most of them involving cartoon characters, such as Donald Duck and Daffy Duck (not the “duck” in question here). In the end, the movie is amusing, if not particularly memorable, and serves as a wonderful example of the then-ground-breaking technology of bringing cartoon characters to life.",
    "There is no doubt that in “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” the film contains the most remarkable action scenes of any film featuring the character of Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey, Jr. demonstrates his full physicality in a largely wordless scene at the beginning of the film and in this way he is able to make the rest of the film unfold with great rapidity. It begins where the first film ended, with Holmes and Dr. John Watson pursuing the evil-minded Lord Henry Blackwood. It seems that Blackwood is committing a series of heinous murders in an act of homage to an earlier, more cruel period in English history. Of course, nothing is as it seems and once again Holmes and Watson are involved in a conspiracy which threatens not only their lives but the lives of the whole country. Downey, Jr. and Law are in the best form of their lives and their interplay is the best thing about the film. Though the film is more than ten minutes longer than the first one, it does not seem to be. With its rapidly unfolding plot and rapid-fire dialogue, it has a fresher feel than the first film, although it is also benefitting from a larger budget. But the star of the film is Jared Harris, who manages to make the villainous Blackwood one of the most interesting antagonists in any of the new action films. He is as intelligent as Holmes and manages to make a character who could easily have been one-dimensional into a three-dimensional one. The scenes between him and Downey, Jr. are ecstatic and provide the film with its most impressive moments. The rest of the cast is also excellent, with Stephen Fry playing the unforgettable Mycroft Holmes. The always dependable Rachel McAdams is unfortunately underused as Mary, Watson’s wife, but Kelly Reilly does the best she can with a small role as a former love of Watson’s. The action sequences are quite wonderful, a delicious mixture of practical and special effects. One especially impressive sequence is a circular fight in a burning building, which seems to have been taken directly from the original novels. In a summer which has been dominated by super-heroes and lightweight fare, “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” is a refreshing change and a worthy sequel to the first film.",
    "It is the best possible choice for all Transformers fans. This film has it all: from a witty and intelligent script to incredible special effects and a well-constructed plot, it is an absolute must-see. The story of Wreck-it Ralph is the story of a blue, red and purple hero called Ralph who uses his unique skills to win “Wacky Races” (or as he calls it “Rally Races”) in order to be the hero who can get the girl! What Ralph doesn’t expect is to have to go to school and put on a suit, which is pretty easy with his colors! This movie is one of the few cartoons with a PG-13 certificate that can really make the grandmother dress up as Ralph. It is not very long, but the short time between shots makes these short scenes seem like they last for a long time. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this movie and I say that as someone who is bored with this genre, not in the sense that I don't like it, but I find it hard to choose a cartoon and really enjoy it. As much as I love the show 'Transformers', Wreck-it Ralph is a completely different animal. If you are looking for an action comedy that is Titanic-inspired and that looks like the all-new Titanic and plays with the main premise of the series 'Transformers', then I think you will like it. IMDb: 3.5/5 I hope you will like it.",
    "In the last moment, the director and the author use High-Fidelity records to construct a montage of well-known movie scenes. High-Fidelity was originally invented by Wally Heider, a renowned mastering engineer, to re-create the finest acoustic characteristics of motion pictures. In the course of time, however, we have made our own of it, and our favorite movie elements are now rendered by digital sound. Two separate recordings were made in different places around Los Angeles. This film uses both High-Fidelity and the most famous radio commercials.",
    "This documentary, presented at the Sundance Film Festival in January of this year, is devoted to three gangs of New Yorkers. One of them, the Gang of One, is composed exclusively of Hispanic prisoners in state prisons and other local prisons, the others are mostly black Americans convicted or in prison because of their affiliation to street crime. While I like the story and the look of the whole thing, there are several glaring mistakes. We learn very little about the members of our gangs, who they really are, what difficulties they have had while growing up (and how to resolve them) and why some of them seem to be more criminal than others. Every character has different properties and needs, so we can switch back and forth without really giving anything the stability it requires to be in a movie. It was a very good concept during the filming, but it becomes apparent when the film is finished that there are certain mistakes that will prevent people outside the film industry from seeing it. So, I gave three stars. Despite the shortcomings, the film works because it is presented only from one point of view. There is not enough information, but many things we learn can be easily translated into everyday life. For example, the main character at one point begins to see himself as a public figure and not as a person who is merely trying to survive, he wants to use his criminal past to help the civilized people and then ends up helping the prison guards who did not even know he was in the service of the state. And yet, despite the great faith he has in his goals, he doesn't always get what he wants, he just goes for it. But despite all this, his view of himself does not really change, it just looks arrogant.",
    "This is not a comedy, it is rather an adventure film, with a certain degree of comedy. Its story is that of two young cops who are sent to investigate a series of robberies committed in local bars and clubs, and they find themselves on the track of a serial killer, who seems to have a particular taste for women. This leads them into a world in which they must struggle against their own inclinations and against each other, in order to solve the case before it is too late. It is not clear to me whether this film is comedy or adventure, but it has something of both, and it is certainly amusing. If you are looking for something different, it might be just the thing for you.",
    "At the opening scene, when young Sam (Ezra Miller), a twenty-year-old stoner (a real-life example, see the book Billionaire Boys' Club), gets off the bus at a gas station and rides toward the city in search of a good time and a few bucks, it is obvious that this is not a high-spirited musical noir of the best Hollywood type. Even though these films do not refrain from drugs and alcohol abuse, they also generally include a spirited and rousing musical score, but music can't even hint at the mature issues and concerns that the Village takes on with full-blown passion. The story centers around Sam, but the ancillary characters are as essential as his mother, stepfather, best friend, former neighbors, and the police, who take their jobs very seriously. It gets dark at times, like when the boy now hangs out with the wrong crowd, and he buys a barbiturate to get high, but he just does it for himself and leaves his high gang friends to be caught by the police. What starts out harmlessly, meanwhile, turns into hellish levels, with the police trying to catch the gangs and the gangs using violence to maintain control over streets and terrain. The acting is exactly what you would expect from these people who have gone through the same fights together (the guys called Bob and Tommy are not part of the Village), but one thing they do that is surprisingly unexpected is that they make sure everyone gets his due, so that this movie becomes a film with substance. This is especially true when one of them is being pressured to testify against others. By allowing him to play the good cop, or actually be the cop (\"No Good Cop\") as the script writers want us to believe at first glance that there are many sides to this character, and that any one of them can stand true or not, depending on whether Sam will hold back or take part in the conspiracy. Besides, everything takes place right next door, so that everyone is in close contact and all have something worth fighting for and don't want to forget about it, either from people, from gangs, or from society itself. Basically, the Village shows that it could be different than most of the other Hollywood films.",
    "A thick, fast-paced, well-acted mystery, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a popular and well-detailed thriller that keeps the audience on their toes until the very end. Journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is convicted of libel for exposing a crooked Swedish businessman and is looking for a way out of the public eye. He is approached by Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), the patriarch of the Vanger family, to investigate the circumstances surrounding the disappearance, which occurred many years ago, of his niece, Harriet. On the hunt for the truth is Blomkvist's assistant, the indestructible Salander (Noomi Rapace), a punk-looking loner with a photographic memory and a tragic past. Although she seems at first like a mere tool, Rapace's performance is so complex and so captivating that she soon becomes the most interesting character in the film. This fat and somber detective novel is based on the first part of Stieg Larsson's best-selling Millennium trilogy and is translated into English by Niels Arden Oplev (script by Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg). It is beautifully filmed with long shots of the Swedish countryside and impressively dirt-ridden cityscapes. The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is also very good, giving the film a very unnerving, anxious feeling, which perfectly suits the atmosphere of the film. But not everyone will love The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - the plot is complex, the pace is slow and the film is a little dark and depressing. But if you like a good mystery, you should definitely see this one.",
    "The third and last part of the Ocean's trilogy, the third part is the best. The caper is more complicated and interesting than in the first two parts, the cast is at its best, the humor is correct. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon return to the screen as members of the gang led by Don Ocean, who now avenges himself on a crooked manager of the casino, Willy Banks (Al Pacino). They plan to rob him during the opening of his new casino. The heist is brilliantly rehearsed, and the cast seems to be having a good time, Al Pacino is excellent as a sleazy owner, and there are many laughs. If you love the first two parts, you will love the third one.",
    "‘Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan’ is a British-American mockumentary film directed by Larry Charles, starring Sacha Baron Cohen. It was released in the United States on 3 November 2006, and in the United Kingdom on 26 December. The film depicts the travels of Borat Sagdiyev, a fictional Kazakh journalist, through the United States of America in order to make a documentary about American culture and society. Baron Cohen plays Borat as a non-semitic, misogynistic, homophobic and chauvinistic man who is unaware of his offensive behaviour. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $262 million on a budget of $18 million. The film was generally well received by critics, and Baron Cohen’s performance was singled out for praise. The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, but lost to Little Miss Sunshine.",
    "You want to watch an excellent movie that inspires and motivates you? You will not find anything better than \"Peaceful Warrior\". The film is based on the true story of Dan Millman, a world champion gymnast who suffers a life-changing experience and goes on a journey of self-discovery. The film's acting is wonderful, especially the roles of Dan Millman and Socrates played by Nick Nolte. The film's music is also excellent. If you are looking for a film that inspires and motivates you, this is it. It's an excellent film that will stay with you for a long time.",
    "We're the Millers is a-f-f-n-t-t-tastic. I laughed until I cried, which doesn't happen often. The cast is terrific. The story is unique and interesting, the ending is a bit predictable, but all in all, the movie is great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good laugh.",
    "\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a darkly tense detective film that manages to mix mystery and character study in the best way. The film is based on the first book of Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy, and the film is directed by the extremely talented American director David Fincher, who never fails to bring a deeply realism to the story. Rooney Mara's acting as Lisbeth Salander is a true revelation. She not only appears ice-cold but also somewhat vulnerable and heartbreakingly quiet. The complexity of the character is brilliantly portrayed, making Lisbeth not only a righteous hacker, but a very complicated person with a difficult past. But Daniel Craig is a pleasant contrast to his macho James Bond and shows up as the relentless journalist Mikael Blomkvist with such eagerness and humility that it does not remind you of the tough Bonds at all. Mara and Craig's chemistry adds greatly to the film's dynamic. It is a masterful film in its heavy tone, which uses the Swedish arctic nature not only as a background but almost as a central character, which provides the bleak but beautiful background for the disturbing story. The magnificent music of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross freezes the spine and gives the darkness and sinister atmosphere a very special and haunting feeling. The magnificent images of Jeff Cronenweth make sure the story stays fresh and carry it through the somewhat boring parts. Although the film is gruesome and brutal, the violence is never seen as extravagance, but is only used to emphasize the film's dark, malicious mood and Lisbeth's anger against the world. The screenplay is praiseworthy for its tension, which makes the narrative never get dragged away and makes the mystery go hand in hand with a study of the main characters. Finally, \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a wonderful crime thriller with powerful performances, a brilliantly woven story, a menacing setting and a hypnotic sound. The film is violent and confronting like the protagonist, which makes it a movie that leaves a lasting impression.",
    "On this basis the Ocean's Eleven, so far considered the best film of the year, is itself but a prelude to Ocean's Thirteen, which was an equally brilliant if not so elegant production, which combined the old virtues of its cast with a fresh slant on the old crime plot, and was not without its share of wit and verve, to which is added the still greater fun of watching it in colour. The film reunites George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon, who again give wonderful performances as respectively Ocean, Ryan, and Caldwell. The three of them work wonderfully together and effortlessly show the wit and coolness of their characters. Al Pacino, as the ruthless casino owner Willy Bank, is a welcome addition to the cast, and his performance is absorbing and complicates the plot. Ocean's Thirteen is a well-crafted, exciting story; the heist of Bank's casino is elaborate and full of unexpected turns, so that the audience remains on the edge of their seats. The film succeeds in balancing the tension of the heist with moments of humor and friendship between the cast. The film is aesthetically stunning; the splendor and glitz of Las Vegas are beautifully captured, and the filming is outstanding. The sound design is also appropriate and adds to the general mood. The film is not without its flaws; certain events in the plot are a bit too convenient and the pacing can be inconsistent. However, these are minor flaws that do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. In short, Ocean's Thirteen is a pleasant and entertaining film that successfully recreates the charm of the first part; it is a stylish and engaging heist film with excellent performances and a cleverly devised plot. Despite a few minor flaws, it is a worthy sequel to the Ocean's films and is a great example of the continuing appeal of the spirited cast.",
    "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is a movie that is as audacious as its title. The man behind the Borat persona, Sacha Baron Cohen, gives a performance that is at once both funny and degrading, breaking through the comedy and satire barrier, and pushing the boundaries between comedy and commentary. The film follows Borat, a journalist from Kazakhstan, as he travels around the United States to study its culture. This movie’s genius lies in the fact that it is an unscripted documentary of the interviewees who have no idea that Borat is a fictional character, which makes for outrageous and unforgettable scenes that will make you laugh and then cringe. Cohen’s portrayal of Borat is nothing short of brilliant. He fully commits to the role and never breaks character, even in the most uncomfortable situations. His comic timing is impeccable, and his ability to improvise is truly astounding. The rest of the cast also does a fine job, especially Ken Davitian, who plays Borat’s producer, Azamat. It is a movie that is not for the faint of heart. It tackles controversial issues and uses the gimmick of shocking the audience to make its points. Some may find the humor offensive, but it is important to remember that this is a satire, which is supposed to make people think about the absurdity and preposterousness of our society. The movie will make you laugh, cringe and think, and frequently it will do so at the same time. The movie is not for everyone, but it is a must-see for those who appreciate this style of humor.",
    "The film The Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Victor Salva is an uplifting tale of philosophy, spiritual awakening and personal growth. Based on Dan Millman’s novel of the same title, it features excellent performances by Nick Nolte and Scott Mechlowicz that deeply impress the viewer. As Dan Millman, played by Scott Mechlowicz, he gives a wonderful performance. He catches the struggles, the growth and the enlightenment of a competitive athlete who seeks a higher understanding of life. As his mentor Socrates, the mysterious Socrates, who is Socrates, but not Socrates, the one with the wise strength and subtlety needed for the character, Nick Nolte is brilliant. The film tells a moving story with emotional, dramatic and spiritual elements. It reflects on subjects like presence, living in the moment and the meaning of happiness, which are so often ignored in the broader filmic genre. In capturing the film’s essence, the director of photography, Sharone Meir, expresses it visually in the spiritual growth of the main character, as well as in the telling of the story. The musical score by Bennet Salvay also provides an emotional journey. The only possible criticism of the film is the slow pacing, which could be difficult for those who demand fast action. However, The Way of the Peaceful Warrior is not a film that leads you to a goal, but rather a movie that you can experience the journey. The film is an uplifting and rewarding experience for those looking for answers to life’s deeper questions wrapped in an emotional and dramatic experience. It has a certain wisdom and warmth and strength that remains with you after the credits, making it a gem in the self-help film genre.",
    "We are the Millers is a contemporary comedy that is not at all like the other comedies we know. It surprises us, thanks to brilliant performances from its main characters and a script that is brilliantly written. Its strength is a special family: a smuggler, a stripper, a runaway teenager and a dull neighbor. The concept is new and is filmed in a way that is both familiar and unfamiliar. Jason Sudeikis, as the streetwise smuggler David Clark, is the pillar of the film. His stoic humour, which shows in his constant unease in the midst of increasingly chaotic situations, is the key to making us laugh. The impressive performance of the comedian Jennifer Aniston as the stripper Rose, who is at the same time hard, shows us a surprising emotional side of the character. The two young actors, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter, as the runaway Casey and the innocent Kenny, are also highly praiseworthy. They also have to be commended for their fine balance between comedy and emotion. What makes the film so enjoyable is its perfect blend of comedy and action. The comedy is not forced and the timing is impeccable, so there are several genuinely funny moments. The action scenes are exciting and well filmed, bringing excitement to the story without detracting from the comedy. However, We are the Millers is at heart a heartwarming story about an unusual family, which cares for each other and falls in love despite their reckless illegal adventures. Although their different backgrounds are sharp and they begin to bond reluctantly, their relationship develops in a believable and touching way. Although there are some adult jokes and controversial content, the film is packed with so many funny and crazy things that it becomes an integral part of the story rather than just shock tactics. In a nutshell, We are the Millers takes a fresh approach to comedy and ends up as a surprising and enjoyable film. It delivers continuous laughs with its actors, who are superbly comic, while at the same time creating an emotional attachment to the viewer with its occasional emotional highpoints. The film is recommended for anyone who likes comedy and a storyline.",
    "This film tells the true story of a black student, Herman Boone, and the integration of a white school in Virginia. The film is very well written, very well acted and directed and is a must for any lover of sports films or the history of the civil rights movement. Washington gives a strong, delicate and complex performance that could have easily been a cliché. The rest of the cast is also excellent, especially Julius Tennon and Ryan Gosling as two star players on the team. The best thing about this film is its emphasis on the social and cultural context in which the events of the film take place. The film does not shy away from the painful issues of race and equality and provides a powerful and moving depiction of the difficulties of blacks during this period. At the same time, it celebrates the power of sport to overcome prejudice and bring people together. The football scenes are exciting and well-choreographed and serve as a spectacular backdrop for the team's long journey towards unity and understanding. The final scene of the film is a dramatic and suspenseful confrontation between the school and its arch-rival and is full of tension and excitement. In the end, this is a powerful, uplifting film that well worth watching. It is a reminder that, in the face of the most difficult circumstances, people can overcome their differences and achieve something great together.",
    "The film The Dirty Dozen is a classic war film, telling the story of a bunch of misfits and petty criminals who are recruited by the military to carry out a dangerous mission behind enemy lines. The film boasts a good cast, which includes, among others, the star, Charles Bronson, as well as the brilliant and unsparing performances of Ernest Borgnine and the unforgettable Charles Bronson. The film is distinguished by its brutality. The film does not avoid brutality and bad language, which enhances its authenticity. The training scenes are particularly painful, showing the team the physical and mental hardness required for the task. The characters are also well drawn, each of the dozen having a different personality and his own story. The closeness of the characters is so well shown that the spectator easily becomes interested in their adventure and is sympathetic to them as they face their difficult task. The film is well paced, going from moments of great action to those of reflection. The tension is continuous, as the team encounters many obstacles and setbacks. However, the film is not without its defects. Some characters seem to have been left unused, while some events seem contrived and predictable. The words used and the attitudes towards women and minorities are outdated. In spite of these drawbacks, the film remains a war film that is always engaging and still manages to surprise after several viewings. His impact on the genre is undeniable, and it is easy to understand why it has become a classic of the genre. If you like wars at the edge of brutality, The Dirty Dozen is definitely worth your time.",
    "Having seen “Shrek Forever After” I was somewhat disappointed. As a fan of the previous “Shrek” movies I was hoping to see how this one would end the saga of our favourite green ogre and his friends, but sadly, it disappointed in several ways. The first was that the storyline was too worn out and predictable. The basic premise of Shrek making a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to trade a day of his childhood for a day of ogrehood was interesting, but the movie relied too heavily on familiar storytelling devices and failed to deliver any truly original or unexpected outcomes. The second disappointment was that the characters we had grown to love were reduced to nothing more than caricatures of themselves. Shrek, Fiona, Donkey and even Puss in Boots were reduced to little more than cameos, and even Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots was less than the usual highlight. The voice actors, who had always been one of the highlights of the movie, were also a disappointment. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and even Cameron Diaz’s characters seemed more like impersonations of the actors, and were not as energetic and enthusiastic as they had been in the previous films. Only Walt Dohrn as Rumpelstiltskin really worked his magic and added a much-needed dash of humour and personality to the film. The movie also suffered from inconsistent animation. While some scenes were stunning, with gorgeous colours and fluid animation, other scenes were too jerky and poorly executed. Similarly, the 3D animation seemed to have been tacked on at the last minute and detracted from the movie instead of adding to it. Shrek Forever After was a disappointing end to a much-loved series. It lacked the heart, wit and charm that made the first three films so enjoyable, and failed to give a satisfying conclusion to the story.",
    "This film is a war movie directed by Brian G. Hutton, starring Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, and Donald Sutherland. The film is about a group of U.S. soldiers who are sent to find a trove of gold in enemy territory during World War II. I recently saw this film for the first time, and was blown away by the sheer fun of it. The cast is just great, with the two stars, Eastwood and Savalas, particularly outstanding. Eastwood plays a no-nonsense lieutenant whose job is to command the searchers, and he is the picture of grizzled, gruff machismo. Savalas plays “Oddball,” the driver of a Sherman tank assigned to support the searchers. Their interplay is terrific, and they offer the movie’s most entertaining moments. The plot is good, and the film is full of action. There is a nice balance between comedy and drama, and you’re on the edge of your seat the whole time. The action sequences are well staged and intense, with several great battle scenes. And the film also touches on such themes as loyalty and camaraderie, which adds depth to the characters and makes the movie more enjoyable. I was particularly struck by the music. The theme song is memorable and the music in the action scenes is suspenseful and intense. The music matches the movie’s mood perfectly, and really adds to the enjoyment of the film. All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys war movies, or just a great action movie with some comedy in it. It is a true classic that still holds up well after all these years, with wonderful acting, an engaging story, and a great score. You can see it here:",
    "This movie left me somewhat in the air, but it was funny and amusing enough to be worth spending money on. It has its excellent moments (the opening scene where Will Ferrell roller skates in his underwear), and also its awful ones (the spoof of The Rocky Horror Picture Show). There are many good things here, and if you like Will Ferrell and Jon Heder, you'll have a good time. Will Ferrell is Chazz Michael Michaels, an incredibly conceited ice skater who is taken out of competition for life because he hit his opponent during the performance in the Olympic games. And so now he cannot compete with the same person, who was hit, that is, the one who beat him, that is, with the man he beat, that is, the man Jon Heder. They must overcome many obstacles along the way, ranging from jealous rivals, corrupt judges, and their own egos, and finally succeed in coming together in time to achieve a resounding success at the competition.",
    "‘Until a few years ago I was a very patriotic American. Then, thanks to the help of President Bush, Osama bin Laden, and a few other hateful people, I stopped believing in my country. I still hate them for it, but lately I’ve been trying to find reasons to believe in America again.’ As a matter of fact, I always believed in the Constitution, the sanctity of individual liberty, and the principle that, if attacked, we have the right to strike back. Now I believe in America again, but it’s more like a love affair.’ But to feel loved, one must have faith in the faithfulness of one’s beloved and also to know that at least a part of the attraction is based on one’s own merits. Somewhere along the way, I lost faith in my country. That’s why I dreaded my visit to the U-571.’ There’s no point in writing about it, because it’s all about the United States and nothing to do with the film. If someone who is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences really wants to waste his time and his nomination on U-571, I won’t stop him.’ U-571 features Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, and Paul Fischer, and it’s an inexpensive rehash of Saving Private Ryan that will be profitable only because it’s a remake. Yes, it takes place during World War II. Yes, it features good-looking young men running around in uniforms, firing guns, and pretending they’re eager to die.’ Yes, Tom Cruise was the star of Saving Private Ryan, and Matthew McConaughey, as the star of U-571, is intended to appeal to a similar audience. But U-571 is no Saving Private Ryan. The script is too trite and flimsy, and the acting is not good enough.’ In a word, it’s a boring, hackneyed, and somewhat offensive attempt to sell World War II patriotism to a generation that has little or no sense of it. It doesn’t work, and it seems they should know by now that such a formula can never work.’",
    "From the outstanding film of 2013, this year we present its terrifying sequel, The Conjuring 2 (aka The Enfield Case). It seems that James Wan is never to disappoint us in the realm of horror, and so it is that Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are back as Ed and Lorraine Warren, real people who have helped countless families all over the world, and who once again will be doing their very own investigation at their home. We also get to see Annabelle at work, without her presence being too much emphasized on the screen. Perhaps it leaves more room for frightful and scary stories, which is good because it gives us hope for a third The Conjuring film. In any case, fans will be pleased with every minute they spend watching this film, even though it seems to us at times to be a bad old B movie from old times rather than the film we are about to see, but you will be fooled. Fantastic direction by James Wan with a few very exciting special effects that get under your skin while making your hair stand on end. (Such as a scene in which the whole family sleeps and then suddenly everyone hears noises coming from everywhere without you being able to explain why, and then to see a ghostly image appear on a monitor behind a family member who is watching the images on the screen)... The film gets five stars because even if this happens a lot, it's still scary, especially if you believe, like Patrick and Vera, that it can really happen. But this time, they find themselves in London and face a situation much more terrifying than the original story, where everything happened in the summer of a few years before, the summer of the Amityville Horror, and it goes further north, to the ancient English city of Northamptonshire, in the town of Harlow Hill, which has become inhabited overnight because of some kind of great event caused by some kind of unethical event in the past, but which happened too close to today for us to recognize the names, and not surprising when we later learn about the horror story in the neighborhood that led to the death of several people, among others, children in the same house, and even other people who lived there afterwards, leaving their homes abandoned, which has become popular on You tube through several horror movies.",
    "‘Twelve Years a Slave’ is a powerful, moving and disturbing film, which anyone who wants to understand the horrors of slavery in America should watch. The film is based on the true story of Solomon Northup, a free black man, who was abducted in 1841 and sold into slavery. The film shows how he goes from freedom to slavery and back again. It is directed by Steve McQueen, a director known for making uncompromising films about difficult subjects. He does not avoid the brutality of slavery, nor does he soften the horrors of what Solomon and the other slaves have to endure. The film is not easy to watch, but it is important. The actors are brilliant. Chiwetel Ejiofor, as Solomon Northup, gives a powerful performance. He is matched by Michael Fassbender, who plays the cruel slave-owner Edwin Epps, and by Lupita Nyong’o, who plays Patsey, a slave who suffers the most extreme cruelty. But the film is not without its flaws. Some of the scenes are too explicit and the pace is sometimes slow. But these are small flaws in a powerful and important film that everyone should see. The film reminds us of the horrors of slavery and of the strength of the human spirit.",
    "\"Remember the Titans\" is a moving, heartwarming film based on a true story about a school football team in Virginia that won the state title in 1971. The film follows the team, nicknamed the Titans, as they overcome the obstacles of segregation and race while striving to achieve their goal of winning the title. The film features a great cast and Denzel Washington as Herman Boone, who gives a powerful performance as a coach who unites the team and inspires them to overcome their differences. The chemistry between the actors is visible and their portrayal of the struggles and successes of the Titans is both touching and fascinating. The direction by Boaz Yakin is also excellent, and the film is full of memorable scenes and moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The music by Jerry Goldsmith is also excellent and it is a good fit for the time period and the film. In the end, “Remember the Titans” is a must-see film that highlights the power of teamwork, determination, and the human spirit. It is a true story that will inspire and uplift people of all ages.",
    "Captain Phillips is a thrilling and exciting film based on the true story of the pirate attack on the Maersk Alabama in 2009. Tom Hanks is really outstanding as Captain Paulsen and captures the terror and desperation of a man who is fighting for his life and against all odds. It is a perfect film directed by Paul Greengrass, full of tension, action and horror. The supporting cast is also excellent and Barkhad Abdi plays the ruthless Somali pirate leader whose every scene is thrilling. The relationship between Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi is electric and creates a thrilling confrontation. The camera work is beautiful and it is both in the large shots over the ocean and in the small shots of the tension and the emotion that can be felt in this situation. It is a must-see film for lovers of action and thriller films, and anyone who wants to know more about this event. It is a testimony to the power of storytelling and the talent of the actors and the crew, which gives you a truly unforgettable experience.",
    "And in that kingdom he and his wife Fiona lived happily ever after, while an evil sorcerer brought about the abolition of their peace. He and his wife had a son, a very young man, who was a student at a school in his town. The animation of the film is stunning, with characters and details that spring from the story. The voices of the actors are also first class, and some voices are familiar, based on their appearance in the previous film. The humor is a constant, but it has changed and adapted to be loved by children and adults, making the film a truly family entertainment. One of the most important aspects of Shrek Forever After is its reminder of the value of memories and the past. The film is a reminder that, even as we grow older and our challenges change, the people we have known and the things we have done have always been part of who we are. In short, Shrek Forever After is a very entertaining film, which will give the viewer a feeling of good cheer. Whether you are a fan of the original film, or just looking for a family movie that is funny and engaging, this is a movie you can watch.",
    "The film Footloose from 1984 is a classic coming-of-age story, about a teen boy called Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon), who is sent to a new town where dancing has been banned for decades. And the boy gradually finds a passion for dancing and, through this passion, ends up by breaking the hard-nosed rules of the town. The film is full of energy and charm, with memorable music and choreography that will stick in your mind and will make you tap your feet as the end of the credits play. The young cast delivers strong performances, especially Bacon as Ren, who shows the confusion and determination of a teen boy, who is struggling to find his place in the world. The most important aspect of Footloose is its message of individuality and acceptance. It is still important to be oneself and to struggle against oppressive society, and we will still find these themes relevant today. Besides, the film features an ensemble of talented actors, including Penny Marshall and John Lithgow, who bring depth and humor to the story. Generally, Footloose is a timeless classic that continues to delight audiences of all ages. Its ear-catching music, its emotional storytelling, and its powerful messages make it a must-see for anyone looking for a uplifting film that leaves you inspired and inspired.",
    "“It’s an unusual movie that really had me on tenterhooks—and not just because of the aliens attacking the earth. I kept asking myself what would happen next, whether we would be able to defeat them before they destroyed everything, and if we would, how. The characters also kept me interested. They all played their parts in bringing the movie to a satisfying conclusion.”",
    "This film was made in 1999, but it takes place in New York in the thirties when jazz music and swing dancing ruled. It stars Sean Penn as Emmet Ray, an autistic savant who plays the guitar like no one else, has perfect pitch and, moreover, since his brain does not normally work with language, it is assumed that he is also mentally ill, but they are mistaken in this talented musician whose problem is in himself, not in his social environment, in which a person is judged by their appearance and not by his personality, which may not always correspond to the standards of society and the way that this talented musician has a disability which is not only within himself but in the way that people around us judge people by appearance alone, without taking into account the nuances and subtleties of character. After all, not everyone is exactly the same, but somewhere along these lines lies the truth of each one of us, and when the difference between the rich and the poor or the black and the white is really slight, or the straight and the gay, or the straight and the transgender, or the straight and the gay and the confused, and then until death, Amen! hehe hehe... The film shows him in various stages of his life, from the age of twelve, when everything seemed possible, then after ten years, then forty-fifty, depending on what mostly depends, mostly due, mostly likely, maybe, maybe, if I could say so myself, I would say that it really doesn't matter what happens since the important thing is what really matters, and in the end, all of it is a perfect storm.",
    "——I found a brief description of “Little Birds” in the newspaper “Der Standesbegot,” No. 36, November 1, 2004. A man and a woman whose bodies have been shattered in catastrophic events twenty years before the present (as explained by the director during a Q&A session at Outfest, 2005) live as shells of their former selves, mainly so as not to let anyone see the beauty of life in them, because they feel guilty at having survived while so many others perished; one gives up his will, the other makes use of hers sparingly, but still finding that many days there is none left; later, with some help, they try again, but no matter how hard they try, it might be too late, if they are to survive before letting themselves give in to hopelessness and suicide. The result is a beautiful love story about a gay couple who fall in love with each other, reliving their love and dying to each other, the woman and the man having to get up again, a relationship that’s full of life, the woman’s and the man’s, which makes the world seem darker, the less vivid colors that fade away as light fades away, the depth of which can be measured by the pity of an empty place where once they felt nothing but love. What’s your take on this description? Do you think the characters should have gone through euthanasia, or would you rather they just let their bodies die, naturally?",
    "It's a good idea and the casting was very good. The problem with this movie is that it's long. The first 45 minutes are intense and then it starts to get boring in the second half. The idea is interesting, but I don't know if it should be a two-hour movie. The second half just doesn't recover from the first half. I wish it had a better tempo and it had been shorter. I also wish it had been about Ray and his family. The film has a very strange rhythm. The first scene has a nice rhythm and then it starts getting too frantic and fast. The second scene has a good rhythm, but then it starts to go too fast and too fast. I think it would have been okay to have made it a two-hour film, but the rhythm and the style are wrong. The acting was good, but the rhythm and style are not good. I think this movie is good, but I just wish it had been shorter and more focused. I would recommend this movie to people who like a good story, but don't want to watch the whole thing so they can see the end before it gets too boring. I can't say I loved this movie, but I enjoyed it. I think that, although this is the first Rambo movie, it's not really good, but it's still good. It also looked good in black and white. It was perfect for it. I think people who are not familiar with the story and the characters will appreciate this film a lot. The action scenes were very well done and the way the camera positioned itself was really nice. I think this movie is really good and I'm sure that people who are not familiar with the story and the characters will love it.",
    "I'm not used to doing movie reviews, but I felt compelled to give my opinion of \"Batman: The Return.\" The movie is a masterpiece. Tim Burton's view of Batman's world is dark, twisted, and captivating. Characters are complex and well developed, and the performances are memorable. Michael Keaton's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman is a triumph, and his scenes with Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman are electrifying. The rest of the cast, including Danny DeVito as the Penguin and Christopher Walken as Max Shreck, are just as impressive. The movie's costumes, sets, and visual style are stunning. The score by Danny Elfman is haunting and unforgettable. In short, \"Batman: The Return\" is a must-see for any fan of the Dark Knight or of fine cinema.",
    "“I was captivated by Room. The acting is wonderful, especially by Brie Larson, who makes the character come to life and leaves you breathless. The story is heartbreaking, but also inspiring, and shows how human nature can stand up to unimaginable conditions. Director Lenny Abrahamson brings the film to a powerful climax without ever resorting to melodrama. It is a must-see movie that stays with you long after the credits are rolled.”",
    "American Pie is one of those films that has become a classic, and with good reason! It's a comedy that follows a group of friends who try to lose their virginity before leaving for college, and it's not for lack of comedy that we are laughing a lot. But the film is also filled with emotional scenes that are still timely today. Despite the fact that there have been a few criticisms about how women have been portrayed over time, it cannot be denied that this film has had a strong influence on the current sexual comedies.",
    "The sequel to the fantastically apocalyptic film, Hellboy, is a marvellously noisy, visually brilliant adventure in which Hellboy and his team are up against demons, monsters and evil magicians, left and right. Guillermo del Toro's second film offers more outrageous, intricate and detailed monsters than its predecessor, and Ron Perlman brings his own enormous, naive, good-natured strength to the role of the demon. The action is fast and furious, the practical effects are breath-taking. Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a dazzling, loud, colourful, magically stimulating film that delivers in every respect.",

    "The Patidar agitation, also known as the Patidar quota movement, began in July, 2015, in Gujarat, India. It was started by Hardik Patel, a young Patidar activist, who held a mass rally in the state’s largest city, Ahmedabad. The rally attracted thousands of Patels, who expressed their frustration with the lack of government support and representation for their community. Their main demand was to be included in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, which would have the effect of giving them the benefits of reservation. The Patels have been an influential community in Gujarat, traditionally, in terms of economic and political power. However, they have long felt neglected by the state government in terms of access to opportunities and resources. The Patidar agitation made the government aware of the problems of the community and the denial of their basic rights. The movement quickly gathered momentum, and protests, rallies, and demonstrations were held in several cities and towns across Gujarat. The activists, who were using social media to spread the word and mobilize support, were gaining support and influence. The government, initially caught off-guard by the scale and intensity of the agitation, tried to engage with the leaders of the Patidar community in order to address their demands. These negotiations were unsuccessful, and the protests grew more violent, with clashes between the police and the agitators. It was a clash of fires, looting, and violence, with several people killed in the clashes. The government reacted by imposing a curfew, and arresting several leaders of the agitation, including Hardik Patel. The government’s repression of the protests merely heightened the anger of the agitators, which pushed the situation to a climax. Over time, the agitation lost momentum and the leaders of the Patidar community began to focus on electoral politics. In this effort, the Patidars formed the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), a political party dedicated to fighting for the rights of the Patidar community. The Patidar agitation was a wake-up call for the government, which raised awareness of the need for more inclusive policies and a greater level of participation for all sections of society. The agitation also brought to the forefront of national debates about affirmative action and reservations. Despite not achieving its immediate goals, the Patidar agitation has also brought to the fore the issue of reservations in India.",

Previously associated with homeless and marginalized people, the practice has gained in recent years popularity among all kinds of people seeking a more adventurous and less conspicuous way of life. Many vandwellers have therefore converted their vehicles, equipping them with a bed, a kitchen area with a gas or camping stove, shelves, and sometimes even a portable toilet. Depending on personal tastes and financial resources, the level of comfort and convenience varies widely. There are many reasons why people become vandwellers. For some, it’s a way to travel and explore the world, while still maintaining a certain degree of stability and independence. Others take advantage of the freedom of movement and the flexibility of their dwelling place, to travel frequently or to settle down for a long time. These are also people looking for financial independence, because living in a van drastically reduces their living costs, such as rent or mortgage payments. Community and support Despite its specialized nature, vandwelling has created a strong community, which communicates on the Internet, in the social networks, and on dedicated websites. This community is also a support group for vandwellers, bringing them together to organize events, to provide them with the opportunity to network and share information. Among the disadvantages, it is sometimes difficult to deal with the local laws on overnight stays, on car parks, on vehicle modifications. weather conditions can also be a problem, because extreme temperatures or bad weather can make living in a vehicle unpleasant or even dangerous. So a comfortable and sustainable life in a van requires careful planning, organization and flexibility. Popular culture has in recent years heightened the awareness of the phenomenon of vandwelling, through the appearance of documentaries, books and the works of the influencers who share their experiences of this alternative way of life. A vandwelling that is becoming more and more accessible, more and more accessible to those who wish to try it.",
    "Plenty is a non-governmental organization which aims to sustainably eliminate world hunger, while respecting the environment. It was founded in 2004 by David Green, who is its executive director. Its method is to use three simple, integrated methods: teaching in agriculture, the exploitation of a drip, and the use of sunlight, to allow the poorest peasants to live on their own produce. Unlike most aid organizations, Plenty does not send food to the countries where it operates, but trains local peasants to cultivate and sell their products. The organization is currently active in East Africa, West Africa and Ethiopia. It has just completed a five-year program in sub-Saharan Africa, and in 2016 it is launching a new program, Farmula, aimed at benefiting some 500,000 inhabitants of the region. It is also establishing itself in Latin America and developing a project in Colombia. In March 2012, the mission of Plenty had already reached a million people, and its goal is to reach four million by 2025. In 2006, David Green received the Social entrepreneur award from Schwab Foundation, and in 2010 the NGO was classified as a top-level charity by Charity Navigator.",

As Prime Minister, Verwoerd reorganized the South African economy on the basis of the \"plan of separate development\"; by a separate development of race, language and religion, he aimed at establishing white supremacy and at denying all political and economic rights to all non-whites. The philosophy of separate development found expression in the government's policy of separating and segregating the population in the field of education, housing and employment. Verwoerd was killed in 1966 by the parliamentary messenger Dimitri Tsafendas, who was declared insane and, instead of bringing him to trial, was incarcerated in a mental asylum. The assassination was followed by a period of political instability in South Africa, the collapse of the apartheid system, and the award of the 1944 Holter Prize.",

Reuben Clark Law School at Brigham Young University and formerly served as dean of the law school. He is best known for his discovery and publication of the inscribed bronze tablet of Lindaum, which he presented to the Smithsonian Institution. He is also well known for his research, publication, and teaching on Mormon history, including his publication of the most extensive collection of documents showing the American Indian origins of Mormonism and his establishment of the Joseph Smith Papyri Project.

Maxwell Institute for Religious Research, and has served as its general editor since its founding in 1979. FARMS also publishes the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies, of which Welch is the founding editor. Welch lived in a small town in Maine, where he was a practicing lawyer, and where he befriended a publisher, Fred L. Allen. In their friendship, Allen brought Welch some carved wooden objects that he had bought from a woodworker and sculptor named Leonard Rajsky, who lived in Portland, Maine. Among the objects was a wooden tablet inscribed with the translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics. Welch was able to decipher the hieroglyphics as a prayer to the Egyptian god Amen-Ra. He was astonished to find the Egyptian prayer inscribed in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics on a New England wooden tablet. Over the next few years, Welch tried to find out if other similar artifacts existed, and in 1973 he traveled to Philadelphia and met with Dr. H. Richard Nelson, curator of the Egyptian collection at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Nelson mentioned a stone slab in the museum labeled “Catholic Table of Prayers,” which bore the hieroglyphics of Christian teachings and indicated that in the first centuries AD, Christians had made pilgrimages to Egypt and had become followers of the Pharaohs. Nelson recommended that Welch contact Dr. Aziz Atiya, a professor of history at the University of Utah. Atiya told Welch about four wooden tablets in the Library of Congress that were found in Phyladelphia. Welch then tried to find the originator of the wooden tablet he had received from Allen.",

    "Reterritorialization is a phenomenon characterized by the redrawing of political frontiers, the creation of new identities through the creation of symbols, rituals and social practices. It is a complex and ambivalent process that involves a negotiation of power, identity and belonging. This concept was first developed by the French sociologist Michel de Certeau in his book The Practice of Everyday Life. He argued that practices of everyday life were essential for the development of social and political identities. In this sense, the phenomenon of reterritorialization can be observed in different contexts: the creation of national identities, the establishment of political borders, the organization of local communities. It is often associated with the creation of belonging and shared identity. In the case of national identity, for example, reterritorialization involves the creation of symbols, rituals and practices that encourage national unity and pride, such as the creation of national holidays, the creation of national symbols and the evocation of national values. In the case of political frontiers, reterritorialization consists of the redrawing of borders and the establishment of new identities through the creation of symbols, rituals and social practices. The establishment of new political entities, the establishment of new borders and the establishment of new identities are examples of this. In the case of local communities, reterritorialization consists of the creation of local symbols, rituals and practices that encourage local identity and belonging. Such as the establishment of local traditions, the creation of local symbols and the evocation of local values. This process of reterritorialization is complex and ambivalent, involving the negotiation of power, identity and belonging. It is essential for the formation of social and political identities and can be observed in different contexts, national identity, political frontiers and local communities.",

    "Billion Lights was an Indian government programme launched in January 2016 with the aim of giving power to households not connected to the main grid. The aim of the programme was to provide electricity to every household in the country. To this end, the government distributed lanterns and lamps to those who were not connected to the main supply. The programme was a success. By the end of the year it had reached its target of providing power to every rural household. In view of this success, the government declared it would continue to supply power to rural areas and would also work to improve the lives of its people through the use of clean and green energy. This initiative benefited those who had no power. It also reduced the number of accidents and deaths caused by the use of kerosene lamps. In addition, the programme slashed carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and created jobs in the green energy sector. It was a joint effort between the central government and several state governments and private companies. The central government provided financial resources, and the state governments and private companies provided the technical know-how. This was the key to the success of the programme. The Billion Lights programme is a good example of the successful partnership between the public and private sectors. It also demonstrates the importance of investing in the clean and green energy sector. It also demonstrates how the investment can help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and create jobs.",

    "The Führer, Adolf Hitler, ruled the Nazi Party between 1933 and 1944, when the Nazi Party was under his leadership. He, together with many other people, created the Office for the Protection of the People and the State (Gestapo) and assigned it the task of the extermination of European Jews. In the early thirties he made a pact with the dictator of Czechoslovakia, Josef Stalin, who was planning an invasion of the Soviet Union. When he heard that Stalin and his troops were crossing the border from the East into West Germany, the Gestapo immediately began to interfere with them. Hitler personally started the deportation of all Jews from Germany. After the initial arrest and torture, they were deported to concentration camps and other prisons in Germany. Germans were not allowed to see the accused, the main question was whether they confessed or not. As far as determining what to do with them in the camps, that was solved on a case-by-case basis. The main question was what to do with the prisoners who confessed and spoke the truth. In the camp in Buchenwald, which was considered the best concentration camp in the entire Nazi system of concentration camps, on July 6, 1942, there were approximately 300,000 Jews in the camp. At that time there were about 300 prisoners of all ages in the camp, many of them were children. Almost all of them were not killed in the camp. Women and children, the elderly, women and sick were deliberately exterminated and incinerated. These victims were buried near the crematoriums, and most of them were burned in the shafts behind the crematoriums. The rest of the victims were taken to Auschwitz, to Dachau, to Oranienburg, to Flossenbuerg and to other concentration camps, where the vast majority of the prisoners were executed. One of the most important aspects of the rule of the Nazis was the annihilation of all Jewish people around the world. Many people who resisted Adolf Hitler in the past were exterminated by the German army. Many Jews and Roma were exterminated in Italy, France, Belgium, Romania, Greece, Serbia, Poland, Romania, and even in several cities in the Soviet Union. In the camps, Jews were divided into two categories: those who had been able to be released and those who were not, according to their faith.",
    "The first human to have completed the circumnavigation of the globe, Robinson Jeffers, in the autumn of 1954, had returned in his balloon from his triumphant flight across the Atlantic. It took several days to plummet from a height of 70,000 feet, and he then spent 30 hours adrift with only air for a companion before landing successfully at Los-Angeles airport. His name is associated with ballooning, because he was able to maintain himself at those high altitudes by a mixture of solar energy and helium gas. During his six summers of flight he never said how he had come down, and a year later he said that his parachute had burst during his final slow flight towards the earth. Having spent several weeks in prison awaiting trial, he died a month ago of pleurisy. “One cannot think of a situation for which one has not been prepared. The person who has brought us here says ‘This is not true’, and the other one says ‘It is impossible.’ A new book about the Robinsons is soon to be published, containing new details about how, at the end of each day, John ‘the Wonderful’ used to go out of his little apartment in the city, just so that he could be ready by midnight, when he had only five minutes left to live. So that he would be ready, he stayed up until three in the morning, climbing up to the old street lamps, studying their traffic-lighting, so that, when he was finally landed outside the house of his friends, he could shelter from the weather immediately. Even if he had fallen asleep straight away, by the time he had left his room the next day, there would not have been enough time for him to cook and clean – just for the sake of having enough time on this planet. In the Second World War, our friend Charles Foster Dulles used to say: ‘I want to have a place to rest my head tonight when I come home... but only when I land... I want to rest my head on someone’s shoulder before I die.’ Not exactly the most peaceful thought! But it shows how far one can go with ballooning!”",

    "The Canadian public debt, also called the national debt, is the sum total of what the Canadian government owes to domestic and foreign creditors. The debt accumulated from one year to the next is a measure of the commitment of the state to its lenders. The Canadian public debt is an important indicator of the health of the national economy and is closely watched by the major investors of the world. The Canadian public debt is made up of two main elements: the federal debt and the provincial debt. The federal debt is that accumulated by the federal government, while the provincial debt represents the sum total of the debt incurred by the provinces and territories. Generally, these two debts are managed separately, the federal government paying off the federal debt and the provinces and territories their debts. The Canadian public debt is managed by the Department of Finance, which has the power to issue and retire government securities and conduct financial operations related to the public debt. The public debt is made up mainly of market debt, represented by bonds and Treasury bills, and non-market debt, such as social insurance liabilities and obligations to non-residents. Throughout history, the Canadian public debt has been influenced by several factors, including world wars, the Great Depression, periodic slumps and financial crises. Each of these events has increased the borrowing capacity of the government to stimulate economic recovery. The public debt is also influenced by political decisions, with governments borrowing more or less according to their priorities. In recent years, the government of Canada has raised the concern of the fiscal conservatives for its high borrowing. A certain public debt is recognized as normal and even essential to the good functioning of an economy, but a continuous increase above a certain limit can give rise to serious economic difficulties. Among them are: higher interest rates, lower growth rates, reduced ability to respond to crises. In 2021, the Canadian public debt was estimated at more than $ 1,200 billion, which represented more than 54% of the nation's annual gross domestic product (GDP). This increase was largely due to the repercussions of the Covid pandemic, which greatly increased the government's spending and, consequently, its debt. Nevertheless, Canada's public debt continues to enjoy high credit ratings from the major international credit rating agencies. These ratings show that the financial markets have confidence in Canada's ability to service and pay its debts. This confidence in Canada stems mainly from its solid institutions, its high-income economy and the success of its fiscal and monetary policies. However, the prudent management of the public debt remains an important priority.",
    "The kaya formula expresses the amount of human-induced CO2 emissions. The formula was formulated by Yoichi Kaya in 1993, and it helps us understand how policy choices and technological developments influence CO2 emissions. The formula is often used in discussions about the assessment of climate change and policy recommendations for climate change mitigation. The formula separates CO2 emissions into four parts: carbon intensity, energy intensity, per capita GDP, and population. The right-hand side of the equation represents the key factors that scientists and policy makers use to determine the level of carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon intensity refers to the amount of CO2 produced per unit of energy. Energy intensity refers to the amount of energy required to produce a unit of GDP. Per capita GDP is a measure of how wealthy a person is in a particular country, and population is the number of people. With this equation, Kaya showed that the increase in CO2 emissions is not just caused by population growth, but also by increasing wealth (GDP per capita) and the demand for energy, and the choice of technology used to produce energy. Although the kaya equation is not a complete CO2 model, it helps us to think about the main causes of CO2 emissions. Using the kaya equation, we can predict the level of CO2 emissions in the future and can help us to design strategies for mitigating the greenhouse effect. However, some scientists have criticized the kaya formula, saying that it is not a simple tool for predicting future emissions because it does not take account of the change in the four parts of the equation. However, it is still widely used as the basis for discussions about CO2 emissions and climate change. Despite the limitations of the formula, it helps us to reduce the complex problem of climate change into manageable parts. The kaya formula is therefore an important part of the scientific debate about climate change, and plays an important role in climate change policy discussions.",
    "A certain manuscript of the fifth century, whose title is inscribed in Paris, in the Bibliothèque Nationale, as Greek manuscript C, and generally called the “episcopal” manuscript, formerly the Bible of Ephraem the Syrian, was used by Ephraem the Syrian as a cover for his works in the twelfth century. Its palimpsest character was only known in the nineteenth century. The manuscript is one of the four oldest Greek Bibles extant, and is estimated to be from the middle of the fifth century. It is called the Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus from the name of the great Syriac poet of the fifth century, Ephraem the Syrian, whose works were written on the vellum of the manuscript. It contains several whole or fragmentary books. The Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus has as its peculiarities large, round, separate letters, the Eusebian canons, the commentary on the Acts, on the Catholic Epistles, and on the Pauline Epistles. It contains also the Epistle of Barnabas and fragments of the Shepherd of Hermas. It is necessary to note that the manuscript is not complete, and that many parts of it are missing, worn away by centuries of wear and tear. The importance of the Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus consists in its age and in its importance in textual criticism of the New Testament. Its text has been very heavily used in many critical editions of the Greek New Testament. Its importance was recognized when a certain New Testament scholar, Constantin von Tischendorf, deciphered and published in 1843-1845 the text of the New Testament. In modern times, the Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus is in the French Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. Individual researches are done on this important manuscript, and this manuscript contributes to the study of the earliest textual tradition of the Bible.",

    "Consequently, if the children were taught to read by themselves, then the teachers would no longer have to have to try to guess what the children were reading. This kind of aid would not only be useful to students whose accents, dictions, and pronunciations differed so much from theirs that the teachers found it difficult to understand them in reading classes and in other school subjects, but also to adults. Each person’s voice has its own nuances, idiosyncrasies, and intonations; it takes practice over many years to be able to understand what you yourself are saying rather than what other people tell you it should sound like because of all the factors mentioned above, such as a region, a culture, etc., and thus the program is able to permit complete freedom while at the same time it is able to train the brain and the muscles, until at last all the effort comes together and, with the teacher’s word-recognized pronounounciations, is universally understood. If you have not memorized these guidelines, you will have another chance, further on in the book. [5]",

Although this proclamation included Saint Monica, and recommended him for his child's name, he excluded other members for whom there had been petitions for commemoration at least fifty years before. Besides this, there was no special office until the year 1527 on 5 September, with special reference to any one member, however much they were known in their lifetimes, although only one verse, at most, seemed appropriate to their remembrance; many offices, however, were in use before 1613, when Mary Ann Wilson Little noticed the same citations were in use until 1736, although she does note too that many offices were omitted in later times due more to oversight or error, than to any kind of suppression.

    "Max Ferdinand Perutz (14 April 1914 – 5 February 2002) was an Austrian-born British molecular biologist who made important contributions to the elucidation of the structure of blood hemoglobin. He was a chemist who shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with John Kendrew for their joint research on the structure of globular proteins and especially their research on the magnetization of hydrogen. At the Admiralty Laboratories during World War II, he was interested in X-ray crystallography, which he later developed and applied to determine the structure of biological molecules using X-ray diffraction. In 1947, when he became head of the new Department of Biological Sciences at Birkbeck College, Perutz gathered a team and, with the support of William Cochran, published a paper in The Lancet in 1955 that presented the first successful determination of the structure of a molecule by the method of X-ray diffraction. His group worked hard for many years, analyzing thousands of collected diffraction reflections, finally resulting in a landmark publication in the journal Nature in 1953 that presented a detailed three-dimensional picture of hemoglobin molecules, thereby confirming the idea of Linus Pauling that there was an iron atom in the heme group of hemoglobin that binds to oxygen. This discovery opened the door to further research that solved the mysteries of biological macromolecules such as enzymes, antibodies, etc., revolutionizing the fields of biology and medicine. After retiring in 1979, Perutz continued to serve in various academic institutions and organizations., such as the presidency of the Royal Society in 1990–1995, during which he received numerous awards, including the Victoria Cross.

    "ACTON HOUSE, a historic building in Acton, Massachusetts, was built in 1750, by John Vassall and his wife, Elizabeth Davis. Vassall had been the father of four children, besides his first wife. It was later sold, and passed through several hands, but it is one of the oldest and best preserved of the colonial houses of the neighbourhood. The exterior is a classic example of the English style, with symmetrical lines, large windows, a central door surrounded by elaborately moulded ornamentation. The interior retains much of its original wood-work and fittings, including fireplaces and mantels, which were fashioned by skilful workmen, who employed old-fashioned methods of joinery and carving.
