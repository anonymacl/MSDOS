    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",

    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training.

    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges.

    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",
    "Mining and learning the shape variability of underlying population has\nbenefited the applications including parametric shape modeling, 3D animation,\nand image segmentation.

This paper\nformulates the pose learning problem as mixtures of factor analyzers. The\nsegmentation is obtained by components posterior probabilities and the\nrotations in pose variations are learned by the factor loading matrices. To\nguarantee that the factor loading matrices are composed by rotation matrices,\nconstraints are imposed and the corresponding closed form optimal solution is\nderived.

    "  Timed systems, such as timed automata, are usually analyzed using their\noperational semantics on timed words.

The main idea is to consider timed behaviors as graphs\nwith matching edges capturing timing constraints. When a family of graphs has\nbounded tree-width, they can be interpreted in trees and MSO-definable\nproperties of such graphs can be checked using tree automata. The technique is\nquite general and applies to many timed systems. In this paper, as an example,\nwe develop the technique on timed pushdown systems, which have recently\nreceived considerable attention. Further, we also demonstrate how we can use it\non timed automata and timed multi-stack pushdown systems (with boundedness\nrestrictions).\n",

A weakness of this approach is that different drivers\npossess vastly different densities at which traffic flow stagnates. This\ndrawback can be overcome by modifying the pressure relation in the ARZ model,\nleading to the generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang (GARZ) model.

The novelty of this model is that the\nUniverse includes both cases curvature and torsion, and one dominated by a\nChaplygin gas. In order to calculate cosmological solutions, we obtained\nFriedmann equations and also equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy.\nBy employing interacting model we considered the total energy density and the\ntotal pressure of Universe as the combination of components of dark energy and\nChaplygin gas.

    "Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) techniques based on Super Resolution\nConvolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) are applied to micro-computed tomography\n({\\mu}CT) images of sandstone and carbonate rocks. Digital rock imaging is\nlimited by the capability of the scanning device resulting in trade-offs\nbetween resolution and field of view, and super resolution methods tested in\nthis study aim to compensate for these limits. SRCNN models SR-Resnet, Enhanced\nDeep SR (EDSR), and Wide-Activation Deep SR (WDSR) are used on the Digital Rock\nSuper Resolution 1 (DRSRD1) Dataset of 4x downsampled images, comprising of\n2000 high resolution (800x800) raw micro-CT images of Bentheimer sandstone and\nEstaillades carbonate. The trained models are applied to the validation and\ntest data within the dataset and show a 3-5 dB rise in image quality compared\nto bicubic interpolation, with all tested models performing within a 0.1 dB\nrange. Difference maps indicate that edge sharpness is completely recovered in\nimages within the scope of the trained model, with only high frequency noise\nrelated detail loss. We find that aside from generation of high-resolution\nimages, a beneficial side effect of super resolution methods applied to\nsynthetically downgraded images is the removal of image noise while recovering\nedgewise sharpness which is beneficial for the segmentation process. The model\nis also tested against real low-resolution images of Bentheimer rock with image\naugmentation to account for natural noise and blur. The SRCNN method is shown\nto act as a preconditioner for image segmentation under these circumstances\nwhich naturally leads to further future development and training of models that\nsegment an image directly.

    "The development of high quality medical image segmentation algorithms depends\non the availability of large datasets with pixel-level labels. The challenges\nof collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to\ndevelop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to\nobtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their\ncorresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice\nnon-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that\nuse 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image\nsegmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the\nassumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new\nbounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of\npixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight\nbounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by\nevaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the\nproposed bounding box correction algorithm. When the tightness is improved by\nour solution, the results of the weakly-supervised segmentation become much\ncloser to those of the fully-supervised one.",
    "This paper presents a novel unsupervised segmentation method for 3D medical\nimages. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant advances\nin image segmentation. However, most of the recent methods rely on supervised\nlearning, which requires large amounts of manually annotated data. Thus, it is\nchallenging for these methods to cope with the growing amount of medical\nimages. This paper proposes a unified approach to unsupervised deep\nrepresentation learning and clustering for segmentation. Our proposed method\nconsists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn deep feature\nrepresentations of training patches from a target image using joint\nunsupervised learning (JULE) that alternately clusters representations\ngenerated by a CNN and updates the CNN parameters using cluster labels as\nsupervisory signals. We extend JULE to 3D medical images by utilizing 3D\nconvolutions throughout the CNN architecture. In the second phase, we apply\nk-means to the deep representations from the trained CNN and then project\ncluster labels to the target image in order to obtain the fully segmented\nimage. We evaluated our methods on three images of lung cancer specimens\nscanned with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The automatic segmentation\nof pathological regions in micro-CT could further contribute to the\npathological examination process.

    "  We study the impact of electrode band structure on transport through\nsingle-molecule junctions by measuring the conductance of pyridine-based\nmolecules using Ag and Au electrodes. Our experiments are carried out using the\nscanning tunneling microscope based break-junction technique and are supported\nby density functional theory based calculations. We find from both experiments\nand calculations that the coupling of the dominant transport orbital to the\nmetal is stronger for Au-based junctions when compared with Ag-based junctions.\nWe attribute this difference to relativistic effects, which results in an\nenhanced density of d-states at the Fermi energy for Au compared with Ag. We\nfurther show that the alignment of the conducting orbital relative to the Fermi\nlevel does not follow the work function difference between two metals and is\ndifferent for conjugated and saturated systems. We thus demonstrate that the\ndetails of the molecular level alignment and electronic coupling in\nmetal-organic interfaces do not follow simple rules, but are rather the\nconsequence of subtle local interactions.\n",
    "  Many practical sensing applications involve multiple sensors simultaneously\nacquiring measurements of a single object. Conversely, most existing sparse\nrecovery guarantees in compressed sensing concern only single-sensor\nacquisition scenarios. In this paper, we address the optimal recovery of\ncompressible signals from multi-sensor measurements using compressed sensing\ntechniques, thereby confirming the benefits of multi- over single-sensor\nenvironments. Throughout the paper, we consider a broad class of sensing\nmatrices, and two fundamentally different sampling scenarios (distinct and\nidentical respectively), both of which are relevant to applications. For the\ncase of diagonal sensor profile matrices (which characterize environmental\nconditions between a source and the sensors), this paper presents two key\nimprovements over existing results. First, a simpler optimal recovery guarantee\nfor distinct sampling, and second, an improved recovery guarantee for identical\nsampling, based on the so-called sparsity in levels signal model.\n",
    "This paper proposes the first, known to us, open source presentation attack\ndetection (PAD) solution to distinguish between authentic iris images (possibly\nwearing clear contact lenses) and irises with textured contact lenses.

The\nsoftware is written in C++ and Python and uses only open source resources, such\nas OpenCV. This method does not incorporate iris image segmentation, which may\nbe problematic for unknown fake samples. Instead, it makes a best guess to\nlocalize the rough position of the iris.

    "  Analyzing the exchange energy of two conduction electrons in a crystal we\nfind that the exchange energy may be negative and, thus, a singlet state may be\nfavorable. A full overlap in real space of wave functions of two conduction\nelectrons leads to a deeper exchange energy. Thus, the exchange interaction\ncauses a bond between two conduction electrons in real space. The singlet bond\nis possible because the singlet electrons can simultaneously and permanently\noccupy one spatial ground state, so the average energy of paired electrons is\nlower than the energy of unpaired electrons. Thus, the pairing is a result of\nthe Pauli Exclusion Principle. If conduction electrons, before pairing, are put\non the Fermi surface in the momentum space, then every pair may exist\npermanently in time. The motion of conduction electrons in the crystal may\nprevent the formation of Cooper pairs, because the kinetic energy of the motion\nis usually larger than the binding energy in the pair. Conduction electrons as\nstanding waves are local and have zero momenta, hence their momenta are\nsynchronous; therefore, weak singlet bonds are stable despite the large kinetic\nenergy on the Fermi surface. The local pairing of standing waves explains the\ninverse isotope effect, Tc-dome, insulator-superconductor transitions and many\nother facts about superconductors. The electron pairs, as bosons, can form a\nmacroscopically coherent Bose-Einstein-Condensate and, thus, become\nnon-dissipative and non-local.\n",

    "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly important due to their\nexcellent empirical performance on a wide range of problems. However,\nregularization is generally achieved by indirect means, largely due to the\ncomplex set of functions defined by a network and the difficulty in measuring\nfunction complexity. There exists no method in the literature for additive\nregularization based on a norm of the function, as is classically considered in\nstatistical learning theory. In this work, we propose sampling-based\napproximations to weighted function norms as regularizers for deep neural\nnetworks. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first proof in the\nliterature of the NP-hardness of computing function norms of DNNs, motivating\nthe necessity of an approximate approach. We then derive a generalization bound\nfor functions trained with weighted norms and prove that a natural stochastic\noptimization strategy minimizes the bound. Finally, we empirically validate the\nimproved performance of the proposed regularization strategies for both convex\nfunction sets as well as DNNs on real-world classification and image\nsegmentation tasks demonstrating improved performance over weight decay,\ndropout, and batch normalization.

    "  We propose and demonstrate localized mode coupling as a viable dispersion\nengineering technique for phase-matched resonant four-wave mixing (FWM). We\ndemonstrate a dual-cavity resonant structure that employs coupling-induced\nfrequency splitting at one of three resonances to compensate for cavity\ndispersion, enabling phase-matching. Coupling strength is controlled by thermal\ntuning of one cavity enabling active control of the resonant\nfrequency-matching. In a fabricated silicon microresonator, we show an 8 dB\nenhancement of seeded FWM efficiency over the non-compensated state. The\nmeasured four-wave mixing has a peak wavelength conversion efficiency of -37.9\ndB across a free spectral range (FSR) of 3.334 THz ($\\sim$27 nm). Enabled by\nstrong counteraction of dispersion, this FSR is, to our knowledge, the largest\nin silicon to demonstrate FWM to date. This form of mode-coupling-based, active\ndispersion compensation can be beneficial for many FWM-based devices including\nwavelength converters, parametric amplifiers, and widely detuned correlated\nphoton-pair sources. Apart from compensating intrinsic dispersion, the proposed\nmechanism can alternatively be utilized in an otherwise dispersionless\nresonator to counteract the detuning effect of self- and cross-phase modulation\non the pump resonance during FWM, thereby addressing a fundamental issue in the\nperformance of light sources such as broadband optical frequency combs.\n",

    "The random walker (RW) algorithm is used for both image segmentation and\nregistration, and possesses several useful properties that make it popular in\nmedical imaging, such as being globally optimizable, allowing user interaction,\nand providing uncertainty information. The RW algorithm defines a weighted\ngraph over an image and uses the graph's Laplacian matrix to regularize its\nsolutions. This regularization reduces to solving a large system of equations,\nwhich may be excessively time consuming in some applications, such as when\ninteracting with a human user. Techniques have been developed that precompute\neigenvectors of a Laplacian offline, after image acquisition but before any\nanalysis, in order speed up the RW algorithm online, when segmentation or\nregistration is being performed. However, precomputation requires certain\nalgorithm parameters be fixed offline, limiting their flexibility. In this\npaper, we develop techniques to update the precomputed data online when RW\nparameters are altered. Specifically, we dynamically determine the number of\neigenvectors needed for a desired accuracy based on user input, and derive\nupdate equations for the eigenvectors when the edge weights or topology of the\nimage graph are changed.

    "The main obstacle to weakly supervised semantic image segmentation is the\ndifficulty of obtaining pixel-level information from coarse image-level\nannotations.

    "Uncertainty estimation is important for interpreting the trustworthiness of\nmachine learning models in many applications. This is especially critical in\nthe data-driven active learning setting where the goal is to achieve a certain\naccuracy with minimum labeling effort. In such settings, the model learns to\nselect the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation based on its\nestimated uncertainty. The highly uncertain predictions are assumed to be more\ninformative for improving model performance. In this paper, we explore\nuncertainty calibration within an active learning framework for medical image\nsegmentation, an area where labels often are scarce. Various uncertainty\nestimation methods and acquisition strategies (regions and full images) are\ninvestigated. We observe that selecting regions to annotate instead of full\nimages leads to more well-calibrated models. Additionally, we experimentally\nshow that annotating regions can cut 50% of pixels that need to be labeled by\nhumans compared to annotating full images.",
    "  This paper presents a new Bayesian collaborative sparse regression method for\nlinear unmixing of hyperspectral images. Our contribution is twofold; first, we\npropose a new Bayesian model for structured sparse regression in which the\nsupports of the sparse abundance vectors are a priori spatially correlated\nacross pixels (i.e., materials are spatially organised rather than randomly\ndistributed at a pixel level). This prior information is encoded in the model\nthrough a truncated multivariate Ising Markov random field, which also takes\ninto consideration the facts that pixels cannot be empty (i.e, there is at\nleast one material present in each pixel), and that different materials may\nexhibit different degrees of spatial regularity. Secondly, we propose an\nadvanced Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the posterior\nprobabilities that materials are present or absent in each pixel, and,\nconditionally to the maximum marginal a posteriori configuration of the\nsupport, compute the MMSE estimates of the abundance vectors. A remarkable\nproperty of this algorithm is that it self-adjusts the values of the parameters\nof the Markov random field, thus relieving practitioners from setting\nregularisation parameters by cross-validation. The performance of the proposed\nmethodology is finally demonstrated through a series of experiments with\nsynthetic and real data and comparisons with other algorithms from the\nliterature.\n",
    "Superpixel segmentation has become an important research problem in image\nprocessing. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Spanning Forest (ISF)\nframework, based on sequences of Image Foresting Transforms, where one can\nchoose i) a seed sampling strategy, ii) a connectivity function, iii) an\nadjacency relation, and iv) a seed pixel recomputation procedure to generate\nimproved sets of connected superpixels (supervoxels in 3D) per iteration. The\nsuperpixels in ISF structurally correspond to spanning trees rooted at those\nseeds. We present five ISF methods to illustrate different choices of its\ncomponents. These methods are compared with approaches from the\nstate-of-the-art in effectiveness and efficiency. The experiments involve 2D\nand 3D datasets with distinct characteristics, and a high level application,\nnamed sky image segmentation.

    "It is important to find the target as soon as possible for search and rescue\noperations. Surveillance camera systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are\nused to support search and rescue. Automatic object detection is important\nbecause a person cannot monitor multiple surveillance screens simultaneously\nfor 24 hours. Also, the object is often too small to be recognized by the human\neye on the surveillance screen. This study used UAVs around the Port of Houston\nand fixed surveillance cameras to build an automatic target detection system\nthat supports the US Coast Guard (USCG) to help find targets (e.g., person\noverboard). We combined image segmentation, enhancement, and convolution neural\nnetworks to reduce detection time to detect small targets.

The wind flow is modeled by a\nmulti-mesh (cut finite element) method. This allows each building to be\nembedded in a boundary-fitted mesh which can be moved freely on top of a fixed\nbackground mesh. This approach enables a multitude of settlement layouts to be\nevaluated without the need for costly mesh generation when changing the\nconfiguration of buildings.

    "In photography, low depth of field (DOF) is an important technique to\nemphasize the object of interest (OOI) within an image. Thus, low DOF images\nare widely used in the application area of macro, portrait or sports\nphotography. When viewing a low DOF image, the viewer implicitly concentrates\non the regions that are sharper regions of the image and thus segments the\nimage into regions of interest and non regions of interest which has a major\nimpact on the perception of the image. Thus, a robust algorithm for the fully\nautomatic detection of the OOI in low DOF images provides valuable information\nfor subsequent image processing and image retrieval.

    "  We consider the Longest Queue Drop memory management policy in shared-memory\nswitches consisting of $N$ output ports. The shared memory of size $M\\geq N$\nmay have an arbitrary number of input ports. Each packet may be admitted by any\nincoming port, but must be destined to a specific output port and each output\nport may be used by only one queue. The Longest Queue Drop policy is a natural\nonline strategy used in directing the packet flow in buffering problems.\nAccording to this policy and assuming unit packet values and cost of\ntransmission, every incoming packet is accepted, whereas if the shared memory\nbecomes full, one or more packets belonging to the longest queue are preempted,\nin order to make space for the newly arrived packets. It was proved in 2001\n[Hahne et al., SPAA '01] that the Longest Queue Drop policy is 2-competitive\nand at least $\\sqrt{2}$-competitive.

    "We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network\narchitecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core\ntrainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding\ndecoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture\nof the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional\nlayers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low\nresolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for\npixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which\nthe decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically,\nthe decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the\ncorresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the\nneed for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then\nconvolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our\nproposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN and also with the well known\nDeepLab-LargeFOV, DeconvNet architectures. This comparison reveals the memory\nversus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance.\n  SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it\nis designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time\nduring inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable\nparameters than other competing architectures.

    "Methods that move towards less supervised scenarios are key for image\nsegmentation, as dense labels demand significant human intervention.

Egg images are segmented\nusing the K-means algorithm based on Lab color images. The results of the\nimages acquisition are converted into Lab color space images. The results of\nLab color space images are processed using K-means for each color. The K-means\nprocess uses cluster k=3, where this cluster divided the image into three\nparts, namely background, eggs, and yolk eggs. Yolk eggs are part of eggs that\nhave embryonic characteristics. This study applies the concept of color in the\ninitial segmentation and grayscale in the final stages.

    "Image segmentation is a fundamental research topic in image processing and\ncomputer vision. In the last decades, researchers developed a large number of\nsegmentation algorithms for various applications. Amongst these algorithms, the\nNormalized cut (Ncut) segmentation method is widely applied due to its good\nperformance. The Ncut segmentation model is an optimization problem whose\nenergy is defined on a specifically designed graph. Thus, the segmentation\nresults of the existing Ncut method are largely dependent on a pre-constructed\nsimilarity measure on the graph since this measure is usually given empirically\nby users. This flaw will lead to some undesirable segmentation results. In this\npaper, we propose a Ncut-based segmentation algorithm by integrating an\nadaptive similarity measure and spatial regularization. The proposed model\ncombines the Parzen-Rosenblatt window method, non-local weights entropy, Ncut\nenergy, and regularizer of phase field in a variational framework. Our method\ncan adaptively update the similarity measure function by estimating some\nparameters. This adaptive procedure enables the proposed algorithm finding a\nbetter similarity measure for classification than the Ncut method. We provide\nsome mathematical interpretation of the proposed adaptive similarity from\nmulti-viewpoints such as statistics and convex optimization. In addition, the\nregularizer of phase field can guarantee that the proposed algorithm has a\nrobust performance in the presence of noise, and it can also rectify the\nsimilarity measure with a spatial priori. The well-posed theory such as the\nexistence of the minimizer for the proposed model is given in the paper.\nCompared with some existing segmentation methods such as the traditional\nNcut-based model and the classical Chan-Vese model, the numerical experiments\nshow that our method can provide promising segmentation results.",
    "  Text data is often seen as \"take-away\" materials with little noise and easy\nto process information. Main questions are how to get data and transform them\ninto a good document format. But data can be sensitive to noise oftenly called\nambiguities. Ambiguities are aware from a long time, mainly because polysemy is\nobvious in language and context is required to remove uncertainty. I claim in\nthis paper that syntactic context is not suffisant to improve interpretation.\nIn this paper I try to explain that firstly noise can come from natural data\nthemselves, even involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified\nbut meaningless, can spoil content of a corpus; it may lead to contradictions\nand background noise.\n",
    "The task of image segmentation is inherently noisy due to ambiguities\nregarding the exact location of boundaries between anatomical structures. We\nargue that this information can be extracted from the expert annotations at no\nextra cost, and when integrated into state-of-the-art neural networks, it can\nlead to improved calibration between soft probabilistic predictions and the\nunderlying uncertainty. We built upon label smoothing (LS) where a network is\ntrained on 'blurred' versions of the ground truth labels which has been shown\nto be effective for calibrating output predictions. However, LS is not taking\nthe local structure into account and results in overly smoothed predictions\nwith low confidence even for non-ambiguous regions. Here, we propose Spatially\nVarying Label Smoothing (SVLS), a soft labeling technique that captures the\nstructural uncertainty in semantic segmentation. SVLS also naturally lends\nitself to incorporate inter-rater uncertainty when multiple labelmaps are\navailable. The proposed approach is extensively validated on four clinical\nsegmentation tasks with different imaging modalities, number of classes and\nsingle and multi-rater expert annotations. The results demonstrate that SVLS,\ndespite its simplicity, obtains superior boundary prediction with improved\nuncertainty and model calibration.",
    "Medical image segmentation is inherently an ambiguous task due to factors\nsuch as partial volumes and variations in anatomical definitions. While in most\ncases the segmentation uncertainty is around the border of structures of\ninterest, there can also be considerable inter-rater differences. The class of\nconditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) offers a principled approach to\ninferring distributions over plausible segmentations that are conditioned on\ninput images. Segmentation uncertainty estimated from samples of such\ndistributions can be more informative than using pixel level probability\nscores. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model that is\nbased on conditional Normalizing Flow (cFlow). The basic idea is to increase\nthe expressivity of the cVAE by introducing a cFlow transformation step after\nthe encoder. This yields improved approximations of the latent posterior\ndistribution, allowing the model to capture richer segmentation variations.\nWith this we show that the quality and diversity of samples obtained from our\nconditional generative model is enhanced. Performance of our model, which we\ncall cFlow Net, is evaluated on two medical imaging datasets demonstrating\nsubstantial improvements in both qualitative and quantitative measures when\ncompared to a recent cVAE based model.",
    "Currently, developments of deep learning techniques are providing\ninstrumental to identify, classify, and quantify patterns in medical images.\nSegmentation is one of the important applications in medical image analysis. In\nthis regard, U-Net is the predominant approach to medical image segmentation\ntasks. However, we found that those U-Net based models have limitations in\nseveral aspects, for example, millions of parameters in the U-Net consuming\nconsiderable computation resource and memory, lack of global information, and\nmissing some tough objects. Therefore, we applied two modifications to improve\nthe U-Net model: 1) designed and added the dilated channel-wise CNN module, 2)\nsimplified the U shape network. Based on these two modifications, we proposed a\nnovel light-weight architecture -- Channel-wise Feature Pyramid Network for\nMedicine (CFPNet-M). To evaluate our method, we selected five datasets with\ndifferent modalities: thermography, electron microscopy, endoscopy, dermoscopy,\nand digital retinal images. And we compared its performance with several models\nhaving different parameter scales. This paper also involves our previous\nstudies of DC-UNet and some commonly used light-weight neural networks. We\napplied the Tanimoto similarity instead of the Jaccard index for gray-level\nimage measurements. By comparison, CFPNet-M achieves comparable segmentation\nresults on all five medical datasets with only 0.65 million parameters, which\nis about 2% of U-Net, and 8.8 MB memory.

    "  In the current hyper-connected era, modern Information and Communication\nTechnology systems form sophisticated networks where not only do people\ninteract with other people, but also machines take an increasingly visible and\nparticipatory role. Such human-machine networks (HMNs) are embedded in the\ndaily lives of people, both for personal and professional use. They can have a\nsignificant impact by producing synergy and innovations. The challenge in\ndesigning successful HMNs is that they cannot be developed and implemented in\nthe same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, nor following a wholly\nhuman-centric view of the network. The problem requires an interdisciplinary\napproach. Here, we review current research of relevance to HMNs across many\ndisciplines. Extending the previous theoretical concepts of socio-technical\nsystems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social\nmachines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans\nand machines. We identify eight types of HMNs: public-resource computing,\ncrowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media,\nmultiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. We\nsystematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a\nfocus on implications for designing HMNs.

    "  In a k-linear triangulated category (where k is a field) we show that the\nexistence of Auslander-Reiten triangles implies that objects are determined, up\nto shift, by knowing dimensions of homomorphisms between them. In most cases\nthe objects themselves are distinguished by this information, a conclusion\nwhich was also reached under slightly different hypotheses in a theorem of\nJensen, Su and Zimmermann. The approach is to consider bilinear forms on\nGrothendieck groups which are analogous to the Green ring of a finite group.\n  We specialize to the category of perfect complexes for a self-injective\nalgebra, for which the Auslander-Reiten quiver has a known shape. We\ncharacterize the position in the quiver of many kinds of perfect complexes,\nincluding those of lengths 1, 2 and 3, rigid complexes and truncated projective\nresolutions. We describe completely the quiver components which contain\nprojective modules. We obtain relationships between the homology of complexes\nat different places in the quiver, deducing that every self-injective algebra\nof radical length at least 3 has indecomposable perfect complexes with\narbitrarily large homology in any given degree. We find also that homology\nstabilizes away from the rim of the quiver. We show that when the algebra is\nsymmetric, one of the forms considered earlier is Hermitian, and this allows us\nto compute its values knowing them only on objects on the rim of the quiver.\n",

    "Recent advances in deep learning based image segmentation methods have\nenabled real-time performance with human-level accuracy. However, occasionally\neven the best method fails due to low image quality, artifacts or unexpected\nbehaviour of black box algorithms. Being able to predict segmentation quality\nin the absence of ground truth is of paramount importance in clinical practice,\nbut also in large-scale studies to avoid the inclusion of invalid data in\nsubsequent analysis.\n  In this work, we propose two approaches of real-time automated quality\ncontrol for cardiovascular MR segmentations using deep learning.

    "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have had unprecedented success in medical\nimaging and, in particular, in medical image segmentation. However, despite the\nfact that segmentation results are closer than ever to the inter-expert\nvariability, CNNs are not immune to producing anatomically inaccurate\nsegmentations, even when built upon a shape prior. In this paper, we present a\nframework for producing cardiac image segmentation maps that are guaranteed to\nrespect pre-defined anatomical criteria, while remaining within the\ninter-expert variability. The idea behind our method is to use a well-trained\nCNN, have it process cardiac images, identify the anatomically implausible\nresults and warp these results toward the closest anatomically valid cardiac\nshape. This warping procedure is carried out with a constrained variational\nautoencoder (cVAE) trained to learn a representation of valid cardiac shapes\nthrough a smooth, yet constrained, latent space. With this cVAE, we can project\nany implausible shape into the cardiac latent space and steer it toward the\nclosest correct shape. We tested our framework on short-axis MRI as well as\napical two and four-chamber view ultrasound images, two modalities for which\ncardiac shapes are drastically different.

    "Compared to the general semantic segmentation problem, portrait segmentation\nhas higher precision requirement on boundary area. However, this problem has\nnot been well studied in previous works. In this paper, we propose a\nboundary-sensitive deep neural network (BSN) for portrait segmentation. BSN\nintroduces three novel techniques. First, an individual boundary-sensitive\nkernel is proposed by dilating the contour line and assigning the boundary\npixels with multi-class labels. Second, a global boundary-sensitive kernel is\nemployed as a position sensitive prior to further constrain the overall shape\nof the segmentation map. Third, we train a boundary-sensitive attribute\nclassifier jointly with the segmentation network to reinforce the network with\nsemantic boundary shape information. We have evaluated BSN on the current\nlargest public portrait segmentation dataset, i.e, the PFCN dataset, as well as\nthe portrait images collected from other three popular image segmentation\ndatasets: COCO, COCO-Stuff, and PASCAL VOC. Our method achieves the superior\nquantitative and qualitative performance over state-of-the-arts on all the\ndatasets, especially on the boundary area.",
    "In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to discriminate between cultivated\nmaize plant and grass or grass-like weed image segments using the context\nsurrounding the image segments. While convolutional neural networks have\nbrought state of the art accuracies within object detection, errors arise when\nobjects in different classes share similar features. This scenario often occurs\nwhen objects in images are viewed at too small of a scale to discern distinct\ndifferences in features, causing images to be incorrectly classified or\nlocalized. To solve this problem, we will explore using context when\nclassifying image segments. This technique involves feeding a convolutional\nneural network a central square image along with a border of its direct\nsurroundings at train and test times. This means that although images are\nlabelled at a smaller scale to preserve accurate localization, the network\nclassifies the images and learns features that include the wider context. We\ndemonstrate the benefits of this context technique in the object detection task\nthrough a case study of grass (foxtail) and grass-like (yellow nutsedge) weed\ndetection in maize fields. In this standard situation, adding context alone\nnearly halved the error of the neural network from 7.1% to 4.3%. After only one\nepoch with context, the network also achieved a higher accuracy than the\nnetwork without context did after 50 epochs. The benefits of using the context\ntechnique are likely to particularly evident in agricultural contexts in which\nparts (such as leaves) of several plants may appear similar when not taking\ninto account the context in which those parts appear.",
    "  An information theoretic approach to bounds in superconformal field theories\nis proposed.

    "In the recent years, convolutional neural networks have transformed the field\nof medical image analysis due to their capacity to learn discriminative image\nfeatures for a variety of classification and regression tasks. However,\nsuccessfully learning these features requires a large amount of manually\nannotated data, which is expensive to acquire and limited by the available\nresources of expert image analysts. Therefore, unsupervised, weakly-supervised\nand self-supervised feature learning techniques receive a lot of attention,\nwhich aim to utilise the vast amount of available data, while at the same time\navoid or substantially reduce the effort of manual annotation. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel way for training a cardiac MR image segmentation network, in\nwhich features are learnt in a self-supervised manner by predicting anatomical\npositions.

We demonstrate that this seemingly simple task\nprovides a strong signal for feature learning and with self-supervised\nlearning, we achieve a high segmentation accuracy that is better than or\ncomparable to a U-net trained from scratch, especially at a small data setting.\nWhen only five annotated subjects are available, the proposed method improves\nthe mean Dice metric from 0.811 to 0.852 for short-axis image segmentation,\ncompared to the baseline U-net.",
    "Medical image segmentation plays an essential role in developing\ncomputer-assisted diagnosis and therapy systems, yet still faces many\nchallenges. In the past few years, the popular encoder-decoder architectures\nbased on CNNs (e.g., U-Net) have been successfully applied in the task of\nmedical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution\noperations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and\nlong-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce\ntransformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results,\nbut the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational\ncomplexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which\nintegrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and\naccurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder\nof the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the\nTransformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks\nand convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via\nskip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the\nfeature maps.

    "We propose adversarial constrained-CNN loss, a new paradigm of\nconstrained-CNN loss methods, for weakly supervised medical image segmentation.\nIn the new paradigm, prior knowledge is encoded and depicted by reference\nmasks, and is further employed to impose constraints on segmentation outputs\nthrough adversarial learning with reference masks. Unlike pseudo label methods\nfor weakly supervised segmentation, such reference masks are used to train a\ndiscriminator rather than a segmentation network, and thus are not required to\nbe paired with specific images. Our new paradigm not only greatly facilitates\nimposing prior knowledge on network's outputs, but also provides stronger and\nhigher-order constraints, i.e., distribution approximation, through adversarial\nlearning. Extensive experiments involving different medical modalities,\ndifferent anatomical structures, different topologies of the object of\ninterest, different levels of prior knowledge and weakly supervised annotations\nwith different annotation ratios is conducted to evaluate our ACCL method.\nConsistently superior segmentation results over the size constrained-CNN loss\nmethod have been achieved, some of which are close to the results of full\nsupervision, thus fully verifying the effectiveness and generalization of our\nmethod.

    "Automatic parsing of anatomical objects in X-ray images is critical to many\nclinical applications in particular towards image-guided invention and workflow\nautomation.

The\nTD-GAN framework is general and can be easily adapted to other learning tasks.\nIn the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and\n153 topograms.

We disprove this conjecture by showing that the\ncolors of singular points of the cycle may affect the dimensions. However, the\ncolors of smooth points are irrelevant. By using bistellar moves we show that\nthe number of different dimension vectors arising on a given 3-dimensional\npseudomanifold with isolated singularities is a topological invariant. This\ninvariant is trivial on manifolds, but nontrivial in general.\n",
    "In Computer Vision, edge detection is one of the favored approaches for\nfeature and object detection in images since it provides information about\ntheir objects boundaries. Other region-based approaches use probabilistic\nanalysis such as clustering and Markov random fields, but those methods cannot\nbe used to analyze edges and their interaction. In fact, only image\nsegmentation can produce regions based on edges, but it requires thresholding\nby simply separating the regions into binary in-out information. Hence, there\nis currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, since edges\ncannot be used to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The\nobjective of this paper is to present a novel spatial probability analysis that\nallows determining the probability of inclusion inside a set of partial\ncontours (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed a new approach that\nuses electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the\nrequired probabilities. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a continuous\nspace of probability based only on the edge information, thus bridging the gap\nbetween the edge-based methods and the region-based methods. The developed\nmethod is consistent with the fundamental properties of inclusion probabilities\nand its results are validated by comparing an image with the probability-based\nestimation given by our algorithm. The method can also be generalized to take\ninto consideration the intensity of the edges or to be used for 3D shapes. This\nis the first documented method that allows computing a space of probability\nbased on interacting edges, which opens the path to broader applications such\nas image segmentation and contour completion.",
    "America has a massive railway system. As of 2006, U.S. freight railroads have\n140,490 route- miles of standard gauge, but maintaining such a huge system and\neliminating any dangers, like reduced track stability and poor drainage, caused\nby railway ballast degradation require huge amount of labor. The traditional\nway to quantify the degradation of ballast is to use an index called Fouling\nIndex (FI) through ballast sampling and sieve analysis. However, determining\nthe FI values in lab is very time-consuming and laborious, but with the help of\nrecent development in the field of computer vision, a novel method for a\npotential machine-vison based ballast inspection system can be employed that\ncan hopefully replace the traditional mechanical method. The new machine-vision\napproach analyses the images of the in-service ballasts, and then utilizes\nimage segmentation algorithm to get ballast segments. By comparing the segment\nresults and their corresponding FI values, this novel method produces a\nmachine-vision-based index that has the best-fit relation with FI. The\nimplementation details of how this algorithm works are discussed in this\nreport.",
    "This paper aims at developing an integrated system of clothing co-parsing, in\norder to jointly parse a set of clothing images (unsegmented but annotated with\ntags) into semantic configurations. We propose a data-driven framework\nconsisting of two phases of inference. The first phase, referred as \"image\nco-segmentation\", iterates to extract consistent regions on images and jointly\nrefines the regions over all images by employing the exemplar-SVM (E-SVM)\ntechnique [23]. In the second phase (i.e. \"region co-labeling\"), we construct a\nmulti-image graphical model by taking the segmented regions as vertices, and\nincorporate several contexts of clothing configuration (e.g., item location and\nmutual interactions). The joint label assignment can be solved using the\nefficient Graph Cuts algorithm. In addition to evaluate our framework on the\nFashionista dataset [30], we construct a dataset called CCP consisting of 2098\nhigh-resolution street fashion photos to demonstrate the performance of our\nsystem. We achieve 90.29% / 88.23% segmentation accuracy and 65.52% / 63.89%\nrecognition rate on the Fashionista and the CCP datasets, respectively, which\nare superior compared with state-of-the-art methods.",
    "Color and intensity are two important components in an image. Usually, groups\nof image pixels, which are similar in color or intensity, are an informative\nrepresentation for an object. They are therefore particularly suitable for\ncomputer vision tasks, such as saliency detection and object proposal\ngeneration. However, image pixels, which share a similar real-world color, may\nbe quite different since colors are often distorted by intensity. In this\npaper, we reinvestigate the affinity matrices originally used in image\nsegmentation methods based on spectral clustering. A new affinity matrix, which\nis robust to color distortions, is formulated for object discovery. Moreover, a\nCohesion Measurement (CM) for object regions is also derived based on the\nformulated affinity matrix. Based on the new Cohesion Measurement, a novel\nobject discovery method is proposed to discover objects latent in an image by\nutilizing the eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. Then we apply the proposed\nmethod to both saliency detection and object proposal generation. Experimental\nresults on several evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CM based\nmethod has achieved promising performance for these two tasks.",
    "The automated segmentation of buildings in remote sensing imagery is a\nchallenging task that requires the accurate delineation of multiple building\ninstances over typically large image areas. Manual methods are often laborious\nand current deep-learning-based approaches fail to delineate all building\ninstances and do so with adequate accuracy. As a solution, we present Trainable\nDeep Active Contours (TDACs), an automatic image segmentation framework that\nintimately unites Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Active Contour\nModels (ACMs). The Eulerian energy functional of the ACM component includes\nper-pixel parameter maps that are predicted by the backbone CNN, which also\ninitializes the ACM. Importantly, both the ACM and CNN components are fully\nimplemented in TensorFlow and the entire TDAC architecture is end-to-end\nautomatically differentiable and backpropagation trainable without user\nintervention. TDAC yields fast, accurate, and fully automatic simultaneous\ndelineation of arbitrarily many buildings in the image. We validate the model\non two publicly available aerial image datasets for building segmentation, and\nour results demonstrate that TDAC establishes a new state-of-the-art\nperformance.",
    "We present a method combining affinity prediction with region agglomeration,\nwhich improves significantly upon the state of the art of neuron segmentation\nfrom electron microscopy (EM) in accuracy and scalability. Our method consists\nof a 3D U-NET, trained to predict affinities between voxels, followed by\niterative region agglomeration. We train using a structured loss based on\nMALIS, encouraging topologically correct segmentations obtained from affinity\nthresholding. Our extension consists of two parts: First, we present a\nquasi-linear method to compute the loss gradient, improving over the original\nquadratic algorithm. Second, we compute the gradient in two separate passes to\navoid spurious gradient contributions in early training stages. Our predictions\nare accurate enough that simple learning-free percentile-based agglomeration\noutperforms more involved methods used earlier on inferior predictions. We\npresent results on three diverse EM datasets, achieving relative improvements\nover previous results of 27%, 15%, and 250%. Our findings suggest that a single\nmethod can be applied to both nearly isotropic block-face EM data and\nanisotropic serial sectioned EM data. The runtime of our method scales linearly\nwith the size of the volume and achieves a throughput of about 2.6 seconds per\nmegavoxel, qualifying our method for the processing of very large datasets.",
    "  A single crystal of isovalently substituted Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ru$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$\n($x=0.24$) was sequentially irradiated with 2.5 MeV electrons up to a maximum\ndose of $2.1 \\times 10^{19}$ electrons/cm^2. The electrical resistivity was\nmeasured \\textit{in - situ} at $T=$22 K during the irradiation and \\textit{ex -\nsitu} as a function of temperature between subsequent irradiation runs. Upon\nirradiation, the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, decreases and\nthe residual resistivity, $\\rho_0$, increases. We find that electron\nirradiation leads to the fastest suppression of $T_c$ compared to other types\nof artificially introduced disorder, probably due to the strong short-range\npotential of the point-like irradiation defects. A more detailed analysis\nwithin a multiband scenario with variable scattering potential strength shows\nthat the observed $T_c$ vs. $\\rho_0$ is fully compatible with $s_\\pm$ pairing,\nin contrast to earlier claims that this model leads to a too rapid a\nsuppression of $T_c$ with scattering.\n",
    "  A Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) physics program of three LAr-TPC detectors\nlocated along the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab is presented. This\nnew SBN Program will deliver a rich and compelling physics opportunity,\nincluding the ability to resolve a class of experimental anomalies in neutrino\nphysics and to perform the most sensitive search to date for sterile neutrinos\nat the eV mass-scale through both appearance and disappearance oscillation\nchannels.

    "Image foreground extraction is a classical problem in image processing and\nvision, with a large range of applications. In this dissertation, we focus on\nthe extraction of text and graphics in mixed-content images, and design novel\napproaches for various aspects of this problem.\n  We first propose a sparse decomposition framework, which models the\nbackground by a subspace containing smooth basis vectors, and foreground as a\nsparse and connected component. We then formulate an optimization framework to\nsolve this problem, by adding suitable regularizations to the cost function to\npromote the desired characteristics of each component. We present two\ntechniques to solve the proposed optimization problem, one based on alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM), and the other one based on robust\nregression. Promising results are obtained for screen content image\nsegmentation using the proposed algorithm.\n  We then propose a robust subspace learning algorithm for the representation\nof the background component using training images that could contain both\nbackground and foreground components, as well as noise. With the learnt\nsubspace for the background, we can further improve the segmentation results,\ncompared to using a fixed subspace. Lastly, we investigate a different class of\nsignal/image decomposition problem, where only one signal component is active\nat each signal element. In this case, besides estimating each component, we\nneed to find their supports, which can be specified by a binary mask. We\npropose a mixed-integer programming problem, that jointly estimates the two\ncomponents and their supports through an alternating optimization scheme. We\nshow the application of this algorithm on various problems, including image\nsegmentation, video motion segmentation, and also separation of text from\ntextured images.",
    "  We develop a system for measurements of power spectra of transmitted light\nintensity fluctuations, in which the extraneous noise, including shot noise, is\nreduced. In essence, we just apply light, measure the power of the transmitted\nlight and derive its power spectrum. We use this to observe the spontaneous\nnoise spectra of photon atom interactions. Applying light with frequency\nmodulation, we can also observe the spontaneous noise reflecting the coherence\nbetween the hyperfine levels in the excited state. There are two in novel\ncomponents in the measurement system, the noise reduction scheme and the\nstabilization of the laser system. The noise reduction mechanism can be used to\nreduce the shot noise contribution to arbitrarily low levels through averaging,\nin principle. This is combined with differential detection to keep unwanted\nnoise at low levels. The laser system is stabilized to obtain spectral width\nbelow 1\\,kHz without high frequency ($\\gtrsim10\\,$MHz) noise. These methods are\ndescribed systematically and the performance of the asurement system is\nexamined through experimental results.\n",
    "  We propose a new class of models specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\ndata analysis. To this end, we generalize the spatial autoregressive model with\nautoregressive and heteroskedastic disturbances, i.e. SARAR(1,1), by exploiting\nthe recent advancements in Score Driven (SD) models typically used in time\nseries econometrics. In particular, we allow for time-varying spatial\nautoregressive coefficients as well as time-varying regressor coefficients and\ncross-sectional standard deviations. We report an extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulation study in order to investigate the finite sample properties of the\nMaximum Likelihood estimator for the new class of models as well as its\nflexibility in explaining several dynamic spatial dependence processes.

    "The performance of deep networks for semantic image segmentation largely\ndepends on the availability of large-scale training images which are labelled\nat the pixel level. Typically, such pixel-level image labellings are obtained\nmanually by a labour-intensive process. To alleviate the burden of manual image\nlabelling, we propose an interesting learning approach to generate pixel-level\nimage labellings automatically. A Guided Filter Network (GFN) is first\ndeveloped to learn the segmentation knowledge from a source domain, and such\nGFN then transfers such segmentation knowledge to generate coarse object masks\nin the target domain. Such coarse object masks are treated as pseudo labels and\nthey are further integrated to optimize/refine the GFN iteratively in the\ntarget domain. Our experiments on six image sets have demonstrated that our\nproposed approach can generate fine-grained object masks (i.e., pixel-level\nobject labellings), whose quality is very comparable to the manually-labelled\nones. Our proposed approach can also achieve better performance on semantic\nimage segmentation than most existing weakly-supervised approaches.",
    "Tensor networks provide an efficient approximation of operations involving\nhigh dimensional tensors and have been extensively used in modelling quantum\nmany-body systems. More recently, supervised learning has been attempted with\ntensor networks, primarily focused on tasks such as image classification.

We use the matrix product state (MPS) tensor network on non-overlapping\npatches of a given input image to predict the segmentation mask by learning a\npixel-wise linear classification rule in a high dimensional space. The proposed\nmodel is end-to-end trainable using backpropagation. It is implemented as a\nStrided Tensor Network to reduce the parameter complexity. The performance of\nthe proposed method is evaluated on two public medical imaging datasets and\ncompared to relevant baselines.

    "  A path in an edge-colored graph $G$ is rainbow if no two edges of it are\ncolored the same. The graph $G$ is rainbow-connected if there is a rainbow path\nbetween every pair of vertices.

    "All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.\nMoazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn't do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don't see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.",
    "Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"",

They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos.

The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.

Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.\n\"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over. What can you do but laugh about it? It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.\n\"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\"",

    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it.

    "AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United \"know they made a mistake\" by selling him in 2001.\nThe sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. \"United made a mistake in selling me,\" Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. \"I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. \"There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?\"\nWednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. \"We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone,\" he said. \"Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. \"I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do.\"",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",

    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.\nVedomosti newspaper reported that Russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\nGazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.",
    "Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.\nAlan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.

    "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.\nInbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",

    "You can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.",
    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.",
    "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\nMr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

    "Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has played down reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona.\n\"He's been responding well to treatment and started running on Friday, but we'll have to wait and see,\" he told BBC Five Live's Sportsweek. \"We're looking to getting him back as soon as possible, but he'll be back when it's right for him and for us. \"There's no plans at the moment around the Barcelona game.\" His comments contradict those of chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman who treated the Dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of February. Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.

    "Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 \n - A freeze on petrol duty \n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.\"\nBut Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.",
    "Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"\nThe Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n\"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages.

    "Jesper Gronkjaer has agreed a move to Atletico Madrid from Birmingham City.\nThe 27-year-old winger spent just five months at St Andrews following a £2.2m move from Chelsea in July after playing for Denmark at Euro 2004. He is set to move during the January transfer window in a deal rumoured to be about £1.4m, subject to a medical. \"We will meet with the player's representative to finalise the contract and decide when he will sign,\" said Atletico sporting director Toni Munoz. Gronkjaer has been targeted by Blues fans and was sarcastically applauded when taken off against Everton last month. Boss Steve Bruce had said that he would be happy to let the Danish international go if the price was right. He added: \"I'm not going to say the decision to let him go is down to the fans' reaction towards him.\n\"He has had a tough time since the summer with the loss of his mother and finding it difficult to adjust to a new club and a different area. \"He has been terrific and not missed a day's training and is someone if your daughter brought them home you would be delighted. \"It just hasn't quite worked out here for him.

    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W.

There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",
    "World 5000m champion Eliud Kipchoge won the 9.2km race at the View From Great Edinburgh Cross Country.\nThe Kenyan, who was second when Newcastle hosted the race last year, was in front from the outset. Ethiopian duo Gebre Gebremariam and Dejene Berhanu made last-gasp efforts to overtake him, but Kipchoge responded and a burst of speed clinched victory. Gavin Thompson was the first Briton in 12th place while Nick McCormick held of his British rivals to win the 4km race. The Morpeth Harrier led from the end of the first lap and ended Mike Skinner and Andrew Baddeley's hopes with a surge in the lasp lap. \"My training has gone so well I wasn't really worried about the opposition asI knew I was in great shape,\" said McCormick, who now hopes to earn a 1,500m place in the British team for the World Championships in Helsinki. In the women's race, Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba won a battle with world cross country champion Benita Johnson to retain her title. Australian Johnson, who shocked her African rivals in Brussels last March, looked to be on course for another win in the 6.2km race. But world 5000m champion Dibaba make a telling strike for the finishing line in the final 20 metres. Britons Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling were out of contention early on.",
    "Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. But what you will not find is much Spanish-language hip-hop.\nHip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now, a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. They have a devoted fan base in their native Monterrey. But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\nTheir biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O'Leary. \"I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.",
    "The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.\nIt is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.\nOnce completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. \"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,\" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.\nIn second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.\nSince the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",

    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. \"He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did,\" Keegan said. \"He has worked hard to get back to where he is now.\" The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"",
    "Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner.

    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.\nAfter Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: \"It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. \"We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.\" Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. \"It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams.\"",
    "Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"",
    "Pop singer Delta Goodrem has scooped one of the top individual prizes at the first Australian MTV Music Awards.\nThe 21-year-old singer won the award for best female artist, with Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll taking the title of best male at the ceremony. Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won awards for best R 'n' B video and sexiest video, both for Hey Mama. Local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins took the title of breakthrough artist of the year, with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian taking the honours for best pop video. The VH1 First Music Award went to Cher honouring her achievements within the music industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbour and was hosted by the Osbourne family. Artists including Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osbourne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia gave live performances at the event.",
    "Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.\nMoya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\"",
    "A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's \"lackadaisical\" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.\nPublic accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was \"dragging its heels\".\nThat comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been \"dreadfully slow\" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.\nThe outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. \"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,\" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.\nMinisters had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between \"two and three times\" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, \"but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations\".\nMr Leigh said being \"better prepared\" would also help avoid the need for \"mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak\". A Defra spokesman said: \"We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. \"However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.\"",
    "Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.\nThe beta program only works on PCs running Windows XP or Windows 2000. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files. Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.\n\"Our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft's MSN internet division. Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program. The software giant is coming late to the desktop search arena, competing with a large number of rivals. Google has already released a desktop tool. Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year. Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",

But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn't let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life.

    "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\nAgriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.",
    "Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's \"bullying\" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.\nShe said \"superior\" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen's former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said. She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking \"agendas\".\n\"I had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are.\" Media observers had been surprised by Greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: \"I'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I don't discuss them. \"I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them.\" Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.\nOther celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.\nVOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?   Yes  No   Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion\nHappy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still \"wide open\", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1. DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes.

    "Tony Blair has pledged to \"never, ever, ever\" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.\nThe prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: \"If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically.\" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were \"anti-Semitic\". These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\nMr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\nRates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
    "Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.",
    "Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?\"",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"",

Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.

    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.\nNew owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.",
    "The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \n \nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \n \nUniversal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425). \n \nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). \n \nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n \nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n \nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",
    "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",
    "Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\nThe thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.\nThese online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn't lead it.\"\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,\" said Mr Nachison. \"And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.\"",
    "China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week. Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT.",
    "Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.",
    "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
    "Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.\nMore than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club.\nAnelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: \"I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. \"We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club.\" Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: \"There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka.\n\"If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. \"If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. \"We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that.\" Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: \"I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. \"If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. \"But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. \"He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club.\" City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: \"Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. \"We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing.\"",
    "The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\nThe Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\nCampaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\nIn a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\nSaying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\nMr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\nLabour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.",

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"",

Lee told them to \"work up the corporate ladder because everybody can't be an actor, everybody can't make a record\". He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films.\nReturning to his old university, which educates only African American students, Lee discussed the challenges facing black people in the entertainment industry. \"Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,\" Lee said. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. \"It's a huge market,\" the 47-year-old director said. \"It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild.\" Lee has made more than 25 films, including Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, Summer of Sam and 1986 hit She's Gotta Have It.",
    "Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.\nLaunched this week, the World Community Grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.\nAnyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the WGC website. Once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.\nThe subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.\n\"The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,\" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. \"[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems\", she added. IBM has donated the hardware, software, technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid.

News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",
    "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "Campaigners against the expansion of Britain's airports have begun challenging the government's plans in the High Court.\nBAA's expansion of Stansted Airport in Essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. Opponents say the £2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used. They said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick. They have said they cannot raise the money needed for the Stansted upgrades from current landing charges. BAA also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. Their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at Luton Airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at Heathrow. If the group wins, the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport White Paper could be left in ruins.\nThe campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the Isle of Sheppey east of London. Lord Hanningfield, leader of Essex County Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are going to the High Court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. \"We want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation, consultation and thought before the government came out with its Green Paper. \"Then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.\" He added: \"Politicians should not decide where runways should be.\" The Stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.\nThe airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the UK. But BAA has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. BAA is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.",
    "Olympic champion Justine Henin-Hardenne will return to action in January's Sydney International tournament.\nThe Belgian has not competed since losing her top world ranking at the US Open in September, where she was beaten in the fourth round by Nadia Petrova. She took time out to shake off a virus but will defend her titles in Sydney and at the Australian Open. Women's world number one Lindsay Davenport and French Open champion Anastasia Myskina will also compete.\nIn the men's event, world number three Lleyton Hewitt returns to defend his title, along with runner-up Carlos Moya. Moya, Spain's Davis Cup final hero in their recent win over the US, had to retire with an ankle injury in the first set of the final.\nTournament director Craig Watson said: \"I had a message relayed to me from him after Spain's Davis Cup victory, saying he was looking forward to trying to make up for his disappointment in the (2004) final. The tournament will take place from 9-15 January.",
    "What have the European Indoor trials told us? Well, I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects.\nIt was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.\nThe best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton's win in the 60m hurdles. Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. But what was great about Sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. Diane Allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah. And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head-to-head race will give Sarah confidence. In the men's race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. In fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid.\nPhillips Idowu lit up the field events, not only with his hair, but also with his leap of 17.30m, which puts him at the top of the world rankings. I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. He feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then Phillips always has. A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance. He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. Across the board I thought Kelly Sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. She picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than that. Kelly will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far.\nShe has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. It wasn't all good news in Sheffield. I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. Jason Gardener may have won but he wasn't at his best. I chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. He's there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. In the women's race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka. The pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but Joice had to pull out with a chest infection. If she had made the final I think Jeanette would have gone a bit quicker.\nJanine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case. The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her. A couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding Mark Findlay and Rabah Yusuf. Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for Great Britain. Yusuf, who came third in the 400m, is from the Sudan but is trying to gain British citizenship. He came to Britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe, started doing more running and found his talent. So we shall have to see what happens to both of them.",
    "Oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.\nLondon Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. \"It's amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.\nThe stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month highs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of Thursday.\nIn London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.\nThe price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.\nFears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in north America would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise. \"Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,\" said Kyle Cooper, at Citigroup Global Markets. \"Long term I think we're headed to $30-35 but I don't think we're doing that yet. We have a lot of winter left.\" John Person, president of National Futures Advisory Services, said the EIA data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the US. .",
    "The blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog Ofcom has said.\nContent on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV-quality video online becomes a norm. At a debate in Westminster, the net industry considered the options. Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. At the debate, organised by the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA), Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.\n\"The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves,\" he said. Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion.\nSome studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net. More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB, ITV and the BBC. Head of the division, Andrew Burke, spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. \"How risque can I be in this new age? With celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners, surely I can push it to the limit,\" he said.\nIn fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. Internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the Law Commission dubbed them \"mere conduits\" back in 2002. This defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. The level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali, said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. Huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the BBC offer TV content over the net. The BBC's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as EastEnders and Top Gear will make net TV mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions, he said.\nOne of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee, said Mr Ayers. As inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT. Mr Allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of \"impossible to regulate\" and \"just apply offline laws online\". In fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content. After Lord Currie departed, the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. \"If content is on-demand, consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them, then it is the consumers' choice to watch it. There is no watershed on the net,\" said Mr Burke.",
    "Hearts manager John Robertson hopes a place in the knock-out stages of the Uefa Cup could help keep some of his out-of-contract players at the club.\n\"It could help. If we get through and have another European tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season,\" he said. \"If we manage to get through it shows how well the club's progressing. \"They have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on.\" A win for Robertson's side against Ferencvaros would put them through to the last 32 if Basle fail to beat Feyenoord. \"It's very much the player's prerogative but the fact that we've been playing European football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive,\" added Robertson. \"But we want players who want to play for the football club, who are committed and a run in Europe always helps a little bit.\" With the game being played at Murrayfield instead of Tynecastle because of Uefa regulations, Robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue.\n\"The pitch is not in the greatest condition. The Heineken Cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is a bit threadbare,\" he said. \"It's not ideal but it's the same for both teams so we just have to go out and there and perform. That's the most important thing.\" But he added: \"If Tynecastle could have hosted 30,000 it would have been fantastic but that's one of the benefits of Murrayfield - it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it. \"There will be a good atmosphere and the Hearts fans have an important role to play. \"We need their encouragement, we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible. \"Hopefully the players will respond to that and I know they will because it's a fantastic European night for the club.\"",
    "A film based on the internet musings of the \"Baghdad Blogger\" has been shown at the Rotterdam Film Festival.\nThe film has been directed by the man who calls himself Salam Pax, the author of the weblog about Iraqi life during and after the war. The movie version comes in the form of a series of shorts made by Pax on a hand-held camera. Baghdad Blogger is among a number of films about Iraq showcased at the Dutch festival, which runs until Sunday. Following the fascination with the writing of Salam Pax - not his real name - he began a regular column in The Guardian newspaper and was given a crash course in documentary film-making. For the film he travelled Iraq to document the changing landscape of the country and the problems it has faced since the invasion, speaking to ordinary Iraqis about their experiences. The festival will also see the screening of Underexposure, one of Iraq's first features to emerge since the toppling of Saddam Hussein.\nDirector Oday Rasheed made the film on discarded 1980s Kodak film taken from the remains for the former Ministry of Culture building. It centres on the lives of families and strangers going about their everyday business as Baghdad is under siege. Rasheed said the title was refers to the isolation felt by Iraqis under Saddam's regime and the difficult time the country is now experiencing. \"Saddam's regime was hell, but now I think the hell has doubled,\" Rasheed said. The festival was also due to screen murdered Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh's film about the treatment of woman under Islam, but it was withdrawn due to safety fears. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed in November 2004, following death threats he received about his film Submission.",
    "The Conservative Party would deal \"sympathetically\" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.\nDr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for \"vindictiveness\" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.\nA jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.\nHe won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. Dr Fox was asked if he would say yes or no if Lord Archer applied to rejoin. \"I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. \"I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell.\"\nTory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. \"After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,\" he added. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. He said: \"I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. But there is no doubt it would be controversial.\" Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.",
    "The creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is to take on a new female superhero after signing up to write and direct the Wonder Woman movie.\nJoss Whedon described the DC Comics character as \"the most iconic female heroine of our time\". \"In a way, no one has met her yet,\" he said. \"What I love most about icons is finding out what's behind them, exploring the price of their power.\" Linda Carter played the character in the 1970s TV series. The character of Wonder Woman, famed for her red and gold costume, was born on Paradise Island, and was blessed with the powers of strength and flight. The film is being produced by Joel Silver, producer of the Matrix trilogy.\n\"There's no one better than Joss to adapt the legendary Wonder Woman comic book character created in the 1940s into a dynamic feature film for 21st Century audiences,\" said Silver. \"Wonder Woman was the first great female superhero to emerge from comic books and later inspire millions of fans in her television incarnation... but this groundbreaking heroine has yet to be reinvented for the feature film arena.\" Whedon created the character of Buffy in the screenplay for the 1992 film. He distanced himself from the movie because of the direction it eventually took, and the film bombed. But he did not give up on the Slayer and went on to write and executive produce seven seasons of the cult TV series. He also produced the spin-off Angel series. He is currently directing the film Serenity, based on his short-lived sci-fi series Firefly.",
    "The prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial, saying \"several hundred\" people in the UK are plotting terror attacks.\nThe government is facing opposition from Tory and Lib Dem MPs and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final Commons debate on the changes. But Tony Blair said there could be no concession on the \"basic principle\". Mr Blair told the BBC the \"control orders\" would only be used in the most limited circumstances. Critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. But the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders, instead saying judges will be able to quash them.\nAn explanation is being sent by Home Secretary Charles Clarke to all MPs and peers ahead of the final debate in the House of Commons. On Sunday, Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders. And Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. Some 32 Labour MPs voted against the legislation last week. Barbara Follett, whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in South Africa during the apartheid era, confirmed she would vote against the government.\nBut the government is continuing to insist that \"control orders\" must be issued by the home secretary. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: \"We are being advised by the police and the security services... \"What they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt. \"And these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances.\"\nA YouGov poll in the Daily Telegraph suggested 75% of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. But Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC News that the government was again making a mistake in \"rushing\" anti-terrorism legislation. \"I very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this.\" He said after meeting Tony Blair he had been left with the impression that \"he really wasn't interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward\". Mr Clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects - something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights. BBC political correspondent Vicky Young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the House of Lords, where Labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties. Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group Liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue. She said the legislation was \"a travesty and a perversion of justice\" and would remain \"unpalatable\" even if a judge was involved early in the process.",
    "Manchester United's Alex Ferguson has praised his players' gutsy performance in the 1-0 win at Aston Villa.\n\"That was our hardest away game of the season and it was a fantastic game of football, end-to-end with lots of good passing,\" said the Old Trafford boss. \"We showed lots of character and guts and we weren't going to lose. \"I look at that fixture and think we've been there and won, while Arsenal and Chelsea have yet to come and Villa may have some players back when they do.\" Ferguson also hailed senior stars Ryan Giggs and Roy Keane, who came off the bench for the injured John O'Shea. \"Roy came on and brought a bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got. \"Giggs was a tremendous threat and he brings tremendous penetration. \"All we can do is maintain our form, play as we are and we'll get our rewards.\"",
    "Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand, who shot to prominence in 2004, have won two Brit Awards.\nWith their self-titled debut, Franz Ferdinand have achieved what most rock bands crave - high credibility and critical acclaim while also selling stacks of CDs. They have risen to the head of the UK's art rock ranks with an album of songs that are catchy, creative and original enough to sound fresh. With a cool, spiky, fun sound previously associated with bands like Talking Heads, they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. Their first UK single hit number three last January, followed by two more top 20 hits, while the album has sold more than 600,000 copies in 11 months on release. In September it was named album of the year winning the prestigious Mercury Music Prize.\nOn the festivals circuit, they have been one of the main attractions for huge crowds at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Reading/Leeds. They have also found success in Japan, Europe and the US. By September the album had sold 500,000 in the States and total sales were pushing two million worldwide. They have been nominated for three Grammy awards in the US as well as the US music industry's Shortlist award, but lost the Shortlist prize to US band TV on the Radio. Nevertheless Franz Ferdinand were the only UK band to win an MTV Video Music Award this year, taking the breakthrough video crown for Take Me Out.\nThe four-piece met two years ago when drummer Paul Thomson was working at the Glasgow art school where bassist Bob Hardy was studying. Singer Alex Kapranos was studying English at university but had friends at art school, and the line-up was completed when guitarist Nick McCarthy moved from Munich, Germany, to the city. At the turn of the year, Kapranos told BBC News Online the band were fed up with serious bands in \"that post-rock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune\".\n\"We want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. But at the same time bringing an edge to it.\" Franz Ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song, Kapranos said. \"Where's the fun in that?\" they pondered at every stage, making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors. The band started out with a DIY ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in Glasgow and rename it The Chateau. The venue soon became legendary - so well-known that the police spent a month trying to find it, eventually raiding it and arresting Kapranos. But the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety, fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped.\nThe band took over an abandoned Victorian courtroom and jail instead, and named that The Chateau. The buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and 40 record labels turned up to one gig in Glasgow - which the band thought was \"totally ridiculous\". \"I'm really glad it was almost comical because we weren't overwhelmed by the seriousness of it,\" Kapranos said. They signed with independent label Domino, home of Smog, Sebadoh and Four Tet, in June 2003.",

    "German business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy.\nMunich-based research institute Ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in February from 97.5 in January, its first decline in three months. The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\n\"We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\nGermany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.",
    "The top civil servant at the centre of the David Blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the New Year Honours.\nSir John Gieve was Home Office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with Mr Blunkett quitting. He and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny came to be fast-tracked. The outgoing head of the troubled Child Support Agency Doug Smith also earns an honour in the New Year's list. Mr Smith, 57, whose retirement was announced by Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Smith in November, is made a Commander of the Order of Bath.\nBoth men were giving evidence to a Commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. The knighting of Sir John, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians.\nThe Liberal Democrats said it \"beggared belief\" he and fellow officials could not remember how Leoncia Casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain went from Mr Blunkett's office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department. Meanwhile, the Conservatives accused officials of a \"collective failure\" of memory. But Sir Alan Budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.\nDowning Street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: \"You have to look at their whole career.\" Sir John was made permanent secretary in April 2001 following a Civil Service career which dates back to 1974. He has also worked in the Treasury and the Department of Employment. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said of Mr Smith's honour: \"The award reflects all that he has achieved in a Civil Service career, principally in the Inland Revenue, spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the Child Support Agency.\n\"In his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes.\" Mr Smith is set to stay on at the CSA until March. Less controversial will be the knighthoods for Derek Wanless and Mike Tomlinson, who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively. Former NatWest chief executive Mr Wanless, 57, has delivered not one but two major reports on the NHS. Ex-chief inspector of schools Mr Tomlinson, 62, has recommended replacing A-Levels and GCSEs with a new diploma system in a shake-up of the exams system.",
    "Scarlets and USA Eagles forward Dave Hodges has ended his playing career to pursue a coaching role in the States.\nThe 36-year-old, who has 54 caps, was Llanelli's player of the season in 2001/2, but has battled injury for the last two of his seven years at Stradey. He tore a pectoral muscle against the Ospreys on Boxing Day, an injury that would have kept him out for the season. \"Realising I would be unable to play this season, the club and I agreed to end my contract early,\" said Hodges.\n\"It allows me to move back to the US and pursue opportunities there and allows the Scarlets to look to the next generation.\" The Scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing Heineken Cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks.\nScarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher confirmed that 17 of the current squad would be out of contract in the summer. \"We have a deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they won't all be re-signed, it's a chance to invigorate the squad,\" he said. \"I'm positive about the future of the Scarlets both on and off the field.\" Gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back-five forward Hodges has played at Stradey Park, though. \"David has been a highly influential member of our squad for seven years,\" said Gallacher. \"He is a real professional and we thank him for the part he has played in our success. \"I am sure he has an enormous contribution to make to the development of rugby in the US and we wish him and his family well.\" Hodges described his years at Stradey as \"the best time of my life.\"",
    "Rap mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight has been arrested for violating his parole after he was allegedly found with marijuana.\nHe was arrested in Barstow, California, on Saturday following an alleged traffic offence. He is expected to be transferred to a state prison while a decision is made on whether he should be released. Mr Knight, founder of Death Row Records, served a 10-month jail term in 2004 for punching a man while on parole for an assault conviction. Police said Mr Knight was stopped on Saturday after performing an illegal U-turn and a search of his car allegedly found marijuana.\nHe is also accused of not having insurance. A 18-year-old woman in the car was arrested for providing false information and having a fake ID card. She was later released. It was his second alleged violation, having previously served half of a nine-year sentence for breaking the terms of his parole. Mr Knight, 39, was jailed in October 1996 following his involvement in a fight with a rival gang just hours before rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in a Las Vegas drive-by shooting. He was driving Shakur's car at the time and was shot in the head. At the time he was on probation for assaulting two musicians. Mr Knight, a former bodyguard, set up Death Row records in the early 1990s with Shakur and Dr Dre among his protegees. But the label has always been dogged by allegations it supports gang culture and fuels the east and west coast rap rivalry.",
    "South Korea's Hyundai Motor has announced that it plans to build a second plant in India to meet the country's growing demand for cars.\nThe company didn't give details of its investment but it said the new plant would produce 150,000 cars a year. This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. Hyundai expects its sales in India to grow 16% to 250,000 in 2005. By 2010, it expects to nearly double sales to 400,000 cars. The new plant will be built close to the existing one in Chennai, in the southern province of Tamil Nadu.\nSouth Korea's top car maker estimates that the Indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1.6 million vehicles by 2010. Demand in India has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. Figures show that currently only eight people per thousand are car owners. \"We desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the Indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors,\" chairman Chung Mong-koo said in the statement. He said the company plans to use India as a base for exports to Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The company - which controls half of the South Korean's market - aims to become a global top five auto maker by 2010.",
    "The remaining members of rock band Queen are to go on tour next year with former Free and Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers taking Freddie Mercury's place.\nGuitarist Brian May has said he expects to be on the road with Rodgers and drummer Roger Taylor from April. May said: \"Suddenly the Queen Phoenix is rising again from the ashes and will take precedence over... our lives.\" Queen have played with many different singers since Mercury's death in 1991 but have reportedly not toured. May performed with Rodgers at a concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar in London in September.\n\"We were both so amazed at the chemistry that was going on in [Free hit] All Right Now, that suddenly it seems blindingly obvious that there was 'something happening here,'\" May wrote on his website. They teamed up again for a concert to mark their induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and were joined by Taylor. \"The show went so incredibly well from our point of view, and we got so many rave reactions from out there, we decided almost then and there that we would look at a tour together,\" May wrote.\nQueen went to number one in 2000 with a version of We Will Rock You sung by boy band 5ive and they have also played with Robbie Williams, Will Young and Bob Geldof. Queen bassist John Deacon has currently retired from the stage. Rodgers was singer with early 1970s rockers Free, who had a global hit with All Right Now, before forming Bad Company, a successful \"supergroup\" with members of King Crimson and Mott the Hoople. He has also been in The Firm with Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and The Law with The Small Faces and The Who drummer Kenny Jones.",
    "Jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant Yukos to a business partner.\nMr Khodorkovsky handed over his entire 59.5% stake in holding company Group Menatep - which controls Yukos - to Leonid Nevzlin. A close ally of the ex-Yukos boss, Mr Nevzlin is currently based in Israel. Mr Khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of Yukos' core oil production unit, Yuganskneftegaz to pay a giant tax bill.\nYuganskneftegaz was sold off at auction in December last year, eventually falling into the hands of state oil firm Rosneft in a deal worth $9.4bn (£5bn). \"Since the sale of Yuganskneftegaz, I have been delivered of (all) responsibility for the business that remains and the group's money as a whole,\" Mr Khodorkovsky said. \"It is all over. As before, I see my future in public activity to build a civil society in Russia.\" Mr Nevzlin is Yukos' largest shareholder but is living in self-imposed exile in Israel. Yuganskneftegaz pumps around 1 million barrels of oil a day. It was sold by the Russian authorities to recover government tax claims against Yukos totalling over $27bn. Previously considered to be Russia's richest man, with an estimated fortune of $15bn, Mr Khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in October 2003. However, the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs. It is also believed that Mr Khodorkovsky was particularly targeted because he had started to bankroll political opponents of Mr Putin.",
    "India's biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos.\n\"We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia,\" said ONGC chairman Subir Raha. Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos' former key oil production unit for $2bn (£1bn). Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.\nIt was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.\nState-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGC's plans during a trip to Moscow last year, and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putin's recent visit to New Delhi. \"It would make great sense for us to build on that,\" said Mr Aiyar. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. At the same time, India's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.\nIndia produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\n\"For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,\" said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India is a \"dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil\". By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. \"We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline,\" Mr Westwood said. \"By 2020, production may only be at half of today's levels.\" ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russia's Siberian coast.\nONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk.\nChinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on Thursday, Italy refused to rule out an interest. ONGC's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.",
    "Online role playing games are time-consuming, but enthralling flights from reality. But are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously?\nWhen video game World of Warcraft hit the shops in Europe last week fans wrote in to the BBC website to express their delight - and to offer a warning. \"An addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time,\" wrote Travis Anderson, in Texas. Some of the comments were humorous: \"This game is so good I'm not going to get it, there's no way I could limit the hours I'd spend playing it,\" wrote Charles MacIntyre, from England.\nBut some struck a more worrying tone about the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG): \"'You need to get out more' could be the motto of any MMORPG. Shame they are getting more popular, as you know this problem is just going to mushroom,\" wrote Stuart Stanton-Davies, in Huddersfield. Scare-mongering articles about \"addictive video games\" have existed since the days the first game of Pong stopped everyone from working at the Atari offices.\nGaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym, in front of the television, or reading poetry.\nUnfortunately, gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make. However, stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent. And the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some.\nMassively multiplayer online role playing games - MMORPGs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds. The scope of these games - like Warcraft, EverQuest, Ultima among others - is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite. Part of the \"problem\" is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded, mindless tasks, to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure. Such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing; not for no reason is EverQuest (EQ) nicknamed EverCrack. E Hayot, writing in the culture blogzine Print Culture, said recently: \"I used to play the online role-playing game EverQuest a lot. \"By 'a lot', I mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average, and on weeks where I didn't have to work, as many as 30 or 40 hours.\"\nHe says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour \"wasn't that unusual; lots of people I knew in the game played EQ that much\". \"You lie; you don't go into work because you \"had stuff to do at home\"; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner, you spend much less time watching TV (a good thing, presumably),\" he wrote, explaining how EverQuest took over his time. He quit the game, he says, because he realised life was more fun than EverQuest.\nLet us be clear - such obsession is rare. But the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far. Almost 400,000 people bought a copy of World of Warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month. Only a fraction will descend into obsessives. The thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by EverQuest can be found on one blog EverQuest Daily Grind. Jane, who runs the website, compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories. \"I am actually convinced at this point that there are more than 'some' people who spend more times in MMOPRGs than in reality,\" she said. One unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote: \"On the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as I do, I find that I am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me.\n\"I can't talk to him while he is playing. There is absolutely no point as he doesn't hear me or is so distracted that I get a 'ummm... ya' a few minutes after I ask him a question.\"\n\"Gaming widows\" has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers. But for some it is not in the least funny. Another correspondent wrote: \"I believe that he is addicted to the online gaming, and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness.\" And some of them are even sadder: \"Today our son was five days old. \"The sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his Warcraft game. He did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online.\" Video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised. But as gaming becomes ever more mainstream, and games ever more immersive, there will be no hiding place for social problems.\nI wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but I think it probably isn't. An 11 hour stretch isn't that surprising - I've known people to play 15+ hours at a stretch. I know of people who are spending their week's holiday from work playing Warcraft. I know of people who would play Ever[Crack] in shifts...waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they 'needed' to appear. I understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life. By all standards many of us are addicts. So is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing..or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting?\nSadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming, I find myself longing to have the time to join them. I have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began, games have become more and more complex. And more and more so I find I have less and less time to play them, with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time.\nI think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct. I play games a lot, definately over 20 hours a week, but I don't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.\nI have, about a year ago, deleted every game on my computer. RPGs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword. Unlike books, or perhaps even TV, you gain absolutely nothing. When you stop playing you're at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and, since you've gained nothing in the real world, you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.\nDespite having little monetary value, the \"rewards\" and encouragement offered by these MMORPGs is enough to hook games for hours daily. If only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition. Perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality?\nMy advice to gaming widows is \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\". That is, try playing it yourself. If he wants to play as well, well at least you'll be together somewhere...\nI was an addict and it cost me my relationship. I still play now, but without the guilt , hehe, How long have i played in one sitting? From morning till the early hours of the next day, the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain, i would hardly eat, perhaps some toast, smoke endlessly and drink. Now, thankfully the fascination has worn off and I have a girlfriend but still no job. For the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement, and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate.\nObsessive behaviour is, of course, always cause for concern, but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of \"reality\". Obviously, somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing EverQuest has a problem. This problem, however, has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality. An obsessive EQ player does not consider the game to be \"real\" any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human. If MMORPGs have a unique danger, in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour, it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world, but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7. The problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming, but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture.\nThe problem with these so called MMORPGS is that you can never really complete them, there's always another quest to do. A few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday...\nChampionship Manager consumed my life for years. One particular session started at about 2pm on a Sunday, paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the Monday and after visit to University for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session. The people who tend to hark on about about the problems of \"hardcore gaming\" seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game. I would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that.\nI used to be an EverQuest addict while I was in college. It came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one. I failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate. I was lucky that I came to my senses when I did, others were less fortunate and dropped out of college. Now that I am holding a job, I avoid online RPGS like the plague.\nWhen I was made redundant I told my partner I had a new job for three months whilst every day I played EverQuest from 7:30am till 5:pm. When She came home I pretended I had just got in as well, hence justifying playing it all evening. I have since quit playing MMORPG and have a good job.\nWhen I got to the point where I was eating my dinner in front of the PC I realised things were getting silly so I'm trying not to spend so much time on there. It's not easy. I feel as if I've got a real addiction going on here.\nFor me the problem is that I love to complete a goal. Once it is completed that is it, I am finished, time to move on. I become obsessed to complete the goal, so from that standpoint it is an addiction. In a game where you will never complete an \"ultimate\" goal, well it would be like falling into a black pit. It is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the PC game are \"easier\" and more fun than the real world. Pretty scary implications if you think about it.\nI can't buy World of Warcraft as it would destroy my marrage, I just know it!!\nI played Star Wars Galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games. They are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly, but this progress becomes exponentially slower, requiring more and more time to reach the next level. I'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction I was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor, slowly building up my character, stopping only for food and toilet breaks. Thankfully I made a clean break, and actually managed to sell my Jedi account for £800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum.\nSeven years ago, I began playing Ultima Online. This game dominated 2 years of my life. They were 2 wonderful years and I still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends I had. Online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others. Something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life. Whilst I would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games, I believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching TV.\nGaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction. When I was single I used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year, building up my stats, completing evermore quests and battling ogres. But somehow I found time to get out, even met someone and got married! Has my life changed? Hell no! I still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning. On with the fun!\nOnline gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.\nMany people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families, relationships and good careers. A minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted. According to this article the same is true of MMORPGs. The message to the government is clear, either legalise drugs, or outlaw online gaming!!\nSounds like there are some sad stories here - and I can believe them all. I play alot of Warcraft myself, and know full well how addictive it is. I am resolute that it will not take over my life. It certainly gets in the way though. I think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line, or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it.\nI think I'm obsessed with gaming in general, I spend far too much time playing games like Everquest 2 and Football Manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when I do try to, I'm always thinking in the back if my mind that I'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with Cambridge United.\nI am obsessed with online role playing games. It's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc. I spend about five hours per day online playing it and I rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning...\nAs many of the players spend their time in MMORPGs rather than in front of the TV I fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively. Furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect, whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature.\nThese games are like most things -- too much of anything is a bad thing, but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too, they can be great fun.\nLiving in Korea at the moment, they have lots PC Bangs (Internet Cafes). Nearly most of South Koreans are addicted to online games, and one Korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games.\nI play xbox live every day. I find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix. The longest I played was a 24 hour straight session. I know I play for to long but it's an obsession that I can't control. Can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up... but something I'm increasingly concerned with...\nMe and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a TV, trying to 'frag' some individual. It's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming, and enjoying 'real' life...\nI bought the US version of World of Warcraft when it came out. The longest period I played was 23 hrs straight. I gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive, but have subsequently just bought the European version (couldn't help myself). In future, I'm going to regulate my time far more strictly. Great game!\nHaving played MMORPG games for some years I agree that these type of games can be life sucking. But my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment. Most MMORPG games you need a credit card to play but I dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.\nUnless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person&#191;s health, you can expect this not to decline but to get worse.\nThese people are pathetic. They need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and \"online universe\" absolutely meaningless.\n24hours, when i was a kid at school and i was on half term, Ultima Online was the game, ahhhh them was the days ! LOL",
    "A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.\nFears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a £10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.\nThere were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. \"While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,\" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be £10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.\nEven without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.\nThe report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: \"There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. \"Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. \"The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.\" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.",
    "England have named Bath prop Matt Stevens in the starting line-up for their Six Nations match against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on Sunday.\nFellow Bath prop Duncan Bell will start on the bench, as coach Andy Robinson makes just one change to the team that was beaten by France. It will be Stevens' first start after two caps as a replacement against the All Blacks last year. Leicester duo Ollie Smith and Andy Goode have been drafted onto the bench. Stevens takes over from Phil Vickery, who suffered a broken arm playing for Gloucester last weekend. \"I'm confident Matt will grasp this opportunity and make his mark against Ireland,\" said Robinson.\n\"All three players have shown outstanding form of late, most recently in the England A win against France A and for their club,\" added Robinson. \"Selection beckons when players demonstrate such consistent ability. \"This game against Ireland will be massive. We recognise it's a must-win game for us this season.\" England confirmed that Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan was not considered for selection because of an injury he picked up to the back of his ankle during last Friday's match against Leeds.\nJ Robinson (Sale Sharks, capt); M Cueto (Sale Sharks), J Noon (Newcastle), O Barkley (Bath), J Lewsey (Wasps); C Hodgson (Sale Sharks), H Ellis (Leicester); G Rowntree (Leicester), S Thompson (Northampton), M Stevens (Bath), D Grewcock (Bath), B Kay (Leicester), J Worsley (Wasps), L Moody (Leicester), M Corry (Leicester).\nA Titterrell (Sale Sharks), D Bell (Bath), S Borthwick (Bath), A Hazell (Gloucester), M Dawson (Wasps), A Goode (Leicester), O Smith (Leicester).",
    "Rangers are set to loan out-of-favour midfielder Dragan Mladenovic to Real Sociedad, despite the closure of the January transfer window.\nSociedad have been given special permission by the Spanish FA to sign a player due to an injury crisis. Mladenovic will effectively replace former Rangers midfielder Mikel Arteta, who has been loaned to Everton. Sociedad say they will pay Rangers £150,000, with an option to buy the Serbia & Montenegro international. Mladenovic's loan move is subject to him passing a medical. The 28-year-old, who joined Rangers from Red Star Belgrade for £1.2m in the close season, is expected in San Sebastian later this week following his national side's game against Bulgaria. Sociedad are in 15th place in the 20-strong Primera Liga, just two points above the relegation zone. Special permission from the Spanish FA came after an injury to central defender Igor Jauregi. The versatile Mladenovic can also play in the back four. His agent said last month that Rangers had told him to find the player a new club. Mladenovic's time at Ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the Glasgow club.",
    "Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\nLabour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\nOn Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\nUKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\nUKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.",
    "The US looks set for a continued boost to interest rates in 2005, according to the Federal Reserve.\nMinutes of the December meeting which pushed rates up to 2.25% showed that policy-makers at the Fed are worried about accelerating inflation. The clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 GMT on Wednesday, but depressed US shares. \"The markets are starting to fear a more aggressive Fed in 2005,\" said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research. The Dow Jones index dropped almost 100 points on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq also falling as key tech stocks were hit by broker downgrades. The dollar also gained ground against sterling on Tuesday, reaching $1.8832 to the pound before slipping slightly on Wednesday morning.\nThe release of the minutes just three weeks after the 14 December meeting was much faster than usual, indicating the Fed wants to keep markets more apprised of its thinking. This, too, is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come. The key Fed funds rate has risen 1.25 percentage points during 2004 from the 46-year low of 1% reached not long after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. That long trough \"might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets\", said the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates. The odds now favour a further boost to rates at the next meeting in early February, economists said. But the respite for the dollar, which spent late 2003 being pushed lower against other major currencies by worries about massive US trade and budget deficits, may be short-lived. \"You can't rule out a further correction... but we don't think it's a change in direction in the dollar,\" said Jason Daw at Merrill Lynch. \"Nothing fundamental has changed.\"",
    "The Office's Ricky Gervais is writing an episode of hit US cartoon The Simpsons, following an invitation from its creator Matt Groening.\nGervais has already begun writing the script but is keeping its subject matter a closely guarded secret. He will also write a part for himself in the episode. \"I've got the rough idea but this is the most intimidating project of my career. The Simpsons is the greatest TV show of all time,\" he said. Groening recently heaped praise on The Office, saying: \"Everybody on The Simpsons is a fan of The Office - it's one of the best shows on TV in the last decade.\" Gervais has already said he would not guest star in the show as his Office character David, having left him behind for good in the Christmas specials. The Office became a surprise US success when it was screened on cable channel BBC America. The first series won two Golden Globes in 2004 for best comedy and best TV actor for Gervais.\nIn winning it beat the likes of Sex and the City and Will and Grace. An American version was produced, but so far only a pilot has been broadcast - to much criticism that it failed to live up to the original. At the British Comedy Awards on Wednesday, Gervais was handed a special achievement award for writing. But The Office missed out in the best comedy show category to Little Britain. Matt Groening was also at the awards to collect the award for best international comedy for The Simpsons.",
    "Fans who buy tickets for this year's Glastonbury festival will be issued with photo ID cards in an attempt to beat touts, it has been confirmed.\nThe cards will include a photograph of the ticket-holder plus an electronic chip with their details to prevent tickets being sold on or forged. Tickets for the June event are expected to go on sale in April. \"There is only one place in the world where you will be able to get tickets,\" festival organiser Michael Eavis said. \"That will be the official source. If you get them anywhere else, you won't get in.\" Fans not wanting to carry the entrance card could present their passport or driving licence instead, he added.\nMore than 153,000 people are expected to travel to Mr Eavis' Somerset farm from 24-26 June, but the event's rising popularity has meant an extremely high demand for tickets in recent years. When the ID card idea was floated, Mr Eavis' daughter Emily said it would be \"quite a big step in terms of ticketing for events\" if implemented and they were \"going as far as we can\" to cut touting. \"As long as it's approached in the right way, it might really work, it might really change the system,\" she said. In 2004, all 112,000 tickets for the public sold out in 24 hours. They were personalised with the names of purchasers, who were asked to bring identification, such as a driving licence, passport or household bill. But some forgot to take the right information while some touts simply offered to supply their own bills along with the ticket bearing their name. No details of this year's line-up have been confirmed but rumours have suggested U2 and Coldplay may be among the headliners.",
    "Ireland consigned England to their third straight Six Nations defeat with a stirring victory at Lansdowne Road.\nA second-half try from captain Brian O'Driscoll and 14 points from Ronan O'Gara kept Ireland on track for their first Grand Slam since 1948. England scored first through Martin Corry but had \"tries\" from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey disallowed. Andy Robinson's men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 World Cup final. The defeat also heralded England's worst run in the championship since 1987. Ireland last won the title, then the Five Nations, in 1985, but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with Wales. And Eddie O'Sullivan's side banished the ghosts of 2003 when England were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the Grand Slam at Lansdowne Road. In front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in Dublin, Ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when O'Gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.\nEngland took their time to settle but their first real venture into Ireland's half produced a simple score for Corry. The number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the Irish line, racing 25 yards to touch down. England fly-half Charlie Hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately O'Gara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalties in quick succession. England were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes, and Hodgson, the villain at Twickenham, coolly bisected the posts. The first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking, but it was Ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. A series of probes led by the talismanic O'Driscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but Ireland chose to kick for touch.\nFrom the line-out, the ball was recycled back to O'Gara, who stroked his second drop-goal, this time off the right upright. As the interval approached, wing Josh Lewsey was the catalyst for England's most promising attack. The Wasps star raced up his touchline and Hodgson's cross-kick put in Mark Cueto for an apparent score, but the Sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. England began the second half well and had Ireland pinned in their own half. But another English indiscretion on a rare Irish break-out awarded O'Gara a kick at goal, which he missed. England's pressure continued, and a wave of attacks saw centre Jamie Noon dragged down yards from the line before Hodgson landed a drop-goal.\nThe lead was shortlived, however. Ireland raced upfield, deft handling from the backs, including a clever dummy from Geordan Murphy on Hodgson, ending with O'Driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. O'Gara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgson's cross-kick was fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line. Anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high, but O'Gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. Inside the last 10 minutes, England poured forward, spurred on by scrum-half Matt Dawson, who replaced Leicester's Harry Ellis. But despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the TV replay by referee Jonathan Kaplan - England were unable to pull off a face-saving win. Ireland next face France at Lansdowne Road in two weeks' time before the potential title decider against Wales in Cardiff.

    "Aston Villa boss David O'Leary signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension on Thursday, securing his future at the club until summer 2008.\nO'Leary's future was in question, but Villa chairman Doug Ellis said he was happy to secure the deal. \"David's record since his arrival in 2003 is excellent and he shares the board's amibitions in taking this club forward,\" he told Villa's website. \"For this reason it was important we got this right.\" O'Leary put pen to paper after deals were sorted for his right-hand men Roy Aitken and Steve McGregor. \"It was important to me Roy and Steve, an integral part of my team, should stay for the same time,\" O'Leary said on Thursday ahead of signing his new deal. \"Someone has to try and put Aston Villa back where they should belong and I'm up for the challenge.\"Earlier in December, there were rumours O'Leary would quit if he is not offered a new deal before the end of the season.\nBut he denied that, saying he was happy to take on the challenge of improving Villa's fortunes in the long term. \"I want to make sure by the end of the five years I would have been in charge that Villa are achieving top six finishes in the Premiership on a regular basis,\" said O'Leary, who took over at Villa Park in May 2003. \"But to achieve that, and take the next step forward, we do need to bring in quality players. \"I would like a couple next month if at all possible to set us on the way.\" Meanwhile, O'Leary has rapped skipper Olof Mellberg for his comments before Sunday's derby with Birmingham.\nMellberg spoke of his dislike of Villa's rivals ahead of the match, which Steve Bruce's side won 2-1. \"I've had more than a quiet word with Olof. It's been said within the whole group, not as a one-to-one,\" he told Villa's website. \"You shouldn't leave yourself open to be shot down. You shouldn't give people the chance to take cheap shots at you and he set himself up for that.\"",
    "Kim Clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of January's Australian Open because of her persistent wrist injury.\nOpen chief Paul McNamee had said: \"Kim's wrist obviously isn't going to be rehabilitated.\" But her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry. \"The doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. But if there's the least risk she will stay away.\" Despite being absent from the WTA entry list for the tournament, which begins on 17 January, Clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. Clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. The Belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. Meanwhile, Jelena Dokic, who used to compete for Australia, has opted out of the first Grand Slam of the season. Dokic has not played in the Australian Open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. But the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. Four-time champion Monica Seles, who has not played since last year's French Open, is another absentee because of an injured left foot.",
    "The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.\nPoliticians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.\nHugo Lueders, European director for public policy at CompTIA, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration.",

    "Marion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe Sydney Olympic gold medallist says Conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: \"I stand by everything I said\". Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she \"has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs\". Conte's statements, the suit added, were \"false and malicious\". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: \"Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. \"Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America's most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte's statements have been wildly contradictory. \"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.\n\"Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.\" The sport's ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte's allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte \"for further information\". But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte's television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.",
    "Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said his side's task against AC Milan would not be made any easier by the absence of Andriy Shevchenko.\nMilan's talismanic European footballer of the year misses Wednesday's Champions League first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone. \"It's a loss (to Milan), but it could be worse if they didn't have such quality to bring in,\" Ferguson said. \"How much they miss him I think they'll know tomorrow night.\" Ferguson said Milan's front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders. \"They can play Rui Costa and play Kaka forward. They can bring Serginho in and they can play (Jon Dahl) Tomasson,\" he said. Ferguson's own goalscoring talisman Ruud van Nistelrooy is fit again, but the Scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the Dutchman, who has not played for three months.\n\"Ruud is the best striker in Europe. What I have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long,\" he said. \"His ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision.\" Ferguson, though, is confident his young players, particularly Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, are up to the task. \"We have an opportunity to win this cup this year, no question about that,\" he declared. \"With the maturity we see every week in Ronaldo and Rooney, the return of Van Nistelrooy and the form of Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, we must have a fantastic chance.\" It is a view shared by Rooney, who believes \"if we can get past Milan, we have a great chance\". \"As soon as I knew we were playing Milan, I got excited. Looking at the draw, it is anyone's trophy but we have every chance. \"Hopefully, we can get to that final in Turkey and bring the cup back to Manchester.\" Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted Europe's most prestigious club title two seasons ago. Milan beat Juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at Old Trafford and Ancelotti said: \"We are all very happy to return (to Old Trafford) to play in the Champions League and this will give us great motivation.\" Ancelotti said he was aware of the threat United posed to his hopes of Champions League glory. \"It's fundamental that we don't allow them to take control of the game.

    "Georgia is offering a one-off 'tax amnesty' to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze.\nThe country's new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax. The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia's flagging economy. Georgia's black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.\nMr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era, and boost Georgia's fragile public finances.\nThe new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected. \"There are people who have money but are afraid to show it,\" the president told a government session. \"Documentation about where this money came from doesn't exist because under the former, entirely warped regime, earning capital honestly was not possible.\"\nBy declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to \"legalise their property\", Mr Saakashvili stressed.\n\"No one will have the right to check this money's origin. This money must go back into the economy.\" The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of Georgian businesses -are to continue. Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in November, of allowing bribery to flourish. Georgia's economy is in a desperate condition. Half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4, or three euros, a day.

    "The reported feud between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has prompted a Labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.\nDuncan Bannatyne also attacked the government over Iraq and its \"poor\" response to the Asian tsunami crisis. His broadside came as ex-Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he hoped Mr Brown would be premier at some point. Mr Bannatyne has previously given Labour £50,000. He made his fortune from care homes and health clubs.\nThe 52-year-old on Tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of Cabinet disunity and international issues. His spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give Labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the Conservatives.\nRobert Peston's new book has prompted more speculation about the Blair-Brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. Mr Bannatyne said: \"Disunity in the Cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country. \"Gordon Brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy, but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition.\" The businessman, whose latest venture is a casino in Newcastle, also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in Iraq.\nAnd he branded the UK government's response to the tsunami as \"piecemeal and poor\". \"The people there need practical help not just pledges of money,\" he said. \"The US has forces helping on the ground - we can do more.\" British Navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. Mr Bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on BBC2 business start-up programme Dragon's Den. But his spokesman insisted his attack on Labour was not a publicity stunt.\nIn a separate development, Robin Cook gave his support to Mr Brown's prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be Labour's election. But he insisted the recent squabbles between Mr Blair and Mr Brown were not \"perceived as a problem by the voters,\" adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. Mr Cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was \"not an alternative source of opposition to the government\". He warned the \"Abstentions Party\" was the real challenge to Labour - and they would not be motivated by Mr Blair's promise to produce an \"unremittingly New Labour\" election manifesto. His comments come after Dave Prentis, the leader of Britain's biggest union Unison, told the Daily Record newspaper he wants a date to be set for Mr Blair to be replaced as Labour leader.",
    "Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange.\nSpeaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai, he said a full listing was \"one of the options\" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium. The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.\nWhen Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time. The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing. \"When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,\" Mr Dein said.\n\"Listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. \"We want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), Manchester United have been a success.\"\nMr Dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. Since the formation of the Premier League in season 1992/93, Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. \"Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition. \"We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline, and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too. \"I think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes I think less is more.\"\nThe club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium. It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets, including Asia. \"We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs, and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too, as they are around the world. \"We have got a very good product, so it is very important we go and look at these markets, and make sure we are on the case.\"",

Mind you, every time she breaks the record she gets $30,000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes. She looked good and was very positive. Agnes Samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly. My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid. He started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.\nIt would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis-Francis could have done in the final, if only he hadn't got himself disqualified. He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. My view is you're meant to go when the gun goes and not before. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. Having said that, Mark is looking in much better shape. But I haven't seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans. From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.\nSomething else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships. Scotland's Lee McConnell is probably going to run too, so we have a real prospect of a medal. From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great. Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money. She had a go but just could not hang in there. We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape. As for Kenenisa Bekele, he was well beaten by Markos Geneti. But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season. It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.",
    "Film star Robert De Niro has returned to the top of the North American box office with his film Hide and Seek.\nThe thriller shot straight to the number one spot after taking $22m (£11.7m) at the box office. De Niro recently spent three weeks at the top with comedy Meet The Fockers, which was at number five this week. Oscar hopefuls The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Sideways all cashed in on their multiple nominations with stronger ticket sales.\nIn Hide and Seek, De Niro plays a widower whose daughter has a creepy imaginary friend. Despite lukewarm reviews from critics, the film took more than the expected $18m (£9.5m). \"The element of a real actor in a psychological thriller certainly elevated it,\" said Bruce Snyder, president of domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox. Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby led the Oscar hopefuls with $11.8m (£6.3m), coming in at number three during its first weekend of wide release. The Aviator, a film biography of Howard Hughes that leads the Oscar field with 11 nominations, was at number six for the weekend with $7.5m (£4m). Oscar best-picture nominee Sideways entered the top ten for the first time in its 15th week of release. It came in seventh $6.3 (£3.35m). Last week's top film, Ice Cube's road-trip comedy Are We There Yet?, slipped to second place with $17m (£9m), while Coach Carter fell two places to number four, taking $8m (£4.25m) in its third week. Rounding out the top ten were In Good Company - starring Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson - Racing Stripes and Assault on Precinct 13.",
    "Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini will miss Sunday's Carling Cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against Newcastle.\nThe Italian was sent off for bringing down Shola Ameobi in the final minute of Sunday's match. Blues boss Jose Mourinho had promised to pick Cudicini for the final instead of first-choice keeper Petr Cech. The 31-year-old will now serve a one-match suspension commencing with immediate effect.\nCudicini kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for Chelsea, but Petr Cech has established himself as first choice for Mourinho since moving to Stamford Bridge in summer 2004. The 22-year-old Czech Republic international has set a new Premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal, a mark which is still running. But Mourinho has used Cudicini regularly in the Carling Cup, and the Italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during Chelsea's run to the final.",
    "TV, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.\nIt is called high-definition - HD for short - and it is already hugely popular in Japan and the US. It is set, according to analysts, to do for images what CDs did for sound. Different equipment able to receive HD signals is needed though and is expensive. But Europe's gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. Europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream HDTV.\nTo view it, it needs to be transmitted in HD format, and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. The next generation of consoles, however, are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005, start of 2006. And most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures. \"In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory,\" Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website. \"Every game is going to be playable in HD. \"So consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on HDTVs, and who have no content to watch, are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures. \"It's going to change really the way they look at gaming.\"\nAt the end of last year, Chris Deering, Sony's European president, made a prediction that 20 million European households would have HDTV sets by 2008. A previous prediction from analysts Datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003. But those in Europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. Satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006 and the BBC intends to produce all of its content in HD by 2010.\nUntil broadcast rights, format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed, TV content will be limited. All TV images are made up of pixels which go across the screen, and scan lines which go down the screen. Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. HD offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. This means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard TV. \"Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this TV can do', until HD is really adopted by broadcasters,\" explains Dr Tuffy. But gamers are also the ideal target audience for HD because they always crave better quality graphics, and more immersive gaming experiences. They are used to spending money on hardware to match a game's requirements. Demographics have changed too and the \"sweet spot\" for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. This means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen, high-definition display technologies and HD projectors, earlier than others.\nHigher capacity storage discs, such as HD-DVD and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.\nFor console developers though, HD offers some production changes. It could make games production slightly more expensive, thinks Dr Tuffy. \"But we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console,\" he says. \"You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD. \"And the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game, just now they have almost got it seamless.\" With HD, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. This could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. But it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. At that point, says Dr Tuffy, games could become more or less interactive movies.",
    "Has there been a better Six Nations match than Saturday's epic in Paris?\nAnd can the Welsh revival continue all the way to a first Grand Slam since 1978? Those are the two questions occupying not just Wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in Paris. Welsh legend Mervyn Davies, a member of two of three Grand Slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as \"one of the great performances of the past three decades\". Martyn Williams, Wales' two-try scorer on the day, called it \"one of the most surreal games I have ever played in\". A crestfallen France coach, Bernard Laporte, simply observed: \"There was a French half and there was a Welsh half\". And what a half it was for the Red Dragonhood, transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. But while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure, the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this Welsh side. That they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time, then reverse it on the resumption, was remarkable enough. But in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of French pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes, Wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.\nIn international rugby, any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day, but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. England suffered some infamous Six Nations disappointments en route to World Cup glory, the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. Wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. But the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. Ten of the 22 on duty on Saturday were also involved when Wales were trounced 33-5 in Paris two years ago. But since they threw off the shackles against New Zealand in the 2003 World Cup, Wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.\n\"The confidence in the squad has been building and building since the World Cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class,\" noted coach Mike Ruddock. The likes of Michael Owen, Gethin Jenkins, Dwayne Peel and Gavin Henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer's Lions tour to New Zealand. And players like Stephen Jones, Martyn Williams, Shane Williams and Gareth Thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. Jones, after his superb man-of-the-match display, observed that \"we are a very happy camp now\". Ruddock and Thomas can take much of the credit for that, ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred Welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. The\njoie de vivre\nso evident in that magical second-half spell in Paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.\nIf England had half the innate attacking exuberance Wales have produced in this championship, they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. Similarly, Wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches, and that forward power, mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. So on to Murrayfield, where Wales have not won on their last three visits. While the hype in the Principality will go into overdrive, the players will set about the task of beating Scotland. Only then - with the visit of Ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s, and writing their own names into Welsh legend.",
    "The Conservatives have been \"a lot smarter\" in the way they have conducted the general election campaign, a Labour backbencher has said.\nDerek Wyatt said having a five month campaign \"turned off voters\" and suggested people were already \"rather bored of the thing\". He wants a greater campaigning role for Chancellor Gordon Brown. Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role. But Mr Wyatt argued: \"By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. \"So, it would be a tad foolish of the Labour Party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections.\"\nLabour's election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda. However, Mr Wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget. The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been \"trying very hard\" to improve his own standing with the electorate through a \"sort of campaign of trust\". But Mr Blair had been \"hurt\" by the Iraq controversy, he added. A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role. \"This election is a choice between Labour taking Britain forward and the Conservatives taking us back.\"",
    "Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in Parliament.\nTories, Lib Dems and some Labour MPs are poised to vote against the plans. Mr Clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. Opponents say only judges, not politicians, should be able to order detention of UK citizens. The government is expected to win Wednesday's vote in the Commons, but faces a battle in the House of Lords.\nThe Prevention of Terrorism Bill was published on Tuesday. It proposes \"control orders\", which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases, and curfews, electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.\nThe two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary, rather than a judge. Tory shadow home secretary David Davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice, like the Guildford Four - for which Tony Blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects. \"Those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that's why we have serious concerns abut that approach,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nMr Clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. He also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. The foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at London's Belmarsh prison. They are held under laws which the Law Lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 March.\nThe new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the Law Lords' concerns, would apply to British as well as foreign terror suspects. Critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive UK citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. Opposition MPs are also angry they will have only two days - Wednesday and next Monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the House of Lords. But the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently.\nIn a rare move, the Tories and Lib Dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill, saying the house arrest plans are \"excessive\". It argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan \"wrongly infringes the right to liberty\" by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. Mr Davis told Today: \"It gives a minister, for the first time in modern history, the right to detain without trial, without showing the evidence and indeed, in some respects, almost the allegation against the individual concerned.\"\nHe questioned why there was \"such a rush\" to introduce the legislation when Mr Clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"We believe it should be the judge that takes decisions, not politicians.\" Mr Clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be \"rash and negligent\" to ignore their advice. Nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the UK and its interests, he argued.",
    "A TV station in the US has refused to show a controversial new series where adopted children try and pick their birth father - and win a cash prize.\nThe WRAZ-TV Fox affiliate in North Carolina was the only one of 182 stations to refuse Monday's show. Who's Your Daddy promises $100,000 (£52,000) to the contestant if she correctly identifies her father. It was met with protests by the National Council for Adoption, which said it \"exploits\" sensitive emotions. \"It exploits the sensitive emotions of adoption,\" said Thomas Atwood, president of the National Council for Adoption. \"It trivialises them. Adoption is a very personal, meaningful experience and it should not be commercialised like this.\" On the pre-taped programme, the contestant is presented with eight men who may or may not be her natural father.\nIf she picks the correct man from the line-up, the contestant wins the jackpot prize of US$100,000 (£52,590). However, if she picks the wrong man, then the impostor takes the money. Fox producers defended the show, saying it was a \"positive experience\". They have made six specials, though only one episode has so far been broadcast.\n\"The special was thoroughly vetted by our standards and practices department to ensure that it was appropriate for broadcast,\" said a Fox spokesman. \"However, any network affiliate that feels the programming may be inappropriate for their individual market has the right to pre-empt the schedule.\" WRAZ-TV instead chose to air an independently-produced film, I Have Roots and Branches... Personal Reflections on Adoption, a documentary about families with adopted children. \"We just don't think adoption is a game show,\" said Tommy Schenck, WRAZ-TV's general manager, though he said his decision had not been influenced by public protests.",
    "Chelsea's win at Fulham - confirming their position at the Premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season.\nThey have got strength in depth, great players, an outstanding manager in Jose Mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match. All they need to add now is the big prizes which, as we all know, is the most difficult part of all. One thing is certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed. They beat a very tough Everton at Stamford Bridge, won at Newcastle in the Carling Cup, and then won 4-1 at Fulham, which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. As I said, winning the major honours is the hardest task of all, but in Mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now. Mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all, the Champions League, and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players. It is a priceless commodity. No-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by Mourinho. He is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people, and maybe he can appear that way, but he has the silverware to back up the talk. Mourinho doesn't simply talk a good game - he's won some very big games such as the Champions League final with Porto. Some may criticise his talk, but the words are backed up with actions. I've also found him to be very realistic whenever I've heard him. He's spent a lot of money and it seems to be working, and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked. The buys are now integrating, and in Arjen Robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension.\nIn the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics, and yet he was winning games. You cannot win titles early on in the season, but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital. I also thought the criticism was very harsh, because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful. Now they are taking those chances, have the double threat of Robben and Damien Duff, and things are looking good. I just wonder if they lack a predator, particularly with Didier Drogba injured. He was starting to look the part before he was sidelined, but you have to feel if Chelsea had a Ruud van Nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title. Chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the Champions League. I felt they would never have a better chance than last season, but they have swept all before them in Europe so far this season. It will now be very interesting to see how Mourinho prioritises things, but his life will be made easier by the size of Chelsea's squad. I have said I believed Chelsea would win the league this season, even when Arsenal were flying at the start, and I have seen nothing to make me change me mind.\nIf anything, what I have seen has confirmed my early impressions. And Chelsea would have taken encouragement from Arsenal's rocky defensive display at Spurs, even though they ran out 5-4 winners. Mourinho had his say on that game, complaining: \"Five-four is a hockey score, not a football score. \"In a three-against-three training match, if the score reaches 5-4 I send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly. \"So to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful.\"\nOn a more serious note, it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of Sol Campbell to Arsenal. Much criticism has been aimed at Pascal Cygan, but I believe the problem lies with the absence of Campbell and its overall effect on Arsenal's defence. Confidence is a crucial factor in defending. When you start conceding goals, you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area. You think \"oh no\" - then find your worst fears confirmed. Arsenal need to reverse the process, with or without Campbell, and get some clean sheets on the board. But the return of Campbell is key. He solidifies the unit, has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck. He is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him. Campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit. Chelsea have no such problems at present, which is why I would still place my money on them to edge out Arsenal as champions this season.",
    "Prime Minister Tony Blair purchased two copies of the charity single Band Aid 20 in Edinburgh on Friday.\nStaff were surprised when the Prime Minister walked into HMV at 0900 GMT, accompanied by aides and local police. \"When Mr Blair came in unannounced, we were all pretty gobsmacked,\" said HMV manager Clive Smith. \"Our customer helper approached him... it was only then we realised he wanted to buy copies of the Band Aid single, rather than the latest Eminem album.\" Predicted chart-topper Do They Know it's Christmas? is expected to sell at least 300,000 copies by the time the new chart is announced on Sunday. However, the new version of the 1984 single is not going to be released in the US, despite being sold in many countries around the world. US record shops are stocking an import version of Do They Know It's Christmas, which is said to be selling very well in Los Angeles and New York. The original track was released in the US, and reached number 13 in the singles chart. British stars who appear on the current recording, such as Dido and Coldplay's Chris Martin, are well-known to music fans across the Atlantic, along with U2 frontman Bono.\nRecord company Universal is responsible for the global distribution of the single, which will be available across Europe, Asia, South America and Canada. But music fans in the US are still able to access the song and download it on Band Aid 20's official website. In 1985, a group of high-profile American stars known as USA For Africa came together to record their own fund-raising single, We Are The World. The song was written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, with Quincy Jones as producer. It topped the US charts for three weeks and went on win Grammy awards for best record and song.\nDionne Warwick, Diana Ross and Tina Turner were among the line-up of performers. It is predicted that the Band Aid 20 song will sell 300,000 copies in the UK by the time the new chart is announced on Sunday. The record is also tipped to become this year's Christmas number one, as the original version did in 1984. Proceeds from the sales are going towards relief for the Darfur region of Sudan and to combat HIV and Aids across Africa.",

The News of the World reports that Anelka told a French magazine: \"I either decide to win titles or to have an easy life. \"I think I will always choose football, if a great club makes me an offer.\" He added: \"To win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so. If we stagnate between eighth and 15th place it's impossible to progress. \"If I am going to score goals and not win, there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up.\" Anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris St Germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him.\n\"I am in talks to sign an extension to my contract,\" he said. \"I am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account. \"Playing for eighth place is good but I miss the Champions League. \"I won it with Real Madrid in 2000 and I need to be playing in it - and I should be playing in it. \"I'm not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football. \"But I don't blame anyone.

    "Sir Alex Ferguson has called on the Football Association to punish Arsenal's Thierry Henry for an incident involving Gabriel Heinze.\nFerguson believes Henry deliberately caught Heinze on the head with his knee during United's controversial win. The United boss said it was worse than Ruud van Nistelrooy's foul on Ashley Cole for which he got a three-game ban. \"We shall present it to the FA and see what they do. The tackle on Heinze was terrible,\" he said. Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. The clash occurred moments before half-time when a Freddie Ljungberg challenge left Heinze on the ground on the left touchline. Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinze's head.\nThe striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental. Ferguson was also upset by Arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side's behaviour. \"Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker,\" he said. \"There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge. \"I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. \"We have always been good at being gracious in defeat. What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, don't they?\"",
    "Hollywood film star Liam Neeson has held a dinner party in New York to promote Belfast's Lyric Theatre.\nThe Ballymena-born actor said that the theatre on Ridgeway Street was in a \"very dilapidated condition\". Lyric chairman David Johnston has said that rebuilding the theatre, at a cost of £8m is the only answer. Mr Neeson said that the idea was to get a bunch of \"healthy, wealthy Irish Americans\" in one room and ask them to help with fundraising.\nThe Oscar-nominated actor, whose films include Schindler's List, Michael Collins and Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, said: \"The Lyric is too important to the cultural and social life of Northern Ireland for this building to crumble and fall apart. \"It gave me a start professionally. Mary O'Malley, the founder of the theatre, gave me my future. \"In those days, in the mid-70s, when I was there, we were doing a play every four weeks. \"Belfast was not a pretty town to be living in. \"There was serious trouble, as you know, but this theatre was like a Belisha beacon of light and hope six nights a week, doing everything from Shakespeare to Yeats to O'Casey with a group of actors and actresses that affected me very deeply and still do.\" The Lyric began 50 years ago but the doors opened at its present site on the Stranmillis embankment overlooking the River Lagan in 1968.\nAs well as Liam Neeson, it also launched the careers of Adrian Dunbar and Stephen Rea and playwrights such as Martin Lynch and Gary Mitchell. Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland before the event at New York's SoHo House, Mr Neeson said that his spirit belonged to the Glens of Antrim. And he said that there was one figure from his childhood that he would love to portray on the big screen - Ian Paisley. He said that the DUP leader and preacher was a \"very dynamic, extraordinary figure\". Neeson used to listen to his sermons on a Friday night in Ballymena. He said: \"What an orator. He was from that old school of bible-thumping righteousness. But it was so dramatic. I found him very powerful. \"I'd love to get a chance to play him some time.\"",
    "Your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future?\nGifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact.

The first vouchers, worth £250 or £500 for low-income families, will be distributed from January. All children born after 1st September 2002 will be eligible. Parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in April 2005.\nParents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.\nThere are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. Some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the Ladybird account from the Saffron Walden Building Society, paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of £1 and the Alliance & Leicester FirstSaver which pays 5.25%, also starting at £1.\nInterest earned by children is subject to income tax. However, children, like adults, have a personal income tax allowance (£4,745 for the current tax year).\nIf the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. As long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance, then no tax will be payable. When the account is opened a form \"R85\", available from the bank or building society, should be completed. This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.\nThe tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. Only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children's names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. Therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.\nAnother favourite solution is Premium Bonds. With the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account, they make great presents. The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. Any prizes will be sent to the parent or child's guardian. The minimum for each purchase is £100 and Bonds are sold in multiples of £10.\nThere are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.\nOver the longer term, stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment, although in the shorter term they can be volatile. One of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. These are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. These funds may be actively managed, where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential, or passive, where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index, for example, the FTSE 100. Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. These are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). The difference is that the charges are quite low. The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent. For larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.",
    "The International Monetary Fund is to cut its 2005 growth forecast for the German economy from 1.8% to 0.8%, the Financial Times Deutschland reported.\nThe IMF will also reduce its growth estimate for the 12-member eurozone economy from 2.2% to 1.6%, the newspaper reported. The German economy has been faltering, with unemployment levels rising to a seventy-year high of 5.2 million. Its sluggish performance continues to hamper the entire eurozone.\nThe IMF's draft World Economic Outlook - due to be published in April - would point to a marked deterioration in Germany's economy, the FT report said.\nIn September, the IMF had said that German growth for the current year would be 1.8%. The IMF has also revised eurozone forecasts, the paper said, taking into account high oil prices, the strength of the euro and weak demand in many of the world's leading economies. Europe's economic difficulties have been highlighted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which argued in a report published on Tuesday that the continent could only achieve US living standards by freeing up its labour markets. \"The eurozone does not look like it has a self-sustaining recovery,\" James Carrick, an economist with ABN Amro, told the newspaper. \"It is too dependant on the rest of the world.\"",
    "Video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom.\nWith violent titles continuing to top the charts, gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. Recent research by the London Institute of Education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom. \"Games teach life skills such as decision making, problem solving,\" said Martin Owen, at Futurelab. Mr Owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error.\nFuturelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. Most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but Liverpool-based games firm Lateral Visions saw a gap in the market. \"Learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn't see anyone else doing what we wanted to do,\" said Dr Carl Gavin, managing director of Lateral Visions. The company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. The result is Racing Academy, a massively multiplayer car racing game, which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well.\nIt is being used by Futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. \"We are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game, we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational,\" said Mr Owen. Players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. The game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs, before and after racing. Teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data, work collaboratively and review their own performances. This fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to Futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved, thinks Mr Owen.\nThe game has been trialled in two secondary schools in Bristol and feedback from students has been positive. \"Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other,\" said Ben Williamson, a researcher at Futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. Dr Gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers' need for learning outcomes and the children's desire to rise to a challenge. \"Games in the classroom need to support the teacher. It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge,\" he said. Professor Angela MacFarlane, based at Bristol University, has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms.\nUse of games in schools has been patchy she found, with Sim City proving the most popular. Traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun, she found in her research. \"It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies,\" she wrote in a paper entitled Games and Learning. 'Lite' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. This would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. Already there are games on the market, such as Civilisation and Age of Empire, that have educational elements said Mr Owen. \"Even in Grand Theft Auto it is not just the violence that engages people,\" he said. It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though.",
    "Microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine.\nThe now formally launched MSN search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in November 2003. The revamped engine indexes more pages than before, can give direct answers to factual questions, and features tools to help people create detailed queries. Microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries.\nGoogle still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query, keep up with news or search for images. But in the last year Google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals, such as Yahoo and Microsoft, and new entrants such as Amazon and Blinkx, try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves. This renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page, recipe, book, gadget, news story, image or anything else. Microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to Google. To generate its corpus of data, Microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days - more often than rivals. The Microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer.\nFor its direct answer feature, Microsoft is calling on its Encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions, facts, calculations, conversions and solutions to equations. Tony Macklin, director of product at Ask Jeeves, pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since April 2003. \"The major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search, so in many ways Microsoft is following the market,\" he said. Tools sitting alongside the MSN search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites, countries, regions or languages. Microsoft is also using so-called \"graphic equalisers\" that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up-to-date or more popular. The company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system. The test, or beta, version of the MSN search engine unveiled in November had a few teething troubles. On its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed.",
    "Rock star Ozzy Osbourne has said his family will not make any more episodes of reality TV show The Osbournes.\n\"At the end of it I didn't like having cameras around the house all the time,\" the Black Sabbath singer told reporters at the MTV Europe Awards in Rome. His wife Sharon, who also appears in the popular MTV show based on the Osbournes' family life, agreed. \"Now everybody's doing reality shows. He's done it, he's been there, he's got to do something else,\" she said.\nOzzy Osbourne said he had had enough of the work involved in making the series. \"When you watch a 25-minute episode, I've been filming all day,\" he said. Sharon Osbourne is currently appearing as a judge and mentor in ITV1 talent show The X-Factor alongside Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh.\nEarlier this year she topped a poll of the most important people in rock, for her part in guiding the career of husband Ozzy and her family. She was the driving force behind The Osbournes, which ran for three series, earning the family a reported $85m (£46m). The renewed popularity for Ozzy has seen sales of his merchandise hit the $50m (£27.2m) mark, a record for a heavy metal artist. Sales of T-shirts, accessories and action figures have rocketed since The Osbournes hit screens. At its peak, The Osbournes had a regular audience of eight million, with America's TV Guide magazine describing the series as \"a cross between The Simpsons and This Is Spinal Tap\". Osbourne himself was at a loss to explain its popularity: \"I suppose Americans get a kick out of watching a crazy Brit family like us make complete fools of ourselves every week.\"",
    "Despite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report.\nUnemployment stood at 25%, compared with 10% before the uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago. Young people are particularly hard hit with 37% out of work, compared with 14% four years ago. But 104,000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures. However, during the first half of this year, the Palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs. Last year's growth rate of 6% can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence, the report said. According to the report, Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems. The closures arranged by Israel restrict the movement of Palestinian people and goods, slowing down trade.\n\"Closures are a key factor behind today's economic crisis in the West Bank,\" said Nigel Roberts, World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza. Nearly half of all Palestinians - some 47% - live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks. The report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation. It also called on the Palestinian Authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment-friendly climate. This week Colin Powell, US Secretary of State was visiting the West Bank to stress US support for a smooth Palestinian election in January.",
    "Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the Primera Liga club for the second time in his career.\nThe decision was taken at a board meeting following the side's surprise elimination from the Uefa Cup. \"We understand, and he understands, that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate,\" said club president Juan Bautista. Former assistant Antonio Lopez will take over as the new coach. Italian Ranieri took over the Valencia job in June 2004 having been replaced at Chelsea by Jose Mourinho.\nThings began well but the Spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to Racing Santander last weekend. That defeat was then followed by a Uefa Cup exit at the hands of Steaua Bucharest. Ranieri first took charge of Valencia in 1997, guiding them to the King's Cup and helping them to qualify for the Champions League. The 54-year-old then moved to Atletico Madrid in 1999, before joining Chelsea the following year.",
    "A slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler.\nThe German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003. Mercedes-Benz's woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.\nMercedes' profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003's 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. Sales of Mercedes' brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar.\nThe carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range. Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes' position as the world's most successful luxury brand. However, DaimlerChrysler's shares fell 1.5% on the news. \"While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz,\" Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters.\nIn contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%. The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.\nOverall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. Chrysler's strong performance helped the world's fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.\n\"The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment,\" said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman. DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso. DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso. Looking forward, DaimerChrysler's profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. However, it is expecting \"significant improvements\" in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.",
    "German airline Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003.\nIn a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; £274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003. Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. It was also hit by troubles at its US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend. The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 March.",
    "A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.\nContrack International, of Arlington, Virginia, heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. Its withdrawal from the $325m (£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon's Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack's management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\nUS firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"",
    "The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says.\nJavier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other European countries. Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge. But Home Secretary Charles Clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: \"[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it. \"It would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal.\" Mr Solana's comments come the day after Sir Ian Blair, the newly-appointed Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence.\nUnder the Anti-Terrorism Crimes and Security Act 2001, foreign terror suspects can be detained in British jails without trial or charge. Several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.\nSome of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. Human Rights group Liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard, these detainees could be brought to trial. But critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services. The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance. But Mr Clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after Law Lords ruled it illegal. He has opted for a system of \"control orders\" whereby suspects, both British and foreign, can be held under house arrest or surveillance. These orders will again involve a UK opt-out of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights. While accepting that people \"have to be prepared\" for a possible terrorist attack, Mr Solana said he had \"qualms\" about the home secretary's new plans. \"We have to fight terrorism with all our means, but not so far as to change our way of life,\" he said.",

In 1995 he directed an episode of the medical drama ER and has also appeared in Alias.\nMs Mendelsohn said the production team had been trying for a while to get Tarantino to direct an episode of CSI, and added that he was a fan of the forensic drama. She said he finally agreed a few weeks ago while CSI was doing some location shooting in Las Vegas and the show's stars persuaded him. \"He knows everything there is to know about CSI, and he is into the whole mythology of CSI,\" Mendelsohn said. \"Quentin came in a couple of weeks ago. We had a story meeting with the writers. \"He had a great idea, and it was so much fun to have him in the room... we are positively giddy.\" Filming is due to start in early April and the Tarantino-directed episode will be broadcast in the US on 19 May.",
    "Leicester withstood a stunning Wasps comeback to win a pulsating Heineken Cup encounter at the Causeway Stadium.\nThe Tigers stormed 22-6 ahead within 18 minutes through tries from Lewis Moody, Geordan Murphy and Martin Corry. European champions Wasps fought back through a Josh Lewsey try and Mark van Gisbergen's boot, and they were level at 31-31 with five minutes remaining. But it was the visitors who kept their cool as Andy Goode kicked the Tigers to victory with a penalty and a drop goal. The closing moments saw desperate defence from Leicester as Wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed. Wasps pounded the line and a penalty try looked likely before referee Nigel Williams controversially blew for full-time. Fly-half Goode was the Tigers hero, kicking 22 points in total, while Leicester's overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told. Even their lack of discipline in defence - which presented the admirable Van Ginsberg with 26 points - could not undo them as they held out for a famous win.\nLawrence Dallaglio's team have now got it all to do in the quest for a quarter-final place given that two of their last three games are away - against Leicester and Biarritz. However, Wasps rugby director Warren Gatland warned his side will will not relinquish their European title without a fight. \"If we lose next week, then we are struggling,\" said Gatland. \"But we don't want to give this trophy away. We worked so hard to win it last season, we will go down fighting. \"We have got to get our scrum right next week, it is the biggest cause for concern.\" Leicester coach John Wells saluted the outstanding work of Graham Rowntree and Julian White, who were magnificent up front. \"They were the backbone of our performance today,\" said Wells. \"And to score three tries against the European champions at home was also something I am pleased about.\"\nVan Gisbergen; Lewsey, Erinle, Abbott, Voyce; King, Dawson; Dowd, Greening, Green; Shaw, Birkett; Worsley, O'Connor, Dallaglio (capt).\nReplacements: Gotting, McKenzie, Lock, Hart, Biljon, Brooks, Hoadley.\nMurphy; Rabeni, Smith, Gibson, Healey; Goode, Ellis; Rowntree, Chuter, White, M Johnson (capt), L Deacon; Moody, Back, Corry.\nReplacements (from): Buckland/Cockerill, Morris, Kay, W Johnson/B Deacon, H Tuilagi, Bemand, A Tuiliagi, Lloyd, Vesty.",
    "Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.\nLG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. The firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in January 2004, which gave control to the creditors. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card's plastic for purchases.\nLG Card's creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.\n\"Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,\" said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm's major creditors. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. It says it wants \"fair and reasonable guidelines\" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said. Analysts believe a compromise is likely. \"LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,\" said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.\nLG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. LG card's creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. \"Eventually, LG Group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,\" said Mr Kim.",
    "David McLetchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role.\nThe Scottish Conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with Tods Murray did not influence the causes he supports. But on Friday he said: \"I have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect.\" Mr McLetchie had received advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. Labour said he had \"cleverly\" not asked about paid advocacy. A Tory spokesman \"totally refuted\" any wrongdoing.\nMr McLetchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport. The MSP had been a partner for Tods Murray which has a client opposing the development. Mr McLetchie did not have a complaint made against him, but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong.\nExplaining his reason for quitting the post, Mr McLetchie said: \"I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray. \"However, I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. \"To avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of Tods Murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled, I have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. \"I am proud to have been a part of Tods Murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future.\"\nLabour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was \"very clever\" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. \"He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,\" she said. Section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings \"where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner\". However, MSPs' Code of Conduct \"recognises a wider definition\" of parliamentary proceedings, including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions.\nBut a letter from Holyrood's Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. Commenting on Mr McLetchie's decision to stand down, a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: \"This should mean Mr McLetchie doesn't breach the paid advocacy rules in future. \"However it doesn't change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past.\"\nScottish National Party Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr McLetchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. Ms Sturgeon said: \"I think this whole episode has been very damaging for Mr McLetchie and I'm sure he will be reflecting on it.\" She added that she thought that the Tories were an irrelevant party so she would not \"lose any sleep over it\". Peter Misselbrook, executive partner of Tods Murray said Mr McLetchie had been considering retirement later in the year. He added: \"David has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so.\"",
    "Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.\nFreezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the US, where stocks are low. Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since November. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that it saw no reason to cut its output.\nAlthough below last year's peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004's average of $41.48.\nBrent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close. Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. \"The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it,\" said Chris Furness, senior market strategist at 4Cast. \"If the dollar continues to weaken, oil will be obviously higher.\"\nSeveral Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. \"I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,\" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters. \"I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,\" he added. Opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market. The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year. Heavy stockpiles could help force prices lower when demand eases.",
    "Crude oil prices surged back above the $47 a barrel mark on Thursday after an energy market watchdog raised its forecasts for global demand.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) warned demand for Opec's crude in the first quarter would outstrip supply. The IEA raised its estimate of 2005 oil demand growth by 80,000 barrels a day to 84 million barrels a day. US light crude rose $1.64 to $47.10, while Brent crude in London gained $1.32 to $44.45.\nThe Paris-based IEA watchdog, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from China and other Asian countries. The fresh rally in crude prices followed gains on Wednesday which were triggered by large falls in US crude supplies following a cold spell in North America in January. The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m. On top of that, ongoing problems for beleaguered Russian oil giant Yukos have also prompted the IEA to revise its output estimates from Russia - a major non-Opec supplier. \"I think that prices are now beginning to set a new range and it looks like the $40 to $50 level,\" said energy analyst Orin Middleton of Barclays Capital.",
    "The rewards of leaving front-bench politics are shown in the latest annual register of members' interests.\nThe register shows former Tory leader William Hague earning up to £820,000 on top of his MPs' salary, much of it from speaking fees. His former shadow chancellor Michael Portillo makes up to £560,000 a year - partly because of speeches and TV work. Ex-health secretary Alan Milburn earned up to £85,000 from speeches, articles and advice while not in the Cabinet.\nMr Milburn was away from the frontbench for just more than a year between stepping down as health secretary and becoming Labour's election supremo. His declared interests include £20,000 from newspaper articles and fees of up to £35,000 for four speeches. He also commanded a salary of between £25,000 and £35,000 for being on investment company Bridgepoint Capital's European advisory committee. His time out of office will, however, have lost him his £71,433 minister's salary. Mr Hague's work outside Parliament included two one-man shows, which with other speaking fees netted him up to £480,000. He also earned up to £195,000 for a weekly column in the News of the World, and between £5,000 and £10,000 for presenting BBC'2's Have I Got News for You. Mr Hague was also paid an undisclosed amount for the newspaper serialisation of his biography of William Pitt the Younger and up to £135,00 for work as an adviser to various companies.\nFormer Defence Secretary Michael Portillo makes some of his money as a non-executive director of BAE Systems. He is to stand down as an MP at the next election. And former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was paid between £45,001 and £50,000 for the paperback edition of his book about his resignation from government. His declared income of up to £205,000 also includes payments for being a consultant to the Tote and for his regular column in the Guardian newspaper. The register also shows former Home Office Minister Ann Widdecombe declaring a £100,000 advance for her third and fourth novels. She also received up to £30,000 for acting as the Guardian's agony aunt and between £5,001 and £10,000 for appearing on ITV's Celebrity Fit Club. David Blunkett has become a paid adviser to Indepen Consulting Limited now he is not home secretary - he helps them with seminars about the relationship between government and business. He earns between £5,001and £10,000 for the work.\nTony Blair's entry confirms that King Abdullah of Jordan paid for him to fly from a holiday in Egypt to official discussions - and for a sightseeing tour to Wadi Rum. Tory leader Michael Howard's only fresh entry is a Christmas hamper from the Sultan of Brunei. He also declares a trip to Mexico last year to address executives of News International, and helicopter and private jet travel paid for by supporters. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy registered donations to his office from supporters, a free ticket to last year's Bafta awards and rent from a single-bedroom flat in London. The register only contains new information for December 2004 - but Monday saw the publication of the annual review of the register, with the year's details. The payments are shown in bands of up £5,000, making it difficult to calculate the exact earnings.",
    "Flanker Colin Charvis is unlikely to play any part in Wales' final two games of the Six Nations.\nCharvis has missed all three of Wales' victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected. \"He will not figure in the Scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game,\" said Wales physio Mark Davies. Sonny Parker is continuing to struggle with a neck injury, but Hal Luscombe should be fit for the Murrayfield trip. Centre Parker has only a \"slim chance\" of being involved against the Scots on 13 March, so Luscombe's return to fitness after missing the France match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost.\nSaid Wales assistant coach Scott Johnson: \"We're positive about Hal and hope he'll be raring to go. \"He comes back into the mix again, adds to the depth and gives us other options. \" Replacement hooker Robin McBryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in Paris last Saturday. \"We're getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how Robin's looking,\" added Johnson. \"We're hopeful but it's too early to say at this stage.\" Steve Jones from the Dragons is likely to be drafted in if McBryde fails to recover.",
    "Microsoft has given game makers a glimpse of the new Xbox 2 console.\nSome details of the Xbox's performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual Game Developers Conference in the US. Xbox frontman J. Allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second. Also all titles for the new Xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games.\nMicrosoft is saving the official unveiling of the Xbox 2, codenamed Xenon, for the E3 show in May and the device could be on shop shelves by November. However, during his keynote speech at GDC Mr Allard, who heads development of game-making tools for the console, gave a glimpse into how some of its core software will work. He said gaming was entering a \"high-definition\" era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the HDTV people were starting to watch as well as the HD DVDs that will soon start to appear.\nIndustry watchers took this to mean that the Xbox 2 will push for HDTV quality graphics as standard as well as multi-channel audio to give gamers an authentic experience. Mr Allard said Microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the Xbox 2 and for players to get playing. To this end Microsoft was building in to Xbox hardware systems to support headset chat, buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games. The Xbox would also support well-known industry specifications, such as DirectX, to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console. For gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every Xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware. This interface will hold details of a player's statistics and skill level on a \"gamer card\" as well as give access to a store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons, such as new maps or vehicles, for games they possess. This ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future, said Mr Allard. Only with such consistency would the Xbox be able to support the 10-20 million subscribers that it was aiming for, said Mr Allard. During his speech Mr Allard took several swipes at the Playstation and said processors for consoles had to be made with developers, not just engineers, in mind. \"Our approach is Bruce Lee, not brute force,\" he said.",
    "Shares in online auction house eBay fell 9.8% in after-hours trade on Wednesday, after its quarterly profits failed to meet market expectations.\nDespite seeing net profits rise by 44% to $205.4m (£110m) during October to December, from $142m a year earlier, Wall Street had expected more. EBay stock fell to $92.9 in after-hours trade, from a $103.05 end on Nasdaq. EBay's net revenue for the quarter rose to $935.8m from $648.4m, boosted by growth at its PayPal payment service.\nExcluding special items, eBay's profit was 33 cents a share, but analysts had expected 34 cents.\n\"I think Wall Street has gotten a bit ahead of eBay this quarter and for the 2005 year.\" said Janco Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen. For 2004 as a whole, eBay earned $778.2m on sales of $3.27bn. EBay president and chief executive Meg Whitman called 2004 an \"outstanding success\" that generated \"tremendous momentum\" for 2005. \"I'm more confident than ever that the decisions and investments we're making today will ensure a bright future for the company and our community of users around the world,\" she said. EBay now forecasts 2005 revenue of $4.2bn to $4.35bn and earnings excluding items of $1.48 to $1.52 per share. Analysts had previously estimated that eBay would achieve 2005 revenues of $4.37bn and earnings of $1.62 per share, excluding items.",
    "Brewing giant Inbev has agreed to buy Alfa-Eco's stake in Sun Interbrew, Russia's second-largest brewer, for up to 259.7m euros ($353.3m; £183.75m).\nAlfa-Eco, the venture capital arm of Russian conglomerate Alfa Group, has a one-fifth stake in Sun Interbrew. The deal gives Inbev, the world's biggest beermaker, near-total control over the Russian brewer. Inbev bought out another partner in August 2004. Inbev brands include Bass, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden and Staropramen. It employs 77,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.\nThe Leuven-based brewery said it would own 97.3% of the voting shares and 98.8% of the non-voting shares of Sun Interbrew. The deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. Inbev was formed in August 2004 when Belgium's Interbrew bought Brazilian brewer Ambev. Sun Interbrew, which employs 8,000 staff, owns breweries in eight Russian cities - Klin, Ivanovo, Saransk, Kursk, Volzhsky, Omsk, Perm and Novocheboksarsk. There are also three breweries in Ukraine, in the cities of Chernigov, Nikolaev and Kharkov.",
    "The £10bn Crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get the go-ahead this month, according to The Mail on Sunday.\nIt says the UK Treasury has allocated £7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly. The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast cross-London rail link. The paper says it will go before the House of Commons on 23 February.\nA second reading could follow on 16 or 17 March. \"We've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this remains the case,\" the Department for Transport said on Sunday. Jeremy de Souza, a spokesman for Crossrail, said on Sunday he could not confirm whether the Treasury was planning to invest £7.5bn or when the bill would go before Parliament.\nHowever, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election.\nThe new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of London, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City. Heathrow to the City would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube. The line has the support of the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, business groups and the government, but there have been three years of arguments over how it should be funded. The Mail on Sunday's Financial Mail said the £7.5bn of Treasury money was earmarked for spending in £2.5bn instalments in 2010, 2011 and 2012.",

Get Me Out Of Here as no evictions were made on the television show on Saturday.\nContestants Paul Burrell, Joe Pasquale, Janet Street-Porter and Fran Cosgrave were told by hosts Ant and Dec. Natalie Appleton's decision to quit the show last Monday had given them all a stay of execution, the group were told. Model Sophie Anderton was the last person to be voted off the ITV1 show, set in the Australian jungle. The four remaining stars will do a joint Bushtucker Trial on Sunday.\nFormer All Saints singer Natalie Appleton,31, walked out of the show after learning she would face a fifth so-called Bushtucker Trial. The celebrities are chosen by the viewers to pass trials in order to win food for the rest of the camp.

    "Newcastle have joined the race to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes and scupper Liverpool's bid to snap up the player, according to reports.\nLiverpool were reported to have bid £3.5m for the 28-year-old Spanish international this week. But the Liverpool Echo newspaper has said Anfield boss Rafa Benitez will avoid a bidding war and instead turn his attentions to Nicolas Anelka. Real are believed to still want £7m before selling Morientes. Monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season. Reports suggest Liverpool will lift their offer to £5m - the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal.\nOn Tuesday, Morientes had said: \"I like Liverpool and I am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me. I have told Madrid that I want it to happen. \"Madrid know my situation and they know they must do something about me. They must sort out the situation by being sensible. \"I am in a position where I want to play, and I will have to look elsewhere to do that. If Madrid do not want me then it's in the best interests of everyone that they are realistic.\n\"I haven't spoken to Rafa Benitez but I have always appreciated his work and I would like to play for him. But Benitez could yet turn his attentions to the younger Anelka should Morientes be reluctant to pledge his future to Liverpool. Anelka previously played at Anfield under Gerard Houllier before sealing his permanent switch to Manchester City.",
    "The UK's trade gap narrowed in November, helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the European Union.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the difference between what the UK exported and imported was £3.1bn ($5.8bn), down from October's £3.6bn. Overall UK exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3.2% to £24.8bn, although total imports rose again to a new record of £27.9bn. The deficit for goods alone was £4.6bn, down from October's £5bn. During November the UK exported £16.9bn worth of goods, but imported £21.5bn. The cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at £36.3bn, £4.5bn higher than the same period in 2003.\nNovember saw an improvement in export levels to both the European Union and the rest of the world, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. EU exports rose 2%, fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. Non-EU exports shot up 7.5%, with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars, consumer durables and chemicals. The export boost offset a 1% rise in imports. Non-EU imports rose 3%, but the growth in goods entering the UK from the EU slowed to 0.5%.\nThe UK's deficit with the EU fell to £1.9bn from £2.1bn, while its non-EU shortfall dropped to £2.7bn from £2.9bn in October.\nThe country's surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at £1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. Paul Dales, UK economist for Capital Economics, said the figures represented an improvement on recent months. However, he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain. \"The figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor,\" he said. \"There have been some very encouraging signs that the UK export recovery is starting to take hold. But there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent.\"",
    "Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers, who is accused of overseeing an $11bn (£5.8bn) fraud, never made accounting decisions, a witness has told jurors.\nDavid Myers made the comments under questioning by defence lawyers who have been arguing that Mr Ebbers was not responsible for Worldcom's problems. The phone company collapsed in 2002 and prosecutors claim that losses were hidden to protect the firm's shares. Mr Myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors.\nOn Monday, defence lawyer Reid Weingarten tried to distance his client from the allegations. During cross examination, he asked Mr Myers if he ever knew Mr Ebbers \"make an accounting decision?\". \"Not that I am aware of,\" Mr Myers replied. \"Did you ever know Mr Ebbers to make an accounting entry into Worldcom books?\" Mr Weingarten pressed. \"No,\" replied the witness. Mr Myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former Worldcom chief financial officer Scott Sullivan. Defence lawyers have been trying to paint Mr Sullivan, who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial, as the mastermind behind Worldcom's accounting house of cards.\nMr Ebbers' team, meanwhile, are looking to portray him as an affable boss, who by his own admission is more PE graduate than economist. Whatever his abilities, Mr Ebbers transformed Worldcom from a relative unknown into a $160bn telecoms giant and investor darling of the late 1990s. Worldcom's problems mounted, however, as competition increased and the telecoms boom petered out. When the firm finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Mr Ebbers' trial is expected to last two months and if found guilty the former CEO faces a substantial jail sentence. He has firmly declared his innocence.",
    "David Miliband's rapid rise through the ranks of government continues with his promotion to Cabinet Office minister.\nElected in a safe Labour seat in 2001 his previous job was school standards minister - a role he won in May 2002. Prior to the last election he was a key figure in New Labour as the head of the Downing Street policy unit where he was a key member of the manifesto writing team. Seen as one of the more intellectual figures in the government, he was also working for Tony Blair in his policy unit when he was leader of the opposition.\nA brief glance at Mr Miliband's family background reveals an impressive socialist pedigree in the form of his father Ralph, who died in 1994. He was an eminent and influential leftwing academic. And while David Miliband is seen as a key Blair lieutenant his brother Ed is a special advisor to Chancellor Gordon Brown. Prior to working for Mr Blair, David Miliband spent time at the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. He then became secretary of the Commission on Social Justice. The 39-year-old was educated at Haverstock Comprehensive before going on to Oxford to study politics, philosophy and economics. He also took an MSc in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
    "The US dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on Friday as concern grows about the size of the US budget deficit.\nAnalysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. The Bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. However, trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. This has amplified reactions to news, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in January.\nThe dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on Friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on Thursday. One dollar bought 102.55 yen.\nDisappointing business figures from Chicago triggered the US currency's weakness on Thursday. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2, a bigger fall than expected. \"There are no dollar buyers now, especially after the Chicago data yesterday,\" said ABN Amro's Paul Mackel. At the same time, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was \"absolutely worrying\" for Italian exports. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. Investors will now look towards February's meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised nations in London for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar's decline.",

But it is believed that Glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move. He will still need the approval of major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who own 28.9% of the club to succeed. But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake, while fans remain opposed to his involvement.",

We are top of the league by nine points and in the Carling Cup final. \"The only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the FA Cup. \"In the Champions League all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still Chelsea.\"\nMourinho said it was important to keep his team's results in perspective. \"Don't try to put pressure on me because I am never under pressure,\" he warned. \"We have lost one important game this week - at Newcastle - and we're out of the FA Cup but I don't think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat.

    "India has signed a $40bn (£21bn) deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas from Iran.\nFirms led by the Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will also assist in the development of Iranian oil fields. Ministers, eager to gain access to energy supplies to meet the demands of a booming economy, secured a similar deal to one between Iran and China. The announcement comes as ONGC said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled Russian oil firm Yukos. The agreements with Iran were sealed after talks in New Delhi between Middle East producers and Asia's biggest energy consumers - China, India, Japan and South Korea.\nIran - Opec's second-biggest oil producer and one of the world's top gas producers - has been pursuing a series of deals, rewarding LNG buyers with participation in development of its oil fields. Under the agreement, it will supply India with 7.5 million tonnes of LPG annually over a 25 year period from 2009. ONGC and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) reached a preliminary deal for Indian firms to take part in the development of the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, both countries said in a statement. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. Consumption has jumped to 2.4 million barrels per day, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.",
    "An ex-chief financial officer at Boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $250,000 (£131,961) for illegally hiring a top Air Force aide.\nMichael Sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting Darleen Druyun while she still handled military contracts. Ms Druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. Boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a Pentagon inquiry into the case. The contract, to provide refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, was cancelled last year.\nThe Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by Ms Druyun's role in the procurement process. Boeing sacked Mr Sears and Ms Druyun in November 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. Ms Druyun had talks with Mr Sears in October 2002 about working for Boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the Pentagon. She subsequently joined the company in January 2003. Ms Druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to Boeing and other favoured companies.\nIn documents filed in a Virginia court ahead of Mr Sears' sentencing, prosecutors blamed Boeing's senior management for failing to ask key questions about the \"legal and ethical issues\" surrounding Ms Druyun's appointment. Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with Boeing. However, analysts believe Boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. The Pentagon has investigated 400 contracts, dating back to 1993, since the allegations against Ms Druyun came to light.\nBoeing's corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. Boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. The Pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to Boeing and prohibited the Seattle-based company from future rocket work.",
    "Kraft plans to cut back on advertising of products like Oreo cookies and sugary Kool-Aid drinks as part of an effort to promote healthy eating.\nThe largest US food maker will also add a label to its more nutritional and low-fat brands to promote the benefits. Kraft rival PepsiCo began a similar labelling initiative last year. The moves come as the firms face criticism from consumer groups concerned at rising levels of obesity in US children. Major food manufacturers have recently been reformulating the content of some calorie-heavy products.\nKraft's new advertising policy, which covers advertising on TV, radio and in print publications, is aimed at children between the ages of six and 11. It means commercials for some of its most famous snacks and cereals shown during early morning cartoon shows on TV will now be replaced by food and drink qualifying for Kraft's new \"Sensible Solution\" label. But the firm said it would continue to advertise all its products in media seen by parents and \"all family\" audiences. \"We're working on ways to encourage both adults and children to eat wisely by selecting more nutritionally balanced diets,\" said Lance Friedmann, Kraft senior vice president.",
    "The Tories say ministers must respond in Parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the Iraq war was drawn up at Number 10.\nDowning Street has denied the claims, made in a new book about the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's advice. Lord Goldsmith also denied them, saying he was not \"leaned on\" in any way. But the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.\nThe government has consistently refused to publish Lord Goldsmith's advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.\nBut a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. It said it was \"plain\" Iraq continued to be in material breach of UN resolution 1441. In his new book, Lawless World, Philippe Sands, a QC and international law professor, suggests the parliamentary answer was written in Downing Street. According to Mr Sands, Lord Goldsmith had warned Tony Blair in a document on 7 March 2003 that the use of force against Iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.\nMr Sands told Newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case, in case legal action was taken against the UK over the war. On 10 March, military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. The book, being serialised in the Guardian newspaper, says on 13 March Lord Goldsmith met then Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan. \"After that Downing Street proceeded to set out his [Lord Goldsmith's] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 March,\" said Mr Sands.\nTory leader Michael Howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General, warning: \"This issue will not go away.\" \"These revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates - even on an issue as important as peace and war. \"The government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust.\" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell repeated his party's calls for Lord Goldsmith's first piece of legal advice to be made public. \"The public interest, which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice, can only be served now by the fullest disclosure.\"\nIn a statement to Newsnight, Lord Goldsmith said: \"In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions. \"It was certainly not a view that I expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way, nor as I have already made clear, was it written by or at Number 10.\" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected the claims, saying: \"The attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his.\" But ex-foreign secretary Robin Cook says all the advice should now be published. He said the claims suggested Parliament had only received a pr&#233;cis of Lord Goldsmith's second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in No 10. This would be wrong even if Lord Goldsmith had signed the statement, Mr Cook said, because the attorney general's advice should be an \"independent legal opinion\", not subject to \"political negotiation of this kind\".",
    "Deutsche Boerse bosses have held \"constructive, professional and friendly\" talks with the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its chief has said.\nWerner Seifert met LSE chief executive Clara Furse amid rumours the German group may raise its bid to £1.5bn ($2.9bn) from its initial £1.3bn offer. However, rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. The Paris-based exchange, owner of Liffe in London, is reported to be ready to raise £1.4bn to fund a bid.\nThe news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE since its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London exchange for undervaluing the business. However, the LSE did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \"significantly-improved proposal\" would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. However, neither side has made a formal offer for the LSE, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away.\nDeutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. Among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by Mr Seifert with Ms Furse were plans to move the management of its cash and Eurex derivatives market to London, as well as two members of its executive board. But, Hans Reckers, a board member of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt, something Deutsche Boerse could move to the UK. \"It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt. This has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants,\" he said. Local government officials in Frankfurt's state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move. \"It is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain Frankfurt's standing as the number one financial centre in continental Europe,\" Alois Rhiel, its minister for economic affairs added.",
    "Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm Guidant for $25.4bn (£13bn).\nGuidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. Analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting Johnson & Johnson's reliance on a slowing drug business. They also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. A number of Johnson & Johnson's products are facing patent expirations, while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. Meanwhile, demand for defibrillators, which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected, is expected to increase, analysts said. The move by Johnson & Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each Guidant share, 6% more than Wednesday's closing price. Analysts say that US antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. Stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.",
    "Interactive posters are helping Londoners get around the city during the festive season.\nWhen interrogated with a mobile phone, the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home. Sited at busy underground stations, the posters are fitted with an infra-red port that can beam information directly to a handset. The posters are part of Transport for London's Safe Travel at Night campaign.\nThe campaign is intended to help Londoners, especially women, avoid trouble on the way home. In particular it aims to cut the number of sexual assaults by drivers of unlicensed minicabs. Nigel Marson, head of group marketing at Transport for London (TfL), said the posters were useful because they work outside the mobile phone networks. \"They can work in previously inaccessible areas such as underground stations which is obviously a huge advantage in a campaign of this sort,\" he said.\nThe posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an IR port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster. \"We started with infra-red because there are a huge number IR phones out there,\" said Rachel Harker, spokeswoman for Hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters. \"It's a well established technology.\" Hypertag is also now making a poster that uses short-range Bluetooth radio technology to swap data. Although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number, Ms Harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images, ring tones and video clips. She said that there are no figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign run for a cosmetics firm racked up 12,500 interactions. \"Before we ran a campaign there was a big question mark of: 'If we build it will they come?'\" she said. \"Now we know that, yes, they will.\" The TfL campaign using the posters will run until Boxing Day.",
    "A study of the United States at war in the past 50 years has picked up one of the main awards at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival in Utah, in the US.\nWhy We Fight scooped the grand jury prize for documentaries at the world's leading independent film festival. British director Sean McAllister's The Liberace of Baghdad - about a pianist in war-torn Iraq - won a special prize in the world documentary category. Both Why We Fight and The Liberace of Baghdad were made for the BBC. Why We Fight is due to be screened on BBC Four in March.\nThe Sundance festival was founded by actor Robert Redford in 1981. This year's festival - which ended on Sunday after a 11-day run - has been dominated by the themes of war and politics. In the new world cinema drama category, the Angolan film The Hero triumphed to win the grand jury prize. The film - an Angolan/French/Portuguese production - tells the story of a veteran of the country's civil war who returns home to face a new battle of survival. Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focused on countries and people under siege.\nFinnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya and Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire tells the story of a UN mission to Rwanda during the 1994 genocide. But it was Dutch documentary Shape of the Moon - a study of an extended family in Indonesia - which took the top prize. Meanwhile, French-Israeli production Wall, which looks at Israel's controversial security wall separating it from the Palestinian territories, picked up a world cinema special jury prize for documentaries. In the main drama category, Forty Shades of Blue was named winner of the grand jury prize. The film tells the tale of a forbidden tug-of-love between a father, his Russian immigrant girlfriend and his son.\nDuring its 24-year history, the Sundance Film Festival has showcased successes such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project and The Full Monty. Last year's festival provided a platform for hits such as Open Water, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and Super-Size Me. The festival is held in the mountain resort of Park City, east of Salt Lake City, which sees its population rise from 7,500 to 45,000 during the festival.",
    "Now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for TV is being prepared for our sets.\nIn most corners of TV and technology industries, high-definition (HDTV) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour. HD essentially makes TV picture quality at least four times better than now. But there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about HD on the High Street. Thousands of flat panel screens - LCDs (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV sets - have already been sold as \"HD\", but are in fact not able to display HD.\n\"The UK is the largest display market in Europe,\" according to John Binks, director of GfK, which monitors global consumer markets.\nBut, he added: \"Of all the flat panel screens sold, just 1.3% in the UK are capable of getting high-definition.\" There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra. They may be fantastic quality TVs, but many do not have adaptors in them - called DVI or HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. Part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the High Street, say industry experts, who gathered at Bafta in London for the 2nd European HDTV Summit last week. \"We have to be careful about consumer confusion. There is a massive education process to go through,\" said Mr Binks. The industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it. Eventually, that will be everyone. The BBC is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010.\nPreparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas, and programmes are being filmed with HD cameras. BSkyB plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes, to receive HDTV broadcasts, in time for Christmas. Like its Sky+ boxes, they will also be personal video recorders (PVRs). The company will start broadcasts of HDTV programmes, offering them as \"premium channel packages\", concentrating, to start with, on sports, big events, and films, in early 2006. But the set-top box which receives HDTV broadcasts has to plug into a display - TV set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that HD demands, if HDTV is to be \"real\". By 2010, 20% of homes in the UK will have some sort of TV set or display that can show HD in its full glory.\nBut it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to \"being digital\". As a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a HD forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other. Part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection. But it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for.\nFrom next month, all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a \"HD-Ready\" sticker. This also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. \"The logo is absolutely the way forward,\" said David Mercer, analysts with Strategy Analytics. \"But it is still not appearing on many retail products.\" The industry is upbeat that the sticker will help, but it is only a start. \"We can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers,\" said Mr Oudendijk. \"There may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months.\" The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is testing different flavours of HD formats to prepare for even better HDTV further down the line. It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, as well as which devices will support the formats. \"We believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile,\" said Phil Laven, technical director for the EBU. The TV display manufacturers want us to watch HD on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the \"true impact\" of HD, they say, although smaller displays suffice. What may convince people to spend money on HD-ready devices is the falling prices, which continue to tumble across Europe. The prices are dropping an average of 20% every year, according to analysts. LCD prices dropped by 43% in Europe as a whole last year, according to Mr Oudendijk.",
    "Sir Joshua Reynolds' Portrait of Omai will get a public airing following fears it would stay hidden because of an export wrangle.\nThe Tate Gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the UK. The 18th Century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition. The exhibition of Reynolds' work will be shown at Tate Britain from May. Joshua Reynolds: The Creation of Celebrity will feature prints, caricatures, and sculpture by the 18th Century artist, who painted some of the most famous personalities of his day. Portrait of Omai fetched the second highest amount for a British painting when it was sold at auction for £10.3m in 2001. It was bought by a London dealer who sold it on to a collector. The unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country, but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance.\nIn March 2004, the Tate managed to raise £12.5m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since. The portrait is of a young man who was dubbed \"the noble savage\" when he arrived in London from Polynesia. He became a darling of London society and was invited to all the best parties by people who were fascinated by such an exotic character. Sir Joshua painted him after his arrival in 1774, and it became the artist's most famous work after it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1776.",
    "Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.\nJohn Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be \"made available to law-abiding members of the community\" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The document reportedly said: \"We're looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. \"The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do.\" Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate. He told BBC News: \"He appears to have said these things. We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. \"By all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. \"It is simply a distraction from the task in hand, the EU constitution, not individual idiocies.\" Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: \"I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway.\"\nPeter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night. \"He will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.\" He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party. He added: \"I can't comment too much at the moment, I have one version from him but I haven't seen the papers yet.\"",
    "Celtic brushed aside Clyde to secure their place in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half.\nThe home side's Craig Bryson had a goal chopped off before Stan Varga headed Celtic into the lead. Alan Thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Shaun Maloney had been fouled. Stilian Petrov slid in a third, Varga tapped in his second and Craig Bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. Bryn Halliwell was the busier keeper early on, saving from Bellamy, Chris Sutton and Juninho. Clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from Bryson, but the referee had already blown for a foul by Petrov. From the resulting free kick, Darren Sheridan curled the ball round the Celtic wall only for the post to deny him. Back at the other end, Halliwell did well to come off his line and block Bellamy's effort to lift the ball over him. The keeper misjudged a corner that Stephane Henchoz headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. The ball was delivered from the left and Halliwell was left floundering as Varga glanced the ball into the net.\nMaloney replaced the injured Sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. The young striker fired a free kick straight into the Clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by Bryson and Thompson converted the penalty. Sheridan and Bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. Juninho brought out another good save from Halliwell and then Petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. But Petrov and Juninho combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past Halliwell from 12 yards. Varga got his second goal of the game as Celtic drove home their advantage - Thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and Bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving Aiden McGeady, Jackie McNamara and Maloney culminated in the Welshman hammering the ball into the net. Halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a McGeady shot wide as the game petered out.\nHalliwell, Mensing, Bollan, Balmer, Potter, Sheridan (Burns 61), Arbuckle (Gilhaney 61), Gibson, Bryson (Jones 78), Malone, Harty.\nMorrison, Wilson.\nMensing, Sheridan.\nDouglas, Henchoz, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Juninho Paulista, Thompson, Lennon (Lambert 70), Sutton (Maloney 45), Petrov (McGeady 70), Bellamy.\nMarshall, Laursen.\nThompson, Bellamy.\n: Varga 40, Thompson 48 pen, Petrov 60, Varga 68, Bellamy 72.\n8,200\nC Thomson",
    "Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby beat Martin Scorsese's The Aviator to the top awards at the Oscars on Sunday.\nThe boxing drama was named best picture and Eastwood pipped Scorsese to best director, while its stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won acting awards. The Aviator took five prizes including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett. The biopic of Howard Hughes led the nominations with 11. Jamie Foxx picked up best actor for playing soul star Ray Charles in Ray. Many expected this to be Scorsese's year - but he was unsuccessful in the best director category for the fifth time in his career.\nHe has never won despite being nominated for such films as Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Instead, Eastwood took his second Oscar for best director after winning for Unforgiven in 1993. \"It was a wonderful adventure,\" Eastwood said. \"To make a picture in 37 days, it takes a well oiled machine. I am lucky to be here and lucky to be still working. I've got a lot of stuff to do yet.\" Hilary Swank picked up her second best actress Oscar for playing a female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, beating stars including Annette Bening, Kate Winslet and Imelda Staunton. \"I don't know what I did in this life to deserve this,\" she told the audience. \"I'm just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream.\" Morgan Freeman beat actors including Clive Owen, Jamie Foxx and Alan Alda to the prize for best supporting actor. He thanked Eastwood and described the film as \"a labour of love\". This was the fourth nomination of his career but his first win. Backstage, he said: \"A lot of people say you're due - maybe you are, maybe you aren't - it's an accolade.\" Million Dollar Baby's success was the night's biggest surprise after The Aviator seemed to have the advantage until the end of the ceremony.\nCate Blanchett, who won for playing late screen legend Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, said her award was \"an indescribable surprise and honour\". Of Hepburn, she said: \"The longevity of her career is inspiring to everyone.\" Blanchett also paid tribute to the film's director Martin Scorsese, telling him: \"I hope my son will marry your daughter.\" The Aviator's other awards came for cinematography, film editing, art direction and costume design. And Jamie Foxx, who had two nominations this year, paid tribute to the \"beautiful legacy\" of soul legend Ray Charles, who died last year, and thanked director Taylor Hackford. \"You took a chance, man,\" he said. \"That love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. \"Everybody's drowning in this love. Thank you for taking a chance and thank you for waiting 15 years to get me to do it.\"\nHe broke down in tears when speaking about being whipped by his grandmother, whom he described as his first acting teacher, when he was young. In other awards, cartoon hit The Incredibles won best animated feature and best sound editing. Bittersweet comedy Sideways won best adapted screenplay while the original screenplay prize went to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Born into Brothels, about the children of prostitutes in Calcutta, was named best documentary, The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film and Finding Neverland got the accolade for best musical score. Spider-Man 2 triumphed in the visual effects category, Ray won best sound mixing and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events picked up best make-up. Former British TV presenter Andrea Arnold, who hosted children's shows Motormouth and Number 73 in the 1980s, won best short film for Wasp. Comedian Chris Rock, who hosted the ceremony for the first time, received a standing ovation before getting the show under way.",
    "Sri Lanka's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.\nPresident Kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from Sri Lanka's economic growth this year. It estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5% of the economy.\nSeparately, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in Sri Lanka and Indonesia alone. It called for action to create jobs. President Kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of Hambantota. She was joined by government and opposition politicians, together with Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian clergy.\nPrime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6,000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. Mrs Kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be \"the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation\". \"We are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. Instead we have been squabbling, fighting,\" she added. Norway's peace negotiator Erik Solheim is due to arrive on Wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the Tamil Tigers, who want a separate state in the north east of the country. Reconstruction efforts in eastern Sri Lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.\nThe IMF said that the Sri Lankan authorities' initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn, but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this. \"The broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage,\" the IMF said. Growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs. \"The fishing industry has been devastated, agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer, especially in the short term,\" the report said. The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries. Earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. Economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast. Inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. Although major exports have not suffered, the IMF expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves may become strained as \"Sri Lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level\" which totalled more than two months worth of imports. Last week, the IMF approved Sri Lanka's request for a freeze on loan repayments.",
    "Carlos Moya became the first man to successfully defend the Chennai Open title by beating four-times finalist Paradorn Srichaphan 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7/5).\nThe Spaniard then donated his £28,000 prize money to relief efforts for the victims of the Asian tsunami. The final was close throughout, with Thai second seed Srichaphan - the 2003 winner - closing out the first set. But Moya took the second set, before bouncing back from 5-2 down in the decider to force and win a tie-break. Moya confirmed afterwards: \"I'm donating my prize money from this tournament for the tsunami victims, hoping it makes some difference to their lives. His contribution follows pledges by four other players to donate their prize money from the tournament, which went ahead after the 26 December disaster which has so far claimed at least 150,000 lives. Scrichapan said he would donate an unspecified amount for relief work in Thailand, where more than 5,000 people were killed. The ATP has announced that it would contribute the US$25,000 tournament fee to Unicef's emergency relief fund in Tamil Nadu. The ATP Tour's sponsor, Mercedes, said it would also contribute, increasing the ATP donation to US$40,000.",
    "A mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful.\nThe specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video. Currently, rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. The technology, OMAP-Vox, is being tested by firms in Europe and Asia and could appear by the end of the year. Texas, which makes computer chips for more than half the world's mobile phones, said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable. \"We're going to drive them down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share,\" said Doug Rasor, a marketing vice president at Texas. The chip also uses much less power than conventional chips, said Texas, which means less strain on mobile battery life.\nMore than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK, but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. Texas is keen to cash in on the third generation (3G) of mobile technology, which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. But it faces stiff competition from the likes of Intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles.\nCompetition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK's operators have now launched third generation networks. A recent survey by Sony Ericsson predicted that the number of 3G handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold. Many consumers are still to be convinced though. A further recent survey said that only 4% of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3G phones. Many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard.\nBut there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. Earlier in January, NTT DoCoMo and Vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks, known as \"super 3G\", intended to be 10 times faster than 3G services. The first stage of development is to be completed by 2007, but no date has been set for a commercial launch The newly-designed OMAP-Vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference, 3GSM, which takes place in Cannes, France this week.",
    "Net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites\nInternet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail. Lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out. The net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool, spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data.\n\"We've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do,\" said Malte Pollmann, spokesman for Lycos Europe. \"In the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users,\" he said, \"but now we are going to go one step further.\"\n\"We've found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers.\" By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver, Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity. Mr Pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with. He said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web. \"Every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day,\" he said, \"about one MP3 file.\" But, he said, if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. Lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back, said Mr Pollmann. \"That would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing,\" he said.\nThe sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer.\nTypically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e-mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day. The list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as Spamcop. To limit the chance of mistakes being made, Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods. As these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said Mr Pollmann. Sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. Early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85%. Users do not have to be registered users of Lycos to download and use the screensaver. While working, the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data. The screensaver is due to be launched across Europe on 1 December and before now has only been trialled in Sweden. Despite the soft launch, Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days. \"There's a huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more,\" he said \"Before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive.\"",
    "The International Rugby Board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.\nIt may have to go the whole way and have NFL-style video cameras all over the field, or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. What the IRB does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. Sunday's explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road was a good example as Ireland took another step towards their first Grand Slam since 1948. The game was as exciting as it comes, with a much-improved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. One can understand that frustration. There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory, but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sport's \"blazers\". Referee Jonathan Kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. I doubt whether Kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. After all, he has no public recourse to criticism.\nIt was the same for Simon McDowell, the touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France. As far as England were concerned, there were queries over Mark Cueto's first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a Charlie Hodgson kick.\nEngland coach Andy Robinson referred to a similar case at Ravenhill in January when Ulster were playing Gloucester in the Heineken Cup. On that occasion, David Humphreys kicked to Tommy Bowe, who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. But you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. Perhaps Robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey was driven over the Irish line near the end.\nLewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. However, one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. But in rugby, everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. The referee also missed England's Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan O'Gara off the ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to the line. Those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes.\nBut there were many more, and one should not take away from those. Brian O'Driscoll's winning try was as well-conceived as they come, while Charlie Hodgson's brilliant kicking display was another highlight. And Ronan O'Gara's tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. But the defining moments came with Ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on. The first was Denis Hickie's brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. He gobbled up Cueto from another Hodgson cross-field kick, then regained his feet to stop Lewsey from scoring a certain try. Ireland's second-row colossus Paul O'Connell was equally superb. England had turned Ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. England prop Matt Stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. Unfortunately he ran into O'Connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. That spoke volumes about Ireland's back-foot display, with defensive coach Mike Ford taking a bow at the end. To win a game like that showed that Ireland have moved forward. It may be tries that win games, but it is defence that wins championships.",
    "General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.\nThe car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.\nGM's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. But the group's new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM's cuts.\nNeither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment's leaders do not agree.\nGM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.\nBringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. \"We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,\" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was \"stupid\", he said.\nIn a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change \"customers' perceptions\" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.",
    "Internet TV has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now.\nBut any early attempts to do it - the UK's Home Choice started in 1992 - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network. Now that broadband networks are bedding down, and it is becoming essential for millions, the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line. In the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls, they are keen to be the top IPTV dogs. Software giant Microsoft thinks IPTV - Internet Protocol TV - is the future of television, and it sits neatly with its vision of the \"connected entertainment experience\". \"Telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time,\" Ed Graczyk, director of marketing for Microsoft IPTV, told the BBC News website. \"The challenge has been the broadband network, and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution. \"Compression technology was not efficient enough, the net was not good enough. A lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality.\"\nLast year, he said, was all about deal making and partnering up; shaping the \"IPTV ecosystem\". This year, those deals will start to play out and more services will come online. \"2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in South America, and other parts of Asia, it will expand,\" he added. What telcos really want to do is to send the \"triple-play\" of video, voice, and data down one single line, be it cable or DSL (Digital Subscriber Line). Some are talking about \"quadruple play\", too, with mobile services added into the mix. It is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators. According to technology analysts, TDG Research, there will be 20 million subscribers to IPTV services in under six years.\nKey to the appeal of sending TV programmes down the same line as the web data, whenever a viewer wants it, is that it uses the same technology as the internet. It means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the \"broadcaster\". This allows for more DVD-like interactivity, limitless storage and broadcast space, bespoke channel \"playlists\", and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer's fingertips. It potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller, niche or localised audiences, sending films to Bollywood fans for instance, as well as individual devices.\nOperators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer, bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver. Perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking. Currently, there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite, cable or Freeview. With IPTV, the speed is 15 milliseconds. \"That gets rounds of applause,\" according to Mr Graczyk. Microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about IPTV some time ago. \"We believe this will be the way all TV is delivered in the future - but that is several years away,\" said Mr Graczyk. \"As with music, TV has moved to digital formats. \"The things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the TV, to the mobile, to the gaming console and so on.\" The company intends its Microsoft's IPTV Edition software, an end-to-end management and delivery platform, to let telcos to do exactly that, seamlessly. It has netted seven major telcos as customers, representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers. Its deal with US telco SBC was the largest TV software deal to date, said Mr Graczyk.\nIPTV is about more than telcos, though. There are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net's power. Jeremy Allaire, chief of Brightcove, told the BBC News website that it would be a flavour of IPTV that was about harnessing the web as a \"channel\".\n\"It is not just niches, but about exploiting content not usually viewed,\" he said. \"We are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content, and who often see unencumbered distribution. \"For them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive,\" he said. This type of IPTV service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives, for instance. What is a clear sign that IPTV has a future is that Microsoft is not the only player in the field. There are a lot of other \"middleware\" players providing similar management services as Microsoft, like Myrio and C-Cor. But it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful.",
    "Larne's teenage star Robbie Weir is poised to join Sunderland after turning down a move to Stoke City.\nThe 17-year-old Irish League midfielder was also being chased by Rangers and Fulham, but Mick McCarthy's side appear to have won the race. But Larne boss Jimmy McGeough has yet to confirm that Weir is on his way from Inver Park. \"I heard on Sunday that he has joined Sunderland, but not from the lad himself,\" he said. ''Robbie has an agreement with Larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs.\n''Personally, I would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the full-time game. ''He has been on trial with a number of clubs. But it would be great to see him making it at Sunderland.''",
    "Conservative leader Michael Howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall.\nMr Howard said his time at Jack's Snooker Hall in Llanelli in the 1950s had not done him \"any lasting damage\". But he told the Times Educational Supplement that truancy was \"very bad\" and said \"firm action\" was needed. Mr Howard also called for a return to O-levels and more classroom discipline.\nMr Howard eventually left Llanelli Grammar School - and the snooker hall - to go to Cambridge University. He said: \"I don't think it's done me any lasting damage. Nor has it made me a snooker world champion. \"There might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon.\n\"I'm just being honest. I think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it.\" Another player who has failed to win snooker's world championship - Jimmy \"the Whirlwind \" White - has previously admitted missing lessons, instead spending his days in smoky halls. \"Tony Meo [another player] and me used to spend all of our spare time there,\" Mr White said, \"We loved the game and the atmosphere. \"School went out of the window. I went for a while and then started taking time off.\" Mr Howard's fellow Welshman Ray Reardon - known by his fellow professionals as \"Dracula\" - won the snooker world championship six times, having left school at 14 to work as a miner. And Terry Griffiths, like Mr Howard from Llanelli, won the tournament in 1979. It is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at Jack's.",
    "Maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.\nIt would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.",
    "Labour MPs have angrily criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men.\nA meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise Labour's election hopes. The PM insisted nothing would derail Labour's campaign, despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside. Mr Brown will again be in the public eye at the party's new poster launch. In what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity, he is due to line up alongside Alan Milburn - the man controversially appointed as the party's election supremo - and deputy leader John Prescott for the event in London on Tuesday. Relations between Mr Brown and Mr Milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since Mr Blair brought the latter back into the Cabinet to run Labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by Mr Brown in both 1997 and 2001.\nMr Blair told the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\"\nThe prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the PLP and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. New speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in Brown's Britain, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, which suggested Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown. Labour's Paul Flynn said Mr Blair and Mr Brown had a \"scorching\" from MPs adding: \"It was a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting like no other.\"\nBackbencher Stephen Pound said some MPs had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if Mr Blair and Mr Brown did not \"stop this nonsense, this poisonous briefing\". Lord Campbell-Savours, a former MP, challenged Mr Brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said. Mr Prescott said MPs were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports.\n\"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today on Tuesday. Mr Prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government. But he argued Mr Blair and Mr Brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services.\nThe new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. He had then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from Cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked. Mr Blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while Mr Brown says he will not let \"gossip\" distract him from helping a unified election campaign. The Conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the Liberal Democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government.",
    "Yukos will return to a US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.\nYukos has said it will sue Baikal and others involved in the sale of Yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to have Baikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored a US court order last week blocking the sale. Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear.\nRussian newspapers have claimed that Baikal - which bought the Yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) on Sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with Surgutneftegas, Russia's fourth-biggest oil producer. Many observers believe that the unit, which produces 60% of Yukos' oil output, could ultimately fall into the hands of Surgutneftegas or even Gazprom, the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.\nThe Russian government forced the sale of Yukos' most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. Yukos' US lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of US bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. On Wednesday, Yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group. \"We believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us,\" Yukos spokesman Mike Lake told Agence France Press. \"If it exports that oil, it will be marketing a stolen product,\" he added. The future ownership of Yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that Baikal was established as a front for other interests.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, President Putin said Baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other Russian energy firms interested in the development of Yuganskneftegas. President Putin also suggested that China's National Petroleum Corporation could play a role in the unit's future after signing a commercial agreement with Gazprom to work on joint energy projects. Yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company. Commentators and Yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a government campaign to destroy it because of the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.",
    "Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.\nThe Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be \"limited\". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and \"add-ons\" that the software giant offers.\nPeople who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.\nMicrosoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. \"It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,\" he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. \"China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,\" said Mr Cluley.",
    "The classic film It's A Wonderful Life is to be turned into a musical by the producer of the controversial hit show Jerry Springer - The Opera.\nFrank Capra's 1946 movie starring James Stewart, is being turned into a £7m musical by producer Jon Thoday. He is working with Steve Brown, who wrote the award-winning musical Spend Spend Spend. A spokeswoman said the plans were in the \"very early stages\", with no cast, opening date or theatre announced.\nA series of workshops have been held in London, and on Wednesday a cast of singers unveiled the musical to a select group of potential investors. Mr Thoday said the idea of turning the film into a musical had been an ambition of his for almost 20 years. It's a Wonderful Life was based on a short story, The Greatest Gift, by Philip van Doren Stern. Mr Thoday managed to buy the rights to the story from Van Doren Stern's family in 1999, following Mr Brown's success with Spend Spend Spend. He later secured the film rights from Paramount, enabling them to use the title It's A Wonderful Life.",
    "Japanese electronics firm Hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called Emiew, to challenge Honda's Asimo and Sony's Qrio robots.\nHitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) Emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet. Two wheel-based Emiews, Pal and Chum, introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in Japan. The robots will be guests at the World Expo later this month. Sony and Honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics. Explaining why Hitachi's Emiew used wheels instead of feet, Toshihiko Horiuchi, from Hitachi's Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, said: \"We aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people.\" \"We want to make the robots useful for people ... If the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated.\" Emiew - Excellent Mobility and Interactive Existence as Workmate - can move at 3.7m/h. Its \"wheel feet\" resemble the bottom half of a Segway scooter. With sensors on the head, waist, and near the wheels, Pal and Chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. \"I want to be able to walk about in places like Shinjuku and Shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars,\" Pal told reporters. Hitachi said Pal and Chum, which have a vocabulary of about 100 words, could be \"trained\" for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years.\nRobotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. At the recent AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) annual meeting in Washington DC, researchers showed off bipedal designs. The three designs, each built by a different research group, use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait.\nSony and Honda have both used humanoid robots, which are not commercially available, as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. Honda's Asimo was \"born\" five years ago. Since then, Honda and Sony's Qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. Asimo, has visited the UK, Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Ireland as part of a world tour. Sony's Qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs. But its record was beaten by Asimo. It is capable of 3km/h, which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as Qrio. Last year, car maker Toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. By 2007, it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million \"entertainment and leisure\" robots in homes, compared to about 137,000 currently, according to the United Nations (UN). By the end of that year, 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes, said the report by the UN Economic Commission for Europe and the International Federation of Robotics. Hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market.",
    "The US budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (£197bn) this year, officials said on Tuesday.\nThe cost of military operations still needs to be factored in, with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red. Past Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. In recent months, the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. In November, the gap between US exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure. The CBO says it envisages a further \"orderly\" decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. But the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost US economic growth.\nThe budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 September 2004, after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year. The CBO also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections. However, analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president's plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. The figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. Republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 September attacks and ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of President George W Bush's election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. But Democrats have accused the president of excluding Iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit, a charge which the administration denies. On Tuesday, the US administration asked Congress for additional funds for military operations.",

A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said there were no plans to sell the channel.\nHe added that primary legislation would be required for the station to be sold off, which the government was not intending to introduce. Brookside was axed in 2003 after its ratings slumped from a peak of seven million to just 1.5 million.

    "Venezuelan authorities have identified more than 500 farms, including 56 large estates, as idle as it continues with its controversial land reform policy.\nUnder a 2001 land law, the government can tax or seize unused farm sites. A further 40,000 farms are yet to be inspected, the state's National Land Institute has told Associated Press. Vice president Jose Vicente Rangel has said farmers and ranchers with their titles in order and their lands productive have \"nothing to fear.\" Critics of the land reform policy claim president Hugo Chavez is trying to enforce a communist-style economic programme that ignores property rights and will damage the country. Land owners claim the National Land Institute has made mistakes in classifying lands as public or private.\nBut the government - Venezuela's largest land owner - say they are proceeding cautiously to prevent conflicts. In a statement, Mr Rangel said the land reform is not against the constitution, which permits private property, while stressing the efforts are to \"vindicate social and economically\" years of inequality in the country.\nOne property in conflict with the government is the El Charcote cattle ranch, run by Agroflora, a subsidiary of the UK food group Vestey. Agriculture minister Arnoldo Marquez told Reuters news agency the site's documents \"do not guarantee that this is a private land\". Administrators of the ranch, however, have complained that pro-Chavez squatters have taken over 80% of the property in the last four years, and the UK government has asked Venezuelan authorities to resolve the conflict. \"You should ask the company when they are going to put their papers in order and hand over the land that is not theirs,\" said Mr Marquez.",

Critics of the takeover have complained that the money could be better used by returning cash to shareholders. Deutsche Boerse also said profit in the three months to 31 December was 120.7m euros ($158.8m; £83.3m).

    "Asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the Asian tsunami and floods.\nWorld Bank president James Wolfensohn has said his agency is \"only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster\" and its economic impact. The tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit. Some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. Millions have been left homeless, while businesses and infrastructure have been washed away.\nEconomists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.\nIn Sri Lanka, some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. For Thailand, that figure is much lower at 0.1%. Governments are expected to take steps, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending, to facilitate a recovery.\n\"With the enormous displacement of people...there will be a serious relaxation of fiscal policy,\" Glenn Maguire, chief economist for the region at Societe Generale, told Agence France Presse. \"The economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005,\" he said. \"First and foremost this is a human tragedy.\" India's economy, however, is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. The regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004. But India now faces other problems, with aid workers under pressure to ensure a clean supply of water and sanitation to prevent an outbreak of disease.\nThailand's Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). Analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country's tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit. Thailand's fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by Sunday's 9.0 magnitude earthquake, which sent huge waves from Malaysia to Africa. Malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be \"significant\", Agence France Presse reported. Rapid rebuilding will be key to limiting the impact of the tragedy. \"In three months, we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces,\" said Juthamas Siriwan, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. The outlook for Sri Lanka is less optimistic, with analysts predicting that the country's tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly. Tourism is a vital to many developing countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).",
    "Ocean's Twelve, the crime caper sequel starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, has gone straight to number one in the US box office chart.\nIt took $40.8m (£21m) in weekend ticket sales, according to studio estimates. The sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across Europe. It knocked last week's number one, National Treasure, into third place. Wesley Snipes' Blade: Trinity was in second, taking $16.1m (£8.4m). Rounding out the top five was animated fable The Polar Express, starring Tom Hanks, and festive comedy Christmas with the Kranks.\nOcean's Twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a December release in the US, after the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean's Eleven which took $38.1m (£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (£95.8m) in total. A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean's Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh. Soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites Clooney, Pitt and Roberts with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the all-star cast. \"It's just a fun, good holiday movie,\" said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Bros. However, US critics were less complimentary about the $110m (£57.2m) project, with the Los Angeles Times labelling it a \"dispiriting vanity project\".

The division was tasked with improving US defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats. Reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation.\nMr Yoran took up his post in September 2003 and his first task was to get the Cyber Security Division up and running. The organisation had a staff of about 60 people and a budget of about $80m (£44.54m). The division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make US networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses, worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace.\nIn the last 12 months Mr Yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur. The warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks. The Cyber Security Division also audited US government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network. The next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers. Mr Yoran's division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals. Despite this success Mr Yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week, reportedly only giving one day's notice to bosses at the Department of Homeland Security. \"Amit Yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year, and we appreciate his efforts in starting the department's cybersecurity program,\" said a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman. Some reports have suggested that Mr Yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net-based threats in the wider homeland organisation. An attempt by US politicians to pass a law to promote Mr Yoran and raise the profile of his department's work is now mired in Congress.",
    "Oil prices carried on rising on Wednesday after cold weather on both sides of the North Atlantic pushed US crude prices to four-month highs.\nFreezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls took crude oil prices past $50 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since November. Declines in the dollar have also contributed to the rising oil price. US crude was trading at $51.39 at 0710 GMT in Asian electronic trade on Wednesday. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 at $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that, given such high prices, the cartel saw no reason to cut its output.\nAlthough below last year's peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004's average of $41.48. Brent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close.\nMuch of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. \"The primary factor is the weak dollar,\" said Victor Shum, a Singapore-based analyst with Purvin and Gertz. Expectations that a rebound in the dollar would halt the oil price rise were not immediately borne out on Wednesday morning, as oil prices carried on upwards as the dollar strengthened against the euro, the pound and the yen.\nSeveral Opec members said on Tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. \"I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,\" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters. \"I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,\" he added.",
    "Tony Blair has dismissed reports he told Gordon Brown he would quit before the next general election.\n\"You don't do deals over jobs like this,\" the prime minister told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme. According to a new book, Brown's Britain, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004. Mr Blair said the claims were \"reheated from six months ago\" and that he was concentrating on running the country. Mr Blair said: \"I've dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't.\n\"What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.\" The book, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston and serialised in the newspaper, said the pair had \"mutual animosity and contempt\" for each other.\nIt claims Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party. And that at a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott he told Mr Brown of his intention to stand down. According to Mr Peston the prime minister said: \"Help me to get through the year and I will then stand down.\" But he then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.\nMr Peston told BBC News: \"My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. \"What the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. \"I think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright, but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.\" But, in a wide-ranging BBC interview covering issues such as the Asian tsunami disaster, the Middle East peace process and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair said: \"When you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you. \"All sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims.\" He admitted to a \"sense of frustration\" about the allegations which he said had been made \"countless times\".\nThere has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami. These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blair's decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa. There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster. But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a \"load of nonsense\". Former welfare minister Frank Field MP said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown, but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so.\nTory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of \"squabbling like schoolboys\". He told Sky News' Sunday with Adam Boulton: \"This is the politics of the playground and Britain really does deserve better.\" The Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was \"getting in the way of good government\". \"Either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election.\" During the interview Mr Blair also said the former home secretary David Blunkett would play a \"big role\" at the general election.",
    "England coach Andy Robinson says English rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players' careers.\nHe will be without a host of big names for the Six Nations as the intensity of professional rugby union hits players. \"Injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the English season,\" Robinson told BBC Sport. \"I think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers.\" Robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the Six Nations with the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Will Greenwood injured.\nRugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago. As a result three of the major stakeholders in English rugby have launched an \"injury audit\" to find out how players are coping. The audit is jointly funded by the Professional Rugby Players' Association, the Rugby Football Union and Premier Rugby. As far as Robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored. \"I think there's an injury audit coming out in March that's got some great information in there that I think everybody in the English game has got to look at,\" he said. \"If we don't the situation is going to get worse and not better, so I think rugby as a whole has got to look at this.\"",
    "Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a \"super union\" of two million members.\nThe move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that \"nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda\" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday. Amicus's executive was due to meet in any case although the TGWU is holding specially scheduled talks.",
    "Actress Nicole Kidman has won a restraining order against two paparazzi photographers who she claims left her fearful of leaving her Sydney mansion.\nThe Oscar-winning star took action against Jamie Fawcett and Ben McDonald after a bugging device was found outside her home earlier this week. Lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device. The Australian actress is currently in Sydney to film her latest movie, Eucalyptus, with Russell Crowe. Kidman was prompted to take action following a reported high-speed car chase with members of the paparazzi in Sydney last weekend.\nAccording to local newspaper the Daily Telegraph, the incident involved paparazzi driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road in pursuit of Kidman's vehicle. Lawyers for Mr Fawcett and Mr McDonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase. Kidman sought the \"apprehended violence\" orders - normally used in Australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents - after being advised to do so by local police. \"Nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that,\" said Kidman's publicist Wendy Day. \"However, these are specific actions against two individuals who, over a period of time, have caused her to feel threatened, intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety.\" Magistrate Lee Gilmore, who issued the restraining order at Waverley Local Court in Sydney, said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour. \"Miss Kidman says she's willing to put up with some of it, but it's gone beyond that,\" she said. \"I do believe the allegation in relation to the driving is a serious issue.\"",
    "Oracle has announced it is cutting about 5,000 jobs following the completion of its $10.3bn takeover of its smaller rival Peoplesoft last week.\nThe company said it would retain more than 90% of Peoplesoft product development and product support staff. The cuts will affect about 9% of the 55,000 staff of the combined companies. Oracle's 18-month fight to acquire Peoplesoft was one of the most drawn-out and hard-fought US takeover battles of recent times. The merged companies are set to be a major force in the enterprise software market, second only in size to Germany's SAP.\nIn a statement, Oracle said it began notifying staff of redundancies on Friday and the process would continue over the next 10 days. \"By retaining the vast majority of Peoplesoft technical staff, Oracle will have the resources to deliver on the development and support commitments we have made to Peoplesoft customers over the last 18 months,\" Oracle's chief executive Larry Ellison said in a statement.\nCorrespondents say 6,000 job losses had been expected - and some suggest more cuts may be announced in future. They say Mr Ellison may be trying to placate Peoplesoft customers riled by Oracle's determined takeover strategy. Hours before Friday's announcement, there was a funereal air at Peoplesoft's headquarters, reported AP news agency. A Peoplesoft sign had been turned into shrine to the company, with flowers, candles and company memorabilia. \"We're mourning the passing of a great company,\" the agency quoted Peoplesoft worker David Ogden as saying. Other employees said they would rather be sacked than work for Oracle. \"The new company is going to be totally different,\" said Anil Aggarwal, Peoplesoft's director of database markets. \"Peoplesoft had an easygoing, relaxed atmosphere. Oracle has an edgy, aggressive atmosphere that's not conducive to innovative production.\" On the news, Oracle shares rose 15 cents - 1.1% - on Nasdaq. In after-hours trading the shares did not move.",
    "The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.\nThe Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn. The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn. The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.\nDemocrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.",
    "Thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in England and Wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.\nThe Countryside Alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal, but vowed to stay within the law. Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. One anti-hunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in Kent.\nThe man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the East Kent Hunt, near Ashford. In Wiltshire, police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs. The group, from South Wales and Ireland, have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.\nIt is believed more than 270 hunts went out on Saturday, just one day after the ban came in.\nThey were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country, with actor Jeremy Irons and former minister Kate Hoey among the supporters. Anti-hunt groups - such as the League Against Cruel Sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.\nMike Hobday, from the league, said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police. \"Our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law, many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting. \"However, we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across Britain.\" BBC correspondent Simon Hall at Postbridge on Dartmoor in the West Country said 2,000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.\nAnd the BBC's Sarah Mukherjee, with the Beaufort Hunt in Badminton, Gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt, with 150 on horseback. Tom Heap, BBC rural affairs correspondent, said it appeared that hunstman had, for now, been sticking to the new rules. And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday, he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.\nBefore riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: \"We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned.\" Judith Moritz, in Melton Mowbray, said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of Leicestershire, but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers. The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was \"impossibly difficult to determine\" and open to different interpretations.\nChief executive Simon Hart said: \"There has been hunting in England for 700 years. This [ban] may take two or three years, perhaps two or three months, to unpick. \"It will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service, as broadcasters say.\" Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed. Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts. The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law. He said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police \"in the near future\" to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.",
    "The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.\nThe Public and Commercial Services Union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.\nPCS leader Mark Serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.\n\"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\" BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented \"a formidable force\" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election. A stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.\nOpposition to raising the retirement age is \"one thing all the unions are agreed on\", our correspondent added. Unison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night. Our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations. There was \"some possibility\" of the strike action being avoided, he added.",
    "Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the \"stakes are too high\" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.\nThe chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 May - would give a \"clear and fundamental\" choice between Labour investment and Tory cuts. He told his party's spring conference the Tories must not be allowed to win. The Conservatives and Lib Dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under Labour.\nTo a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, Mr Brown accused shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country. Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: \"I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. \"Never again Tory boom and bust.\n\"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more.\" Turning to the economy, the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.\nHe also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. And he promised help to get young people on the property ladder. \"My message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto,\" he said. \"And the next Labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers' initiative.\" In the speech, which prompted a standing ovation, he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.\nHe also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. Responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, George Osborne, said: \"This was more talk from Gordon Brown. \"We've heard it all before. Instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past. \"He completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans. \"There will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the Conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\"\nLiberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable warned the picture was not as rosy as Mr Brown would like to portray it. \"For all his trumpeting of Labour's management of the economy, Gordon Brown's record is very mixed,\" he said. \"Gordon Brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy, a system which subjects millions of people to means testing, and a system of taxation which is extremely complex. \"For all his positive words, Gordon Brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon, not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation.\" Also in Gateshead, the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign. Mr Blair told the audience he believed the Iraq war would have made Britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible, but not before the job was done. He also said he wanted to carry on as PM \"because I still think that there are big changes our country needs\".",

Don't worry we've got it,\" Edelman told BBC Sport. \"Hopefully, we'll spend it this summer and in the coming years. Arsene attends all our board meetings and he knows our finances are very strong.\"\nEdelman added that it was pointless having a brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings. \"Its great to have nice, new surroundings, but if the team aren't performing on the pitch, then there isn't great respect in having a fabulous stadium,\" he said. \"It's important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place, before we began on the stadium.\"",
    "Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer.\nHe had to settle for bronze in Greece behind fellow American Justin Gatlin and Francis Obikwelu of Portugal. \"It really hurts to look at that medal. It was my mistake. I lost because of the things I did,\" said Greene, who races in Birmingham on Friday. \"It's never going to happen again. My goal - I'm going to win the worlds.\" Greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind Gatlin, who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. \"In my semi-final race, I should have won the race but I was conserving energy. \"That's when Francis Obikwelu came up and I took third because I didn't know he was there. \"I believe that's what put me in lane seven in the final and, while I was in lane seven, I couldn't feel anything in the race.\n\"I just felt like I was running all alone. \"I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me.\" Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg. The Kansas star is set to go head-to-head with Lewis-Francis again at Friday's Norwich Union Grand Prix. The pair contest the 60m, the distance over which Greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds. He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August. Greene believes Gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in Finland. But he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown. \"There's always someone else coming. I think when I was coming up I would say there was me and Ato (Boldon) in the young crowd,\" Greene said. \"Now you've got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time.\"",
    "Charlie Simpson took his new band Fightstar to the stage on Friday night, just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band Busted.\nHe was greeted by a sell-out crowd at the University of Warwick. Confirmation of Busted's long-rumoured split had come earlier in the day, when Simpson held a press conference in London with bandmates Matt Willis and James Bourne. All three band members stressed that the break up was amicable, although Bourne admitted he was \"devastated\" to hear of Simpson's departure. \"This has been a really difficult decision,\" 19-year-old Simpson revealed, \"I hope the fans will understand.\"\nWhile Simpson declared he would look back with pride on Busted's enormous success, his focus turned immediately to Fightstar, with Friday's press conference coinciding with the start of the band's 13-date tour of the UK. Fuelled by this news, all 1,400 tickets to see Charlie's first post-Busted live appearance - at the University of Warwick's Student Union - sold out rapidly. Mike Eccleshall, the venue's Promotions Coordinator, said: \"Tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days, but sales went mad after the news broke. We had completely sold out by 4pm.\"\nWith queues outside the venue long and expectations high, the pressure was on Fightstar to impress. Although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country, they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students, the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any Busted concert. Gone were the screaming girls to which Simpson had become accustomed. Support act Brigade, fronted by Simpson's brother, played a short set first and were met with general approval. When Fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm, however, a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd.\nUnfortunately, the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as Simpson's guitar amplifier failed to work. As sound technicians rushed to fix it, other band members did their best to improvise. When they eventually got under way, Fightstar's blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. Far heavier and less commercial than Busted's chart-topping pop-punk, the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. Warwick student Helen Clutterbuck admitted: \"I came to check out Fightstar because of all the controversy. \"I've never heard them before, but I'm pretty impressed.\" Less impressed were fellow students Ryan Crabbe and Gordon Rennie, who observed, \"With Fightstar, Charlie has clearly progressed from Busted's sound, but they're still not very inspiring.\" Fightstar played for around 45 minutes, showcasing material from their forthcoming EP called They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, due for release in February.",
    "India's biggest carmaker Maruti has reported a sharp increase in quarterly profit after a booming economy and low interest rates boosted demand.\nNet profit surged 70% to 2.39bn rupees ($54.98m; £29.32m) in the last three months of 2004 compared with 1.41bn rupees a year earlier. Total sales were 30.1bn rupees, up 27% from the same 2004 period. Maruti accounts for half of India's domestic car sales, luring consumers with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles.\nDemand in India also has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said.\nFigures show that only eight people per thousand are car owners. Maruti beat market expectations despite an increase in raw materials costs. The company, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki, said an increase in steel and other raw material prices was partially offset by cost cutting. Sales in the fiscal third quarter, including vans and utility vehicles, rose by 17.8% to 136.069 units. Maruti is not the only company benefiting as Indian's economic growth gives consumer greater spending power. Utility vehicle and tractor maker Mahindra has reported a 52% rise in net profit during the last three months of 2004. Profit was 1.33bn rupees compared with 874.2m rupees a year earlier.",
    "Harry Potter director Alfonso Cuaron has signed a three-year deal with Hollywood studio Warner Brothers, according to Variety trade magazine.\nThe Mexican film-maker, who directed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, will produce mainstream movies and smaller Spanish-language films. \"We had a wonderful experience with Alfonso on Harry Potter,\" Warner producer Jeff Robinov told Variety. Cuaron's other films include Mexican movie Y Tu Mama Tambien.\nThe 2001 rites-of-passage drama about two teenage boys who embark on a relationship with an older woman, brought Cuaron international attention - and box office glory.\nIt also won him and his brother Carlos, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Warner will distribute Cuaron's films in several languages outside the US. \"This deal will give us the opportunity to collaborate with Alfonso on movies that make the most of his artistry and vision, and continue to offer him the mainstream worldwide audiences that our studio provides so successfully,\" said Mr Robinov.\nHis first film for Warner Brothers was 1995's family fantasy movie A Little Princess. Based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, A Little Princess tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live in a New York boarding school when her widowed father enlists for war. After the erotic nature of Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third Harry Potter film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike.",
    "British actress Antonia Bernath is making her debut in Kisna - the Warrior Poet, marking a growing trend for non-Indian stars to appear in Bollywood films.\nDirected by Bollywood veteran Subhash Ghai, the film is set in the British Raj and Bernath plays an army general's daughter who falls in love with a rural boy, Kisna. \"I liked the fluid nature of film-making. We improvised quite a lot,\" says Bernath. \"At times it felt very chaotic but Mr Ghai was quite clear about what he wanted.\" Picked from more than 200 girls in an audition in London, Bernath cut short her education at Bristol's Old Vic Theatre School to take up the opportunity. It is not often that somebody gets to play the lead role straight out of a drama school. She spent three weeks learning Hindi and taking dance lessons. \"Initially, I was a bit sceptical about how people would respond to me,\" Bernath says. \"But I found the Hindi film industry very warm and encouraging. I even had a few offers before the work on Kisna was completed.\"\nFilms are one of India's biggest exports and those like Lagaan and Monsoon Wedding have broken the traditional boundaries of colour and culture. Spurred by this, Bollywood producers are trying to go global in all aspects of film-making, be it technical or artistic.\nFrom young heart-throbs like Nick Moran of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to model Sophie Dahl, many non-Indian stars want to make the most of this opportunity. \"Bollywood has truly gone global,\" says Taran Adarsh, editor of Indian film journal Trade Guide. \"Directors are now attempting to woo non-Asian audience to increase their share in the overseas film market.\" Kisna has been shot simultaneously in Hindi and English, with the English print shortened by an hour to accommodate the Western audience. The film even has a song composed in English by AR Rahman, the director of the popular West End musical, Bombay Dreams. \"Identification is a popular cinematic device. Use of European or American actors can be viewed as a step in that direction,\" says Adarsh.\nThe cast of Kisna also includes British actors Michael Maloney, Caroline Langrishe and Polly Adams.\nAnother actress, Annabelle Wallace, plays the lead role in a bilingual romantic comedy Dil Jo Bhi Kahey (Whatever the Heart Says), which also stars Indian screen legend Amitabh Bachchan. Actor and Producer Aamir Khan's forthcoming venture The Rising is set against the backdrop of the Indian mutiny of 1857, with British actor Toby Stephens in a key role. But it isn't only the Western actors looking eastwards.

    "Chancellor Gordon Brown will meet his golden economic rule \"with a margin to spare\", according to his former chief economic adviser.\nFormerly one of Mr Brown's closest Treasury aides, Ed Balls hinted at a Budget giveaway on 16 March. He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. Any rate rise ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning, he added. Last July, Mr Balls won the right to step down from his Treasury position and run for parliament, defending the Labour stronghold of Normanton in West Yorkshire.\nMr Balls rejected the allegation that Mr Brown had been sidelined in the election campaign, saying he was playing a \"different\" role to the one he played in the last two elections. He rejected speculation that Mr Brown was considering becoming Foreign Secretary, saying his recent travels had been linked to efforts to boost international development. Gordon Brown's decision to announce the date of the Budget while on a trip to China was a \"sensible thing to do\", since he was talking about skills and investment at the time, Mr Balls told the BBC. Commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise, he said it was not within the remit of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to factor a potential election into its rate decisions. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed that house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"I don't believe it would be a big election issue in Britain or a problem for Labour,\" Mr Balls said. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May as the likely day.",
    "All Blacks captain Tama Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour.\nBut Umaga, in England for Saturday's IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told BBC Sport: \"It's potentially the most fearsome line-up I've ever come up against. They're awesome. \"But I'd back us all the way to beat them when they come over.\" Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month.\nWhen Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former England players. But Umaga said: \"He'd be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. \"Don't get me wrong, England have got a lot of talented guys and I'm sure there are some of them who'll make the Lions Test XV. \"But you can't disguise Wales and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they've scored have been great. I'll admit it'll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O'Driscoll.\"\nUmaga will meet O'Driscoll in Saturday's Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side. O'Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. \"It'll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,\" Umaga said. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was immense, calling it \"the biggest thing to hit New Zealand since Lord of the Rings\". He added: \"As players, it's enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it's not just us All Blacks - it's the talk of the country.\"\nUmaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday's charity game, which features a host of big names including George Gregan, Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. \"The second [Southern Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I didn't hesitate. It was great when New Zealand Rugby then gave me the all clear. \"Thankfully I didn't know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn't miss all the horrific reports on the news. \"There are so many people that were affected, are still affected and will be affected for a long time. It's just good to know we can do something minor to help out.\"\n- The match will be televised on BBC One at 1400 GMT on Saturday.",
    "Glenn Hoddle has been unveiled as the new Wolves manager.\nThe ex-England coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed Dave Jones, who was sacked after the club's poor start to the season. Wolves chairman Rick Hayward said: \"We're delighted Glenn is here. He has a six-month contract so we can test each other out and see if it works.\" Hoddle, who will work alongside Stuart Gray, has been out of the game since he was sacked by Spurs in 2003. Gray, who has been caretaker manager, was assistant boss when Hoddle was manager at Southampton. \"I'm delighted to be here,\" said Hoddle.\n\"I saw the massive potential that Wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the Premiership parallels my ambitions. \"Stuart Gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager. We've worked together at Southampton and I'm delighted to be back with him.\" Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey defended the decision to give Hoddle a short-term contract. \"We hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term,\" he said. \"Most managers want a four-year contract and then expect it to be paid off if it doesn't work out. \"For somebody of Glenn's calibre to come in on a short-term contract and put his reputation on the line, it demonstrates his commitment and self-belief and the potential he thinks is here.\" Hayward revealed that Hoddle was one of the first to be approached after Jones' departure. \"He was not available at the time because he was looking at various other things,\" he explained. \"Five weeks later we're back on track and this a tremendous opportunity for Wolves.\"\nHoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job. His spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. The 47-year-old later returned to management with Southampton, where he again succeeded Jones - as he has now done at Wolves. He engineered an upturn in Saints' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. That relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the London club early last season. Since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of France manager and had also been linked with a return to Southampton. Wolves are currently 17th in the Championship and have a home game against Millwall on Tuesday.",
    "Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned.\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to end its Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) on midnight of 31 December. Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\nIt added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.",
    "Former All Black star Jonah Lomu says he cannot wait to run out on the pitch for former England rugby union captain Martin Johnson's testimonial on 4 June.\nThe 29-year-old had a kidney transplant in July 2004 but will play his first full match for three years, leading a southern hemisphere side at Twickenham. \"I actually started training three weeks after my operation but I was very limited until a few months ago. \"Now it's basically bring it on!\" said the giant winger. \"The match on 4 June will be my first 15-man game but I have a training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and a whole lot of things,\" said Lomu. \"I have got so much energy since my operation that I train three times a day, six days a week.\n\"Mohammed Ali has always been my ideal. Coming back to rugby, people said 'you are dreaming' but it always starts off with a dream. \"It's up to you whether you want to make it a reality.\" Opinion has been divided on whether Lomu should attempt to return to the game after such a major operation. But when Lomu was asked whether he was taking a risk he replied: \"As much as someone going down the road being hit by a bus. \"There are a lot of people in the world with one kidney who just don't know it. \"I have talked this over, had a chat with the donor and this is to set my soul at peace and finish something I started in 1994 [when he made his All Blacks debut].\" At his lowest ebb Lomu was so ill he could barely walk, but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long-term target is to play for New Zealand again. \"The only person who saw me at my worst was my wife,\" he added. \"I used to take two steps and fall over but now I can run and it is all coming back, and a lot more quickly than I ever thought it would. \"To play for the All Blacks would be the highest honour I could get. That is the long-term goal and you have to start somewhere.\"",
    "Hollywood actors Samuel L Jackson and Ben Stiller have signed up for Ricky Gervais' new sitcom, the comedian has told BBC News.\nHe said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom Extras. They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\" Gervais told BBC News.\n\"It's not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.\n\"I didn't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven't even been asked. \"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore's part. I haven't been approached and I wouldn't take it anyway.\"\nHe said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \"twisted\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \"would sail pretty close to the bone\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \"A film will happen over the next three years but I don't want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn't be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\"",
    "Talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.\nFive public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain's biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.\nThe five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the \"less painful\" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. \"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\"\nUnison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.",
    "Singer Britney Spears is suing eight insurance companies that have refused to reimburse her for cancelling her 2004 world tour.\nThe pop star cancelled her Onyx Hotel tour last June after suffering a knee injury during a video shoot. She is now seeking to be reimbursed for the tour's £5m ($9.3m) costs in a claim filed at New York State Supreme Court. Seven London-based companies and an eighth Paris firm have been given up to 30 days to respond to the complaint.\nThe 22-year-old star initially missed a number of shows on the 82-date tour after injuring her knee during a show in Illinois last March. But she was rushed to hospital and needed surgery after a later incident while filming a video for her song Outrageous, leading her to cancel the rest of the tour, including dates in China. \"She obviously took a wrong step and blew out her knee,\" a Jive spokeswoman said at the time. \"It was an old dance injury.\" The legal submission described Spears as \"one of the most recognised performers in her industry\". The Onyx Hotel tour was cited as \"a highly crafted production which included the well-known music and dancing of Spears, supported by elaborate costumes, complex choreography as well as cutting-edge video production, lighting and other effects\". In September Spears married Kevin Federline, who had been a dancer on the aborted tour.",
    "Manchester City's Paul Bosvelt will find out \"within a month\" whether he is to be offered a new one-year deal.\nThe 34-year-old Dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and, although his age may count against him, he feels he can play on for another season. \"I told the club I would like to stay for one more year. They promised me an answer within the next month so I am waiting to see,\" he said. \"The main concern is my age but I think I have proved I am fit enough. Bosvelt joined City from Feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in England. But his professionalism and dedication impressed manager Kevin Keegan. \"He realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team. He is an unsung hero,\" said Keegan.",
    "The ultimate prize of 10 Downing Street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget, Gordon Brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.\nHe reached that milestone last June, when he overtook David Lloyd George, who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. How much longer Mr Brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: \"those who fail and those who get out in time.\") There are rumours he will be moved to the Foreign Office if Labour wins the general election. But, for now, Mr Brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.\nGordon Brown was born in Glasgow on 20 February 1951, the son of a Church of Scotland Minister in the small Fife town of Kirkcaldy. At 12, he was canvassing for Labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in Scotland. He achieved a first class degree in history from Edinburgh University, where he went on to complete a PhD. His early career was spent lecturing, working in television and making a name for himself in the Scottish Labour Party.\nHis first attempt to enter Westminster, for Edinburgh South in 1979, was thwarted by the present Tory spokesman on foreign affairs, Michael Ancram. But in 1983, he took Dunfermline East, a new constituency including Rosyth naval base, pit villages and coastal towns.\nEntering Westminster, he came to share an office with the newly elected MP for Sedgefield, Tony Blair. Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. He became shadow chancellor under John Smith's leadership in 1992. After the death of leader John Smith in 1994 he stood aside, agreeing to give Tony Blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the Granita restaurant in Islington.\nThe other part of the deal, that Mr Blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of Westminster legend. Mr Blair's supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. But if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, Mr Brown continued his devotion to politics. During the 1997 election campaign, he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day, six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.\nThis dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by Mr Brown's former girlfriend of five years, Princess Marguerite of Romania, the eldest daughter of ex-King Michael of Romania, who said a relationship with him was \"politics, politics, politics\".\nIf that was true then, Mr Brown, who married PR executive Sarah Macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. Their daughter Jennifer died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, 10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. A year later, in October 2003, the couple had a son - John - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. A trip to Africa earlier this year, to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations, also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.\nThe ideological differences between Mr Brown and Mr Blair remain relatively modest. The chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the NHS and is seen as being more \"Old Labour\" than Mr Blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. But their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the New Labour project. Yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict, with Mr Brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger Downing Street neighbour over the succession. Mr Blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful Mr Brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his Budget until the last possible minute. After a recent run of negative headlines, Labour MPs took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering, for the good of the party. Events like this, and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues, make it impossible to dismiss the Brown/Blair feud as just journalistic hearsay, cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of Westminster. How much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question.\nA truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by Blairite Alan Milburn being brought in over the head of Mr Brown to run the election campaign. But with the Tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that Mr Brown - using the Budget as a springboard - is to revitalise Labour's campaign. Amid all this it is easy to forget that Mr Brown remains the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader. There may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including Mr Milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that Mr Brown can. And Mr Blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given Mr Brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister's intention to \"serve a full third term\" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.",
    "The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline.\nBrazil's airport authority chief Carlos Wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save Varig, Brazil's flagship airline. However, the country's vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. Varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais ($2.3bn or £1.2bn). Asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country's Congress to discuss the airline's crisis, Mr Alencar replied: \"No, I don't think so. We will see.\"\nEarlier, Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week. \"In practice, it will be an intervention, although this is not the technical name used\", he said. An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. For that to happen Varig's main shareholder, the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline's employees, would have to be removed, Mr Wilson said. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. Varig, which operates in 18 countries apart from Brazil, has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country's economic downturn.\nThe depreciation of Brazil's currency has had a direct impact on the airline's dollar debt as well as some of its costs. Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the Brazilian economy. The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m), after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992. But the government can appeal the decision.",
    "Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer, has died.\nMr Raskin was one of the first employees at Apple and made many of the design decisions that made the Mac so distinctive when it was first released. He led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. The 1984 release of the Mac reflected Mr Raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use.\nMr Raskin joined Apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead the company's publications department. However, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.\nThe result was the 1984 Macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. Users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing, clicking and dragging. Although now in common use in almost all computers, these methods were pioneering when first used in the Macintosh. The GUI was developed by Xerox PARC, and used in its Star machine. But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer. \"His role on the Macintosh was the initiator of the project, so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him,\" said Andy Hertzfeld, an early Macintosh team member. Although Mr Raskin drove the team that created the Macintosh he did not stay at Apple to see it released. In 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with Apple's mercurial boss Steve Jobs. In 1982, Mr Raskin left Apple entirely. The Macintosh was reputedly named after Mr Raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. After leaving Apple, Mr Raskin founded another company called Information Appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. He was also an accomplished musician, played three instruments and conducted San Francisco's Chamber Opera Society. Mr Raskin was diagnosed in December 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 February at his home in California.",
    "The law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales is enforceable and \"very clear\", Alun Michael has said.\nThe rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law, which came into force on Friday, and pretended they were not. Some 270 hunts met legally on Saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds. But anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. Countryside Alliance chairman John Jackson said that Saturday had been a \"massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting\". People had turned out \"to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law\", he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed \"legally\" as far as he was aware.\nAlthough hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: \"There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting. \"The reality is that the law is very clear. You can't chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs, whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer. \"If people do so and pretend they're not it's going to become very clear. You can't hunt accidentally.\" Mr Michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. He said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy, the health service and their children's future than hunting.\nBut the League Against Cruel Sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. Thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across England and Wales on the first day of the ban, with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken. There were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in Wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the Hunting Act.\nThey have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. But Penny Little, who monitored the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, said she had witnessed \"gratuitous, spiteful killing of foxes\". If people tried to \"run circles around this law\" the only outcome would be that it was tightened up, she said. Mike Hobday, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. He said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. But Mr Jackson, who had been at the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, denied there was any intimidation.",

He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I had zero anxiety about getting this shot, I’m a perfectly healthy 26 year old male. However, I had a terrible experience getting the first vaccine. Two minutes after injection, my ears start ringing and I become lightheaded. Next, my vision starts to blacken and become distorted. This intensified for several minutes and I was sweating an insane amount. At this point I’m freaking tf out because I can’t see nor can I hear and I know I’m like the only person having this experience. I did not flag anyone down I just waited in panic hoping my senses would return. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was only 3 minutes, my vision started to return and I suddenly got freezing although I continued to sweat. I left feeling like I just had intercourse against my will, and I also did not tell anyone at the site. I now feel very reluctant to get the 2nd Pfizer dose and am overall just still shocked I had such a terrible experience. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I have told someone?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I don’t know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",
    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",
    "We’ve been in a relationship since 7 years now , there were a few months where we not in  contact because I wanted a break from this and also when things went wrong real bad  we had a break for 4 months but then got back . I’ve been trying to hold this relationship and make it all work since 8 months now and it’s been very rough which includes me crying since 4 months straight everyday , he gave me many traumatic experiences which are hard to forget till date like lying for every small to big thing , body insecurities where I felt inadequate unworthy.  Having  a good enough body but just a smaller chest with inverted nipples , he made me feel little about my 2 insecurities and never enough . I still held on until now but I’ve begun to question is it worth it ? Will someone love me better ? I used to be scared with the process of falling in love all over again but now my hurt in this relationship has gone so beyond that I don’t know , if putting an end to this relationship which is my everything is the best thing I can/should do .",
    "Sooo you know how every character has 3 lives in the Dream Smp? How did they get those 3 lives in the first place? What if the second and third lives are just copies of the FIRST life. You may say this makes no sense but how do you just die and come back all fine with all your memories? Also there is a book called the revive book on the server which only dream possesses and has been used TWICE. Once on Tommy and once on Henry his pet cow. Which shows that the revive book can be used multiple times and the person you used it on gains all their memories after revival. So what if you can revive the \"copies\" or your \"lives\" that you have lost through the revive book basically creating infinite copies of you with all your memories. I mean they have to go some where right? The dead have to go somewhere RIGHT? Comment on this post if you think this theory is viable or its just bs. Also I have another question that is how or who created/found the revive book and gave it to Jschlatt who then gave it to Dream?",
    "Every Sunday night, my girlfriend and I FaceTime each other in order talk about our week and bring up any unresolved issues. While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer. I said yes because I assumed it was urgent and it was only going to be a 1 or 2 minute call. 20 minutes go by and they’re still on the phone while I’m there on FaceTime with her and she’s having a whole conversation with him. I became pretty upset over this, so I hung up the call and messaged her saying to call me when she’s done. She then proceeded to FaceTime the guy and she told me they were just doing homework together. I don’t know what to think of this. Any advice would be helpful, like is this normal or appropriate?",
    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

I just got done copying my friend's work on things I was supposed to pass one whole semester ago but some works I still need to do I just can't copy. It's those activities where you take a video of yourself giving a speech or acting or something like that. I can't do it because I hate looking at myself and I can't muster up any will to do it. I just want to say to my teacher that i don't want to do it. It's stupid but I thought of using text to speech and just having a static image of my face, but i can't even do that cause the text to speech for my language is horrible. Do I just say that I won't pass it? I don't see myself graduating anyway whether or not I complete this activity.",

    "I recently got a job, pay's decent and kind of fun, but it has no benefits and is far from a forever job. I really like the owner and wouldn't want to screw him over when the time does come to leave. When accepting a new position, how do you go about the whole two week notice thing? Are employers actually cool with saying,\" Oh I can start in two weeks.\"? It feels to me like an employer might be upset or go with someone else if you can't start soon/immediately, but that may not really be the case in the professional world. I'm just not really sure how to tread that path as I've always had a period between each job, so have not had to deal with breaking it off with one company and beginning another at the same time.",
    "It’s getting so much worse I don’t want to leave my house but I’m too scared to stay alone. When there is a storm I panic and my stomach hurts so bad. Like even when there is slight rain or the clouds look weird I start panicking. I hate hearing noises except for my fan, phone and soft voices from the tv. Where I live tornados happen a lot and it scares me so much I don’t know how to deal with it. I always have really bad dreams of me dying in a storm, tornado or tsunami it happens to very day and it makes me not want to sleep. I have to wait for myself to pass out to actually get any sleep.

She refused to acknowlege that I have cancelled my phone service in December and that they overbilled my account. I even signed a new contract that removed the phone line from the account in December but she blantantly ignored that proof. I have called multiple times and was told that they were going to reflect in their system that the service was cancelled in December and that I would be issued a refund.  I have yet to receive my refund and this last representative refused to help me.  I am beyond frustrated with this company. What's worse is that Comcast is the only provider in my area so I am forced to deal with a company that is incompetent and lacks quality customer service.",

Just finished watching the latest 90 Day The Single Life and she is once again calling Mohamed trying to get yet another apology. It's been what, 7 years, since the whole relationship unraveled? She's asked for several apologies. None of the apologies have been sincere, and she just keeps going back for more. She'll never be satisfied. Obviously Mohamed feels no guilt. She's never going to get that apology from him. She just needs to get over the whole thing, close the chapter, and get on with her life. She's a total drama queen. It almost seems like she's a little obsessed with Mohamed. As much as I am not a Mohamed fan either, I actually think I feel sorry for him. She's that annoying cousin you can't get rid of.

    "Title pretty much explains it all, my cat hates his wet food. I know wet food is much better for cats than the dry stuff, but my little guys just won’t eat it 95% of the time, I put it out and he turns his head an walks away. I’ve tried many many different types of food, and he doesn’t like any of it. He absolutely loves the dry stuff though, sits there and meows and begs for it constantly. After a while of him not eating the wet stuff I usually end up caving and giving him the dry stuff cause, obviously, I don’t want him to starve. I know cats are supposed to eat the wet stuff, that’s where they get most of their fluids from and it’s just better in general, so I’d like to get him to eat it, but he just outright refuses most of the time. On the rare occasion he does eat it, he’ll just eat like half and then leave the rest. What the heck can I do? Should I just give up on the wet stuff and only give him dry? He does have a fancy little water fountain that I see him drinking out of, so I know he isn’t dehydrated, but the lack of eating good food is a bit concerning. He’s about 5 years old, and has kind of always been this way, but recently has gotten worse. I even bought him some special bowls because I was worried it might be whisker fatigue, but that hasn’t helped either. If anybody had any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",
    "Why exactly do you care how we choose to play your game? Why do you care how many legos we get and how fast we can murder the toughest enemies? Why do you care which classes and builds are the most popular? See, we already bought your full game and we liked it the way it was. You don't buy a car that you like, only for the salesman to come back later and ruin some of the best parts of your car that he already sold you. There's no microtransactions or DLC or anything else in this game that you still need to sell us. This is not some scammy F2P or live service game where devs nerf one thing to make the new cash cow more attractive and profitable. So yeah, I'm just really struggling to understand the logic behind all these nerfs here. You guys spent 5 years on your game and released it the way it is. We bought your game and liked it the way it was. So once again, why are you nerfing stuff? Did you guys hire a game designer from some F2P or live service game? Because this is the kind of stuff only they would do. Except it won't lead to profits for you, as there's nothing else to sell us. So you are only gonna lose players as a result.

    "So for the past couple of years I’ve gotten into a crazy bad habit of eating massive amounts of food late night. I’m not super active in working out but also not super out of shape from my eating habits. I’m 22, 6’0 213 pounds but I consume inhumane amounts of food late. I’ll go and get 6 different entree items from fast food joints at like 9 o clock at night and it makes me feel like shit. I’ll probably eat enough food for 2 or 3 people and not even think about it and I’ve tried dieting and can never seem to make it past a week or 2. I’ve left credit cards at home to insure I don’t go out and then I just started door dashing. Any advice on stopping this nasty habit?? My metabolism is only gonna get worse with age.

    "I got a bunch of money back from taxes today and I was excited because I wouldn’t have to worry about my bills. Then I decided to try to think of a way to treat myself. All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you. I’d give the whole sum up entirely to speak to you again or just to know if you were safe and happy. Yesterday was trans day of visibility I hope your day was safe and you had a good time. I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit. I still don’t know why you left but I would rather die than see you unhappy so I will keep this letter unsent.",
    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",

His pervert side is still annoying but i feel like it is author trying to be  funny but failing mostly. Otherwise he is really great later on even this situation when he said sorry to Mizuhara for not running after her made me sad for the guy and later on there where more moments where i really felt some emotions after him trying to open himself or trying to be brave.

    "Ages ago it has its battery changed; after it wouldn’t turn on with the battery plugged in nor would the battery take any charge. It has done little other than sit since unused since then. Recently I decided I’d try using it so I readied a bootable El Capitan usb as it’s hard drive is completely blank, but the MacBook wouldn’t turn on. I eventually found out that holding down the power button for 10 seconds and then plugging it in continuing to hold down the power button for another 10 seconds. When it does turn on the fans are full blast and whether it’s to El Capitan install, High Sierra install, internet recovery, or the hard drive from a know working MacBook it will only make it a little past halfway before shutting off and coming back on again only to repeat. If it is turned off anyway other than when it shuts itself off the 20 second power button thing has to be done again. I’ve tried an nvram/pram reset and the option+command+shift+power to no avail. On the inside there’s no evidence of water damage. I’ve been trying at it for two days now and I’m out of ideas as to what the problem could be.",
    "I feel so incredibly anxious. I can’t sit still. After a rollercoaster emotionally abusive relationship that lasted two years and after 1 year sharing an apartment together, I moved across the country for a while. After a month of not seeing him, I’m back. I’m seeing him tonight. The level of anxiety I feel is unreal. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without feeling nauseated with unease. We wanted to meet up to get closure for everything that happened, but it was a toxic relationship. He begged for me back a week ago and has been standoffish the last few days. He told me he’s incredibly depressed and wants to want to seek help, but it seems that he won’t. He’s erratic in his communication and seemingly his feelings toward me. He says he feels like it’s going to be weird to see each other and I feel the same, to an extent. Despite everything he’s done and everything that’s happened, I miss him and am excited to see him. I don’t know whether or not that’s wrong.. people who are close to me tell me that I shouldn’t see him at all. I can’t help but feel drawn to him, even if it’s for the last time.

Maybe they could have showed us a small glimp of the struggles people faced after the blip and the struggles the blip refugees are going through ,but none of it was hinted properly at all. It was just \"bad\" things that's happening and we're supposed to relate with that suddenly.",
    "I am like 90% sure Isayama was made to make the ending more digestable. Why, you ask? All we have to do is look at the Season 2 ED. EVERYTHING is a reference there, EVEN THE FUCKING BABY is in there. Do you know what was in there that we've never seen? The mass of people wandering away. Those surely had to be the collossals turning back. This in itself is not the reason why many people dislike the ending, but I can surely say that some things were fucked with, and I doubt that that was the only one. I can even imagine some executive telling him literally after 138 that \"yeah man your shits fucked up no way we can have those characters die. figure it out\" Jean and Connie were brought back without even them getting brought back. They just kind of.. appeared? I don't know, maybe it's just my last dose of copium, but I am convinced that this was not that was envisioned.",
    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it. It feels so good to have purpose again in my life and to seek out these challenges that are hard instead of running away from the hard things like I use to do.",
    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I know that I am overly quiet in social situations, and that it’s because a lot of the time I overthink anything I might say. Most of the time it keeps me from saying anything at all. I feel like it makes people think I’m stuck up or unapproachable. People tend to fill in the blanks if you know what I mean. A lot of people will say I should try not to think so much and just say the first thing that comes to mind, but the thing is on those rare occasions where I don’t overthink too much and start to get comfortable so I actually talk to people I feel like a lot of the time I’m awkward, and in ways I can’t always quite put my finger on either. Like I put my foot in my mouth or overshare or just say odd things that people don’t know how to respond to. It all makes me cringe and go back into that overthinking mode and I feel socially inept. It makes me want to cry and be a hermit. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just need to vent. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "So this post is going to be somewhat of a jumbled mess as I dictated in my car as I’m driving from my iPhone but I just had a thought after reading some news about student loan forgiveness and with all the money that’s been spent through the government I think there’s an agenda in motion to cancel Fiat currency and the future is going to be only a Cryptocurrency somewhat like China just did. the United States will probably create its own so I don’t know where that leaves all the currencies that we have now but I think it’s important that we invest as much as we can into these currency’s now. I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can. And thank you for reading this if you did. And please comment your thoughts",
    "Honestly, the storyline I'm most worried about in the show is the shipwreck storyline with Matthias and Nina. All the other storylines in the show, including the crows, tie in to Alina's story, and are all connected. But I feel like, especially for new viewers, the Helnik storyline is just gonna feel like a random shipwreck in a random part of the world with two random characters who we don't really care about and have nothing to do with the main storyline with Alina. I just feel like it will feel a bit random and disconnected to the rest of the plot, especially considering all the other plots are connected. Maybe they have come up with a sensible way to believably tie them together, but even then it doesn't really look like nina and matthias is gonna interact with or even meet any of the other characters, unless it's just one scene at the beginning or the ending. I think I am most worried about the fact that new viewers are gonna be confused and not really care about the storyline at all.",
    "A car accident has recently left me without a car. I sustained a back/neck injury in the accident that has left me unable to work, or even sit/stand for more than 15 minutes at a time. Because of this I have found cooking and cleaning very difficult, almost impossible.  This had lead to me needing to order out almost every meal. Funds are dwindling and I'm getting extremely overwhelmed. I've been finding it very difficult to even keep trying. I've been in too much pain to effectively  take care of myself. My lease is expiring soon and I'm still looking for another place as my landlord is no longer renting the house I'm staying in. I'm just stuck in a rut and can't find a light at the end of the tunnel. Does anyone have any words of advice?",
    "Does anyone else ever feel like when you're having a hard time with something, you have no one to turn to and confide in? I have trouble opening up to people and even though I'm one of the first to recommend therapy, I'm not currently IN therapy even though I know I should be. I feel like I can't even talk to my partner because they keep recommending therapy and while I know they aren't my therapist sometimes I just need to talk to someone. I moved to a new state in order to be with my partner a few years ago and have struggled hard with making new friends, got a better paying but less satisfying job, we're even expecting our first kid soon. I feel so unimportant and completely unnecessary in my own life. It's been a while since I felt like this, last time was a few years after my mom died.

    "I don't want to be like this - I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life posting about my heartaches. I don't romanticize heartbreaks. I dont intentionally torture myself with thoughts of you, they just come to me - like a thief in the night, leaving me robbed and helpless. There's nothing sweet about this and I'm far too logical for this. I don't enjoy wracking my brain, trying to find words that would best describe how I feel - and every time failing because no words could really come close to how gut wrenching, soul destroying this is. I put into words how I feel because supposedly it helps - I haven't seen any result yet at all. There's only one thing that would help me - and that only comprises of three letters - YOU. I'm so fed up with myself. I have no fucking illusions, no grandiose dreams of getting back together, of a happily ever after. I've lived in the fairy tale we have created long enough - and I'm living now my reality. I'm tired to my bones of feeling this way...I just want to move on. I'm not harboring any negative thoughts about you or about myself - no blaming, it is what it is. Some relationships are not meant to last, and some people are not meant to be together. That is life and I'm well too aware of it. But fuuuuuck, the pain. I just want it to stop. Now. Not when I'm six feet under the ground and I wouldn't give a fuck at all. I don't want to continue going through this anymore. I have accepted that we are not meant to be. I'm not angry about that. Just please, let me be free of this pain. Cause I just can't anymore.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country.

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",

I just tried another movie tonight and I had it set to direct stream, but it failed converting again. I had the mode set to auto, so I changed it to force and it loaded up super fast but said it couldn't detect any audio. So it played the direct stream 35mbps 4k beautifully, but without sound.

    "This started before I went on vacation, but out of know where or it came on gradually a burning and discomfort pain inside my penis all the way up to the groin. The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",

The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",
    "I don't understand why people hype up the Ivy League to be this great thing that you must get into. I personally didn't apply to any. Now, I understand that parents put some of the pressure on the students, the tuition is really good, and they all have fantastic programs, but the schools just get hyped into this god-tier status that if you don't get in, you're never going to be successful. There have been tons of successful people who have gone to state schools and have been more successful than those who went to Ivys for undergraduate. If you don't believe me, do a quick google search. Furthermore, jobs don't care about where you went to undergraduate. They care about what experience you have. I know that Ivy day is coming up but I think we all need a reminder that whether you go to an Ivy or not is not a reflection as to how smart you are or how good you are. Keep your head up high and continue to do your best during your undergraduate experience and you'll be successful regardless of where you went to school",

For the past three years or so, I have been consistently getting choppy haircuts with chunky layers that need to be fixed every time. I just got a haircut yesterday. The top 2/3 of my hair looks fine, but the bottom third looks about half as thick and very choppy and bizarre. I’m going to have to cut it again. I haven’t been able to grow my hair past shoulder length because this keeps happening. There’s no way that I just have bad luck picking hair dressers.

My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

The allies had pushed me back almost to Berlin but then I mounted a massive counter attack on the Eastern front and reached all the way to Stalingrad which capitulated Russia.

But still I mounted a western front counter attack and pushed the allies back to the Benelux border. My attacks were green across the bord and the troops I had spent the last year preparing were making short work of the entente. But then suddenly out of nowhere I get hit by the Versailles treaty.

    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant. I have been complimented on the smell of my hair multiple times but I do not know how to make my body smell very good. Does anyone have any good body wash recommendations, body lotions, body oils, or perfumes to make yourself smell really good? Has anyone been complimented on smelling good all the time, and if so, what do you use? I have heard the Yves Saint Lauren perfume is amazing and I will buy that, but I was also thinking of just using something to smell good all the time naturally, not exactly with perfumes all the time. And by smelling good, I mean I really want people to constantly compliment me on how good I smell when they get closer, I am not really talking about just preventing from smelling bad or smelling neutral, or decent, but just smelling really good. Let me know, thank you.",
    "So last night my roommates, some friends, and I were having a good time having a bonfire. I decided to get wonky for the social gathering so I kept going back inside to my room to snort more ket. We have like 5 snakes and my roommate was showing one of our guests her snakes but one of them nudged the heat lamp keeping them warm when they were going back outside to the fire. Some time passes and I decided to go inside and snort some more ket. But when I go inside it smelled like something was burning but I didn't think much of it since we were having a bon fire. I proceeded to my room until I got near the reptile room and saw a bunch of smoke in that area. I freaked out and looked for the source and saw it had something to do with the heat lamp. I was so wonked I really didn't know what was starting to burn and catch on fire but I immediately ran back outside to inform my roommates something was catching on fire. They come inside and fixed the situation. Man, that was a close call. Thank god for my ketamine addiction and that I decided to get wonky af that night. I could've not have a place to live today if I didn't want to go back inside to continue the wonk. I just felt the need to share this with everyone. Thank you guys for listening to my experience last night. That was pretty scary when I finally thought about it.",

In the milliseconds before someone hugs me, I think through how I will have to hold my arms, if they are going one arm up and one down or both up or both down or a side hug. For high-fives, it’s the same issue. Some people will grab your hand when you high-five, others have a weird pull you in for a hug thing, some grab your hand after slapping it and shake it or something.

    "I bought my first truck recently. It belonged to my dad’s boss who pretty much babies his vehicles. Only he let this sit for about a year. I got a pretty good deal on it considering which I wouldn’t normally do if my dad didn’t trust the guy. I couldn’t take it home at first because we found a fuel line leak. We repaired it and we jumped it and it ran really good. Until it died on an exit ramp. We got it towed home and it hasn’t started since. We’ve replaced the batter and now the ignition coil. It will turn over but it just won’t start. It’s an electrical problem because I’m not getting sparks from the ignition coil, hence the replacement. But still nothing.

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",

    "Like two months ago I was using my newly acquired prostate vibrator, so to get things into perspective I was laying in my back inside my bed just chilling with the vibrator in while I tried to meditate and then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere a huge wave from my prostate flew through my whole body, it was so fucking pleasurable and only took like 4 seconds it even made me open my mouth as if I was about to moan, never had anything like it again, no cum came out it was just so good, after those pleasurable 4 seconds I thought \"I have no idea of what the fuck that was but I loved it\", that shit is the only reason I am still into prostate play cause after that until now I have felt nothing from it again not even a p wave I think, am I doing something wrong, and for God's sake someone tell me what the fuck that was",
    "One time I went to a party in Dahlonega, we started out at Taco Mac getting really drunk. I started getting really frisky so the two guys I was there with took me out back to where their truck was parked, turn down the music in there truck, and we started our own party. Of course I started taking my clothes off and dancing for everybody that had gathered. I brought one guy up on the bed of the truck with me and started putting his hands all over me. Eventually he started touching me and feeling me up, he took off my pants and started finger me in front of everybody. And his buddy got up on the truck push me down on my knees and stuck its dick in my mouth. They put me down on all fours and spit roasted me for a while... Then other people started climbing on the truck, a few other women took off their clothes and we all started sucking each other. Mostly us girls and the guys watching sucking on each other's tits, licking each other's pussy, trying to fit as many fingers as we could inside each other. But some guys were still up in the truck fucking us and putting bottles in us, and other things they were finding, not quite sure what was inside me at some points. But of course someone had to spoil the fun and eventually the cops showed and threatened to start arresting people if we didn’t pack it up.",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "Easter night. 98 years old. I got to hold her hand, touch her hair, and kiss her forehead. I got to say goodbye hours before she passed. I took pictures of her photos hanging on her walls, I took in the smell of her bedroom, I walked around her kitchen with family one last time. It was such a beautiful day, perfect weather, the sun was shining, birds were chirping. My aunt said to me \"when I hear the birds sing, I'll always remember mom.\" It broke my heart. I love my grandma. I love my family. Every family has its problems, I learned so much just from sitting and listening to my aunts and uncle talk that those problems just didn't matter. We are family. They had so much wisdom and love to give to me. They knew I wasn't very close with her, but they let me sit as long as I needed with her. I'm so happy I didn't wait any longer to see her. My brothers didn't get to say goodbye, only me. I feel lucky to have looked into those blue eyes one last time. I know she loved me and I love her. Rest easy Nan, tell Papa and Nick we love and miss them dearly.",
    "My son just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago. We always give kisses and hugs but I told him for awhile now that I don't want him to kiss me on the lips. I use the term inappropriate because it's the best way I know how to put it for him to understand. He sees me kiss my husband tonight and he said that I shouldn't kiss daddy on the lips. I explained that because mommy and daddy are husband and wife that it's okay. I told him that if he ever gets a wife, he can kiss her on the lips too. And he simply said \"or him\". I told him that is exactly right. He can love whoever he loves. I'm so proud that he even thought to say that because he has been around a few trans people but never a gay couple before. Love is love little dude. ❤",
    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "The depersonalisation/derealization is increasing. Ive been mentally ill since i was 13, im now 23. The worst its ever been was in 2016/2017, and now its coming back severely. In 2017 i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, but my psychiatrists evaluation was short and he suspected schizophrenic psychosis as well. In other words schizoaffective disorder. I have a lot of trauma and cptsd symptoms. Ive painted since i was 5, and i cant describe with words all of the fantasy and creativity i have stuck inside my head. My paintings went from realism mixed with surrealism and now an increase in surrealism because of my dreams. I dont relate to most in my age and it makes me lonely and isolated. Most people dont percieve the world like i do even though i know there are some out there. But i cant find them. As im writing this im experiencing deja vu. I remember writing this before. I can see into the future but no one would believe me if i told them even though i can even prove it sometimes. I feel like i might not make it past 30 and i feel like this world is more of an illusion than we like to admit, but it doesnt matter. Im just exhausted and i dont know what to do.

    "So I’m terribly , horridly , confused about my sexuality . I’m a very very curious person by nature . I’m curious about everything . I’m a 17 year old girl in a homophobic family if that’s relevant . However , my friends and schools have always been very friendly and I’ve never been told that gay people were wrong by them . Lots of my friends have been bi , and it’s made me curious . I’ve fantasized about girls when I was 14, and these fantasies were sexual in nature. I had “crushes” on girls though idk if I should call them that . It was more being shocked at their beauty , and kinda fantasizing about them . Although if I ever had to date a girl I’d pass . Kissing a girl seems interesting but not desirable . I’d do it out of curiosity idk if I’d legitimately like them . When I was around that age , I’d wanted to be gay . Like I know how weird that sounds but I’ve had pretty bad experiences with boys . Lots of very poor male role models in my life , and my mom is pretty anti guys and tells me how awful all men are , when I was growing up . Some lesbians try to make themselves like men and even marry one right ? Could the same thing happen in reverse ? Fake attraction fueled by desperation. As of now , I find women beautiful the way flowers are , its aesthetic . My “crush” was extremely beautiful but I wouldn’t do anything with her not really . I’m so confused .",
    "\"We knew that fans were hungry for more Survivor--and so were we. We looked at this group of players and thought, 'these guys came ready to play.' And as always, we have to stay a step ahead of them. So we decided, let's put the game on fast-forward. 'You think you can take your time figuring out your strategy and looking for idols? Think again. Everybody else is talking and somebody already found the idol. And if you blink, you're voted out.' I think it's the natural evolution of the game. The last few seasons, every single vote is complex. Every single Tribal Council, the gameplay is aggressive and has consequences. So this is almost a response to that. 'You wanna play hard from the beginning? Got it. We'll make it harder.'\"",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

My mom decided to move back in with my stepdad in there house. I told her I was going to cancel the couch because she does not need it since she’s moving back in with my stepdad. does that make me wrong?

    "so Im 21.  My friends are all my age or younger and we are in our 3rd year of college.  They LOVE to drink.  I have since fallen back from drinking, and that has made me realize that I have little to nothing in common with them.  I like my friends a lot, but recently I noticed they tend to ignore my invites to do things that dont involve going to booze late at night.  Even normal, fun things that most people would like to do they arent interested in and will ignore my offer.  I get liking to drink, but holy fuck it seems like its their whole life purpose to get drunk.  This is a very hard time to meet new people as well, so I kinda just feel lost.  When i talk to them sober/when were not drinking and partying our conversations suuuuuuuuck.  Its like I just met them but these are people ive known for 2+ years.  I got a job on the weekends, and so far Ive had more fun at work with my coworkers than I have with my friends.  It sucks.  Its so stupid that society expects college kids to all be wild, unhinged, borderline alcoholics.  Thats how they justify their near every day drinking, and they can never just have a couple its always about getting drunk.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, but I just needed to vent.",

Anyways, there was one guy who insisted on waiting until I was finished with my combo. There is no battle phase on my turn one, so after performing actions, I'd ask if he has a response and he'd say no. Ok, my board is set and I end on Bow Wow and one Prank Kid. He allows me to set backrow. I declare End Phase and he says he Nibs me at the end of my Main Phase. Can he do that, I gave him several chances within the main phase even after I completed my combo? The game ended up coming to a draw due to time and I feel like that Nib impacted the game more than it should've. I could also just be dumb, bust some clarification would be nice anyways.",

I've also seen examples of more extravagant craft, with long term thermal energy conversion generators, fully encrypted communication suites, ECM, small arms lockers, hazard suits, shields/armor, fabricators, and other equipment to the point of being like small colony ships to eke out a living on a nearby world until eventual rescue.

    "So, I just wanted to make a little post about the condition of atheists and how it's like being one in this country. First of all, it's quite disheartening to see that literally most of your country's population loathes you for your opinions and lack of belief in religion. In most social media groups of our country atheists are seen as outcasts. Most of us here are closeted atheists since there's a pretty massive chance that our families won't take this matter well. Moreover, there have been a number of brutal murders of atheists whose \"fault\" was expressing their opinions, which lead to their demise. In my opinion, freedom of speech doesn't exist here and it's despairing being in a country where you can be murdered for your opinions.",

Então tipo, eu falei pra ela, que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas direito, a gente tem a necessidade de comer um doce de vez em quando. Aí ela ficou puta, começou falar que eu preferia os doces do que os amigos, e na real, pra mim os dois caminham lado a lado na vida. Se eu não como doce eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho amigos, eu me sinto sozinho, o que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money.

    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.

    "Reading a translation of Anabasis, I noticed that having escaped the Army of Artaxerxes, and made it through the Armenian mountain passes, the Ten Thousand encounter a reoccurring trope amongst the various Pontic peoples they encounter. There are multiple instances where the local villages flee their homes in the face of the oncoming army, and hole up in Strongholds/Citadels. From the book, it is my understanding that these are not populated settlements and are only occupied to wait out hostile forces. It also seems that they were built collectively between multiple villages rather than each village having its own small strong-point. What other sources, if any, reference this practice? Is there any evidence for these small strongholds? In the book, they are often taken by the greeks without a prolonged siege or any equipment so how sophisticated could they have been?",

    "I think that Isayama is an incredible writer, the manga as a whole is proof of that. But a lot of people have problems with this final arc, namely that a lot of characters get plot armor. I think this is because Isayama made Eren and the founding Titan way too overpowered. With how powerful Eren is, of course there's going to be some plot armor for those who oppose him. Like why can't he just use paths to stop every single person who opposes him in his tracks? The only logical explanation could be that he didn't want to, which I guess we will find out in 139. Still, I just really feel that Isayama made the FT too super powerful, and then of course still had to make a compelling final conflict so he had to nerf Eren in some way and give the Alliance some plot armor moments. I think if he had maybe written the Founding Titan to not be as powerful as it is this final conflict would be much better. I'd love some opinions",

When I was working out then I followed a 40/30/30 macro split on the SAD diet anyways I did achieve solid results only speaking on my physique aesthetically real nutrition was definitely lacking. Anyways I stopped working out a little over 2 years ago however 4 months after I stopped lifting I discovered the wfpb diet and have never looked back since. So currently since I’ve eaten right I have been able to maintain a low body fat also my job is physical so I do lift and I’m active physically from that. So I have a solid starting base I’m currently skinny with some muscle not a lot but there is some anyways I want to put on 5 to 10 pounds at the max without getting fat if possible I would like to stay lean. What would be the best way to go about this with a wfpb way of eating. Any help would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance guys.",

Doğa ana dedikleri şey budur belki de?",
    "It’s just something I’ve been thinking about recently. I’m currently a high school student and I feel like people glamorize not sleeping. Like, you’ll always see people talking about how they only got three hours of sleep, like is that supposed to be impressive? Is that supposed to be a good thing? You do realize you’re just telling people you can’t take care of yourself, right? I’ve even seen people get made fun of for sleeping the Recommended 8 hours. Personally I’m more impressed when somebody is able to get all their school work done AND maintain a balanced sleep schedule I have a lot of respect for those people. Is this just a thing at my school or it universal? I’ve seen this happening since like, 5th grade lol",
    "This is like day 5 and i woke up this morning with like no withdrawal symptoms and no cravings. I basically just took supplements, drank a lot of water and coffee, and smoked weed at night. Honestly i think the supplements are what helped the most I strongly encourage who ever is quitting to take ashwagandha, Htp-5, and Rhodiola Rosea Extract two of each twice a day. Its been giving me the biggest boosts of serotonin and as i did feel the withdrawal symptoms this dramatically reduced them. I’m telling you if you are struggling take these and you will feel soo much better. And also smoke weed or take CBD if you like, it kinda takes the edge off. But i like these supplements so much I’ll probably take them for a long time",
    "Missing 411 cases fascinate me in part because they really come closest to feeling like the closest real-life analogue to a Cthulhu-esque horror. In the Cthulhu books, these types of beings were portrayed as completely alien and unfathomable, like there is no way to understand their intentions or desires, they are just on another level entirely. They are also irresistibly powerful, mere humans have no hope of overpowering them or defeating them. In Missing 411 cases, we have no idea why this is done to people and what they get out of it, but there is a clear intelligence to which victims are taken, when they are taken, and how they are taken. Also, the entity responsible seems to have no constraints, taking people even from crowded areas and always being able to avoid being witnessed by other people or even security cameras. The implications of this phenomena are utterly terrifying and fascinating.",
    "I have a notes folder in my phone full of story ideas, most of them never get started but when they do they are so brief I don't know where to go with them. For example, I want to write a love story about two almost opposite girls who unexpectedly find themselves within each other in a small rural area. I want to guide the two through the trials and tribulations of being LGBTQ+ in a small school/place that isn't accepting. They will be together in secret, but people will eventually find out. I also want to make the story about them, and how they find each other and their story. I just don't know where to start. Right now I have about 600 words but I'm unhappy with it, It doesn't make much sense.",
    "i am extremely new to this game and decided to look up some guides on who should i play as a beginner and what you had to do in the game, i came across jungling which i found very appealing and wanted to try out and i buy master yi to begin because i saw in a video that he is a decent jungler and an overall easy character with a straightforward kit,  but i always no matter the amoount of guides on how to jungle or how to take less damage, i always find myself having extremly low health after doing just one camp or two and i sometimes even die when i try to do one more camp, so i need someone from here that has played the game before and has jungled before to give me a more in-deph explanation and strategies on what to do, thank you",
    "Hi guys, I drink them both coffee &amp; energy drinks on a daily basis but they never really get me hyped the way they work for others, I think I’ve just developed an addiction and thats why I drink them. I’ve never understood how people can get jittery and hyped from them. I used to think my tolerance was just high, because every day I’d have at least two cups of coffee, both with 6 shots of espresso and at least one big Monster / other energy drink and it would just make me yawn constantly &amp; I’d feel like I’m about to fall asleep. It does help me focus better but doesn’t do much energy wise, which sucks because I’m an athlete and I would love to have something to boost my trainings. Anyone else have that problem with caffeine? Any recommendations for what to drink instead? I talked to my doc and she said its common to get that reaction from caffeine but wouldn’t recommend me to consume anything that would make me more hyper and I get that, my mind is already running all the time but I have to train twice a day six times a week and my body could really use some sorta energy boost sometimes. Thanks guys, would love to hear about your experience with caffeine",
    "Were you ever afraid of the dark? Did your imagination conjure up a wide variety of potential threats that would have the added advantage of darkness as an ally? Remember covering your head with a blanket as though that would somehow provide an additional layer of protection no matter how minuscule. Maybe you could have just a little less fear by not knowing the assault was underway.  Remember how hollow your mother's words were when she said 'There's nothing to be afraid of'. When you were a little older, she then explained to you that the dark is just the absence of photons, remember how the fear just dissipated. What are we afraid of now? Death, oblivion, complete annihilation? How are these concepts different from nothing? Are you still afraid of nothing? Nothing is absolute. Are you still afraid of the absolute?

It's difficult to explain the full premise but there are about four cultures the player encounters that all have very exaggerated attributes of modern society that is supposed to get the player to question their own reality and recognize a lot of the strange and counterintuitive behaviors of humans. I need resources that relate to our lack of individuality, the limits of our perception, consumerism, mob mentality, how culture and upbringing shape our world view and opinions, and the negative emotions that cloud our judgement and beliefs.

    "I work at a fast food place running the fryer, and I used to work at one running the drive thru. The work is fast paced and bitter at times. People at the speaker have not only the whole menu, but the opportunity to ask questions about it to the employee at the register. Pulling up to the window and adding to your order messes up the flow for both the window worker and the cook. Now the people behind you have to wait longer while the cook drops extra food with no notice and the cashier has to ring you up again. You messed up the flow for the workers and you're making it inconvenient for other customers. And as we all know, annoyed or angry customers take it out on employees sometimes. Congratulations, your extra order of fries or your added sandwich makes it harder on everyone because you're indecisive. Fast food wage is not worth that nonsense, so please stop.",

The devs have only released small statements or have sent out bot sorry messages about the issue, there will be a one-off-mass restoration for the characters affected but when that will be no one knows. This restoration will only work if the gear they restore is exactly what we all had on before the wipes, just giving us random purples and golds will do all of us no good and will be like were still naked. At least cyberpunk was playable, and anthem only destroyed the system not the countless hours put into a save.

    "I’m serving in the military and the work cycle I have is staying in camp for a week and then having one week off. The country I live in requires all males to undergo mandatory military conscription for two years and I’m slightly more than one year into the military service. At this point I’m so sick of this mundane lifestyle in camp because I’m doing guard duty most of the time. I can sleep well at home during the one week off because I’m free from the military. However, every night before I have to enter the camp for work I just can’t fall asleep. I would only sleep for a maximum of four-five hours and on a bad night I don’t sleep at all. I have a few sleepless nights in camp as well. I do not know the exact reason what’s keeping me awake, but I suspect it’s because of the lack of enthusiasm I have for the military as it is just too boring. I’m only entering university next year so there’s absolutely no goalsto pursue during this period of time. I feel like I’m just wasting my life away now. I just want to sleep but I just hate my life in the military as there’s nothing to look forward to the next day and this keeps me from falling asleep.",

But the thing is, I'm a transguy, and it kind of makes me uncomfortable with how feminine it is. I don't really do stuffed animals, and recently attempted getting rid of an old pink cat squishmallow that I got from a friend a year or so back, and I told my ma about it the day before last, before I was given easter stuff. I mentioned that it was super girly, and was far too feminine for my liking and that I was going to try to give it to my SO. She mentioned that she had gotten me one, which had me backpedaling q u i c k. I feel super guilty about not being super fond of it, and don't get me wrong, it's adorable, and I truly appreciate the thought that went behind it, and she even mentioned it was pride themed due to the rainbows. But I realistically don't know what I'll do with it. I had my other one hidden, out if sight out of mind style, and these are kinda expensive. This one was $10 which may not seem like a lot, but it seems like a lot to me, and I know they could put that money to better use than having it sit in my closet.

    "Hey guys. I'm a second-year biochemistry major and I'm interested in pursuing pharmacology in grad school. However, I'm not sure if I'm taking the right path and would like some advice. Essentially, I switched from a BS in chemistry to biochemistry despite my fascination with organic synthesis. I did this because I believed understanding the chemistry of biological systems would be more beneficial in pursuing pharmacology in grad school. More than anything, I want to study psychedelic substances and how they affect the CNS, but I also would love to carry out the synthesis of psychoactive drugs in addition to studying their biomolecular mechanism of action. I want to do what Hamilton Morris does, and what Dr. David Nichols and Alexander Shulgin did. Did I make a mistake choosing biochem?

    "Recap: I fell like a rag doll on my foot and injured myself. Particularly I had a bruise on top and the sole of my foot that was very painful. My husband is a physician and agreed that my foot was fractured, but also agreed with redditors that it was a Lisfranc fracture and would need close observation. I cannot thank enough the kind advice about lisfranc fractures. The X-ray revealed it was indeed a Lisfranc fracture and would require casting to maintain immobility, as well as no weight bearing for many weeks. Unfortunately, because I have Axonal Charcot Marie Tooth, this was my good leg. So currently I am bed bound until I once again bear weight on this foot, if ever. Since my neurological decline has been so rapid, I am forced to remain immobile for the foreseeable future. Life just handed me all of the lemons at once like the world’s suckiest lottery prize. Overall though, I am stable and safe, so life could be worse. Thank you again for caring enough to offer your wonderful advice. I really appreciate it.",
    "Guys, I’m finally at 10 gpd down from 25-30. It’s taken a while but I’ve slowly tapered. However I feel like I’m stuck in limbo. 3 months ago 10 gpd would be unheard of for me and seemed like SUCH a small amount. Now that I’m here I realize that’s great and all, but I’m still taking 10 gpd. I want it to be less, I’m getting kind of fed up with how long this is taking, I’m not trying to take another 4 months to get off completely from 10 gpd. How did you guys feel when you were at 10? Am I close to the finish line? Not even close, still have a far ways to go? Anyone know how quickly I can be done by tapering ? I’m sure if I CT I would still experience WD, I feel it slightly each morning until I dose 1.5 grams. I’ve been using kratom for the past 6-7 years.",
    "Hi all. So I received an FX-8350 as a gift and I made an OK build with it. Though I made the absolute stupid mistake of using m5a78lm-usb 3 motherboard from ASUS which have horrible VRMS and therefore when using the 8350 with this motherboard, it throttles the performance as soon as it hits 60° or above 50% usage. I decided that I will save up to buy the Asus M5A97 EVO R2.0... should I buy a different motherboard coz I don't want to make the same mistake. Also, cause the 8350 is basically a room heater, I decided that I might spend extra on the thermal grizzly conductonaut. But then the product page says not to use this paste with aluminium heatsink. Does anyone know if the 8350 has an aluminium heatsink?. Thanks.",
    "I always thought of sweet water as a circle. It evaporates, it rains, it is absorbed and used...  somehow in this process it changes state of aggregation and location but is not necessarily reduced in quantity, or is it? I understand that there is some amount of sweet water that is polluted in a way it cannot be cleaned anymore. Are those significant amounts? Is the amount of sweet water at a world level actually decreasing in significant amounts? If yes, where does it go? When we are told to save water is it to prevent water from being \"wasted\" because by using it somehow we decrease the amount of times it can be reused or for other reasons? Which ones? Or is there actually enough sweet water on a world scale and it is a allocation problem and not one of quantity?",

It’s so lonely with no gf and when i realized I couldn’t get one involuntarily when I was 16 I knew then thati would have a hard time.

I do notice sometimes that I get brief intense shooting itching sensations on my thighs and very mild itching and redness on my genitals, wondering if these are just very mild outbreaks or psychosomatic symptoms. My doctors insist that outbreaks are obvious but I’ve seen in some studies that “asymptomatic”carriers just don’t realize when they’re having outbreaks. Anyone else have mild outbreaks or am I trippin? Tempted to get a swab to see if I’m shedding but there aren’t any blisters or bumps. I wish there were at home swab tests so I could do it regularly and get an idea of how often I shed, my partner is negative so far but now that I know my results I’ve been feeling guilty.",

    "Why do girls and women ever post there? Almost all comments are sexual or creepy/pervy, or just mean. Not funny. So many also get a ton of unpleasant, at best, PMS. Why do we do this? Seriously. Guys will humiliate and be mean but why do girls and women subject themselves to this? Not blaming the girls/women but most posts end up with the same types of comments from misogynistic people. The guys posting there get funny comments and are not met with uncreative, mean insults. Especially when conventionally \"pretty\" girls or women post the comments are so much meaner. Dear girls and women please reconsider. Also I have a feeling that the amount of porn these boys and men watch make it impossible to see a photo of a girl/woman and not sexualize it.",
    "I don’t know how exactly to explain this, but when I was little, I used to get these breathing “bursts.” What I mean by that is there were times when I would breath in as if to take a deep breath, but instead of a normal deep breath it felt like I was breathing in happiness. Bare with me I know this sounds crazy. This was a feeling of all over calming, clean, comforting, burst of I don’t know what to call it. It would happen at different times like while was playing or other random times. It would happen maybe a couple of times a week from what I remember. All I know is that it happened regularly throughout my childhood but stopped sometime before my teen years. I’ve never felt it again. I think of this from time to time and wonder if maybe it was some sort of spiritual experience. I really don’t know but I’ve never met anyone else who has experienced this. Any thoughts? Any similar experiences???",
    "I'm late to it, but I just watched Netflix's I Am a Killer: Released. Basically, Dale Sigler did 30 years for shooting Subway employee John William Zeltner Jr to death during a robbery. He has been paroled, and now repeatedly asserts that he did it because John \"tried to blackmail him into having a homosexual relationship \", although nothing like that was presented at trial.Afterwards,  I searched posts about it to read about posters wanting to empathize or questioning if they should pity Dale. I had the exact opposite reaction. I was totally disgusted by his repeated use of homophobic sentiment to reframe himself as a victim. I get the impression he's using religion as something to create a new facade for himself. He clearly doesn't take responsibility for what he did, and when he speaks, it's as if some important piece of humanity is missing behind his eyes. I also noticed Albino Legend,, a white supremacy tattoo, on his hands.I realize much of my reaction was based on personal impressions. I do believe in second chances, but frankly,  I found it shocking how quickly this community seems to embrace him. He's taken in by a complete stranger and parishioners nod encouragingly when he tells his new reason for the killing. I'd have great trepidation about this person reoffending.

    "When anyone tries to get you to discount your internal truth in favor of what they’re trying to convince you is true, you can either betray yourself or honor yourself. No abuser ever tells their victims, “I’m here to abuse you.” Instead, they always try to win the trust of their victims by convincing them that what they’re trying to do to them is in their best interest. Socialists are abusers. Period. 100% of examples throughout history validate this. That ain’t gonna change no matter how much you like AOC’s underdog story.  Social media and big tech are trying to deceive you into being abused and believing it’s in your best interest because they care. I don’t know about you, but I choose to see it for what it is.

    "I realised today that we never actually got the love we deserved from our parents. I used to convince myself that “they weren’t that bad” and the love bombing stages made me think it was just “normal fighting” but it’s not. I grew up bullied as well and so neither school or home was my safe space which was the reason I read so much and threw myself into fictional worlds. Maladaptive daydreaming was my escape. It’s only recently that I have a healthy bunch of friends that I can say they’re my safe space especially since I still live with my parents but it’s a punch in the gut to think the people who are supposed to give you that unconditional healthy love that you can rely on and always come home to gave us the kind of love we have to spend the rest of our lives trying to unlearn and escape From. It’s incredibly damaging because then we tend to seek that healthy love in our romantic relationships and friendships to make up for what we never got as kids. We’re not supposed to seek it out like that it was supposed to been given to us by our parents but they never did. It’s hard to admit being unloved but that’s what it is.",

Like I know they probably explain later on in the story but I just can't even be bothered, second, why tf would they skip so much? They should of made a direct sequel to wolfenstein 2, why did they think skipping like 20 years was good? Wheres all the characters I know and love? And to be calling this Canon? Ruins everything, why is it online? Has no one learned from fallout 76? You cant take a beloved series and then make a online game, maybe if it was a spin off game I could maybe tolerate it, atleast with fallout 76 I can tolerate it, but not this, this is a mistake, I could care less about, what was there names? Soph and jess? I think? I just want to keep fighting the nazi's and expand the rebellion and kick ass as BJ, it's just so sad, I love wolfenstein TNO and 2 and when you take away the main character along with the people I actually care about, you ruin the game series, it makes me sad because I know truly believe that they cannot fix this, if I had a time machine I would go back in time and stop them from making a wolfenstein game 20 years or whatever in the future from the last game, what are your thoughts on this horrible game?",

    "I ordered the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G 512 GB in color Phantom Black originally back on March 2, 2021 from AT&amp;T. I finally received it on April 8 2021. I waited a very long time to get this particular model and I only found out about a delay because of chip shortages from Reddit. First of all to even remove the expandable memory slot and then have customers have to wait a lengthy amount of time for their order because they choose the 512GB version is insane. My cellphone carrier kept saying it was coming... it will be there in a couple of days etc. for the entire time. I told myself once I get it I will post it on Reddit  just so maybe I can end some frustration for anyone else waiting for their order.  The one good thing that I can say however is that I love this phone. It did not disappoint. I had used the Samsung Galaxy Note phones for at least 6 or 7 years. It was hard to get me away from the Note versions, had my Samsung Note 9 for the a little over 2 years. I had a lot of wear and tear on my phone so I did a lot if research to narrow down my next cellphone purchase choice. I am so glad I decided to get a different version this time. Samsung cellphones are my go to brand and will continue to be in the future. The Samsung Galaxy Ultra 5G phone is a definite winner. So many pros and a few cons but the features and specs are remarkable so I will no doubt recommend this brand to anyone who wants to purchase a new cellphone in the near future.",

I’ve only been here since the beginning of February but honestly the shitty scheduling and lack of work/life balance no matter how many times I bring up how I need less hours because I’m in school is just too much. I also have not felt like my store is a “safe space” for me, as I’m visibly not straight or cisgender and my coworkers as well as customers have been clocking me for it or talk about me behind my back and it’s really wearing me down and makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. I’d like to quit and preferably not have to physically hand a notice in or stay a full two weeks.

About a year ago, I got the urge to recover so we started grocery shopping together and eating our meals together. However, I relapsed shortly after and I’ve been restricting every day again. And though she’s never had issues with her eating patterns before, she’s now restricting with me. I never see her eating unless I’m eating too and if she says she’s hungry but I choose not to eat, she will change her mind as well. She’s also been working out more frequently and mentioning how much weight she’s losing. It’s added a ridiculous new amount of pressure on me because I feel like I’m being forced to recover in order to prevent her from getting sick. Does anyone relate??",

    "I’ve been listening to kpop for 3 years now and I never really watched kdramas up until last year well technically I have but only seen 3. The first one I watched was in 2019 and I never finished it and then I watched and finished two in 2020. My friend and everyone on the internet talks about the latest dramas some popular ones I’ve heard of is “what’s wrong with secretary kim” and “crash landing on you.” I guess when I got into kpop I was mainly focused on kpop so I never took the time to actually watch kdramas and I still don’t  to this day. I’ve seen stuff about how some people like for dramas to take their time with the plot and that it catches them off guard when things move to fast. And I feel like that’s why I don’t watch them because I get bored easily and if it takes to long to get to the point I’m not gonna finish it.

    "Honestly people who are gay Christians need to stop going through loop holes to try to not make homosexuality a sin in Christianity. The Bible has about six passages in which it can be taken as condemning homosexuality. I’m not arguing that Christians should attack gay people but I believe not calling it a sin in the Bible is off at best and disingenuous at worst. EVERY single verse is a mistranslation or has an alternative reasoning? And even if that was true most of the early church didn’t agree homosexuality wasn’t sinful. I think a better way to think is “the Bible says this but I still believe in God” or “I don’t care if being gay is a sin but I’m still a Christian” but throwing shotty reasoning isn’t doing you or anybody else any justice.",

    "I have been looking for RAM for MONTHS. I ordered some back in January and it is still backordered and my attempts to find some elsewhere have turned up empty.

I initially found some for around $140 a stick but while it has been on backorder the price has gone up $50 and the site doesn't lock in your price. So it will cost me $200 more than planned. I have on occasion found some RAM but only at $200+ a stick. I don't specifically need that model of RAM.

    "For a little over a month now, I’ve had these pressure/headaches on the left side of my head only. The pressure moves. Sometimes it is below my eye, sometimes in my upper jaw/cheek, sometimes below my eyebrow, on my eyebrow, temple, behind the ear, above the ear, and on the side of my head. When it first started, I saw my doctor and he said he saw fluid in my ear, which meant infection, and gave me an antibiotic. It didn’t help. He said it is allergy related and told me to take allergy meds, so I’ve also been doing a nasal spray and allergy med every day. Allegra until I ran out, now just an Amazon generic 10 mg. I went back, and he ordered a CT scan. He said CT scan showed “thickening” of the sinuses behind my eye and prescribed Amitriptyline, which has done nothing but make my heart race. I can’t even find anything online about that med and sinuses. This has been more than a month, the pain isn’t more than a 2-4 on the pain scale, but it’s exhausting. The only other allergy symptoms I have are drainage and sneezing. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to relieve it if so?",
    "every aspect of my life is determined by what other people want and how i can make them happy. i have terrible social anxiety so to compensate for it i focused on trying to do everything i could to not make other people uncomfortable, but i feel like i'm overly aware of it. i can't talk to people because i worry i might make them uncomfortable by it, even my closest friend. i can't make decisions because i don't want to upset or inconvenience other people because of it. hell i'm only still alive because other people would be upset. what's the point of living if it's entirely for others? people say \"think of the things that make you happy\", but i just can't pinpoint what legitimately makes me happy versus hobbies i adopted for other people. i live for a validation i have never and will never receive, and i fucking hate it.",
    "My mom found out of my eating disorder on my birthday in November and she then told my whole family, which embarrassed me. I've been struggling with bulimia since I was a pre-teen and before that, I had stopped eating and lost a lot of weight. But my whole family is insensitive to my feelings and I have to lie and say that I'm getting better. When I'm sad, my mom keeps telling me that I'm trying to be depressed, which is very insensitive. She thinks that it's easy to recover from something so traumatic for me. She also says that if she sends me to counseling or therapy, I'll have to eat 2000 calories per day. so I was wondering how therapy is because the last two years, I've never felt so low before. Thank you and have a nice day.",
    "So I went to elementary school and middle school in this one school district and I found it easy to make friends and I was always the top of my grade, the classes feeling super easy. But for high school my parents made me switch to another school district as their high school was one of the best in the state with lots of resources. The thing is, I would say I’m doing pretty well but the culture there is so that everyone tries so hard and it feels like everyone that I know has started their own club or community service while ranking highly in other clubs and sports and on top of that about 20 aps at the end of their senior year. I searched this up and apparently you are heavily compared to people at your high school. Right now I would say I’m on track to do the many aps but not much community service/clubs or anything to make me stand out. I know at my last school district this would already be super impressive and now that I’m already going to be a Junior I feel very lost and worried that I might’ve made a life changing mistake by switching schools. I still have friends from my last school district and O hear so many people getting into great schools with such little effort while I’m busting my butt off with like full aps and not even able to stand out because I don’t have the work ethic to go even further than that.",
    "So don't tell me where I heard it. It's a looooong story, kinda like a mystery. The Developer is coming back soon, and there's going to a massive update, some patches, and huge improvements to the main server. He's the one who is the mod of the multiverse, but he stepped down for a bit cuz one of his AI's said they could do a better job. The the current gameplay was kind of a troubleshooting phase, so that's what dark energy and dark matter is about. Anyways, you wouldn't understand the whole story even if I explained it to you. But don't worry, the patch will come with hidden lore, new abilities, a variety of experiences, etc. Get ready, this is going to be big. Bu the way. The Developer's wife has been conducting a survey. I swear they don't want you to buy anything, just do whatever the hell you want and respect one another, and don't fking troll. It gets annoying.",
    "I purchased Nordick track x32i, almost a 4K Machine, with $199 Shipping costs. The shipping team insisted they have to place the treadmill in the garage, citing COVID reasons. We had to lift heavy equipment and assemble it ourselves even though we paid hefty price for shipping. The screen and everything turned on after we assembled it in our first floor, but the belt doesn't run no matter what speed is selected. I reached out to the customer service with in a week of delivery and they were not helpful at all. They pretended they did not understand which seems to be a common problem with the treadmill and try to find excuses not to address the faulty machine. They went to extent of making me send pics of where the machine was set up claiming they won't cover it if its still in the garage, to begin with they insisted to place it there. Fortunately we had no room in the garage and we had to set up in our recreation room. I sent the pictures with a fraction of second and they disappeared on me. What kind of service is this? They start conversation with anything they can do to escape servicing you. Dont' they run tests on machines that are being delivered? Anyone with terrible experience as me?",
    "Hello folks - I am 43 with an MBA and am a Program Manager. I make a very good income but would like to slowly get to a point where I could pursue early retirement at 50. My definition of early retirement is to have flexibility in pursuing my interests. I am open to choosing a second career where I have this flexibility. I have an undergraduate degree in Engineering. I love building things. As examples I installed recessed lighting in my home, built my own theater in my home, build a backyard playset for my kids. I am wondering if pursuing something like HVAC technician or electrician or plumbing on the side can help proper a second career. Can someone advise what are meaningful second career opportunities to pursue?",

If they make the alberto slower than that thing they're moronic to the highest degree and if they make magy stronger than it should be and faster than it should be they're also moronic as that would be conceptually ridiculous, I said the devs should've had the foresight to see magys biggest problems but with a name like Afterthoughts I take that back as they're really living up to that name, fact is it should've been replace by Amargasaurus or Shunosaurus.",
    "Apologizes for all my recent posts to this sub lately. Found out today that I failed AUD with a 71. On test day I woke up feeling extremely foggy and mentally unfocused, and I feel like this is a large reason why I failed. The testing centers near me have openings next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, so I’m heavily contemplating retaking the exam next week. Would studying full time between now and next Wednesday/Thursday be enough for a pass? Not sure if I should put my all into studying for the next 6-7 days and try to schedule a retake next week, or if I should take my time and schedule it for a few weeks out. I feel like all of the information is still very fresh in my mind, which is why I kind of have this need to take it immediately. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "I’ve had unexplained severe abdominal pains that have landed me in emergency 3 times. They are so bad so chronic and severe that I’ve ended up on oxycodone and pregabalin for pain. I know it sounds crazy but in the search for answers I discovered a slipped disc and got the neurosurgeon to prescribe me dihydrocodeine as I’d previously used codeine paracetamol I had lying in the house from another family member. I’m doing a stool test with a naturopath on Monday that tests for everything including SIBO SIFO And H.Pylori . My question is has anyone had abdominal pains that are cruel and torture me to death. With the continuing feeling that I have a fart or BM to pass, have had this feeling 24/7 for 8 months and it’s torturing. Even the pain killers don’t help as much anymore.",
    "We call ourselves the generation of change, but I feel like we are a scam. We are meant to be the generation which shows the others how to be respectable people, but how the hell are we meant to be the “superior” generation if you are making fun over a recently deceased man? Prince Phillip created the wwf for gods sake, which last I checked is a charity trying to prevent animals becoming extinct. He was a man who fought for change in the past which shaped our present, and frankly without him, we wouldn’t be where we are today. I know he isn’t perfect, by any means, and it is inevitable somebody will comment about how he was, but 10 minutes after it was announced he died, a tonne of memes came out. I’m ashamed over how fast the memes are, and the fact that people are there saying “thank god he is dead” clearly have no respect. Most of the memes I’ve seen are from gen z, and it makes me ashamed to be a part of this generation.",

I called him hitler, and he replied with “hitler was a republican, I am a democrat is side with the left”. Hitler. Republican. Excuse me? But it doesn’t end there, ladies and gentlemen, I respond with “hitler was a nazi”. He says that anyone who apposes the left is a nazi so that makes him the same as a republican. I said that not everyone who apposes him is a nazi, and he replied with “that’s why we need to imprison everyone who disagrees with the left first because they are the violent ones who want to kill us.” What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People? Better watch out, this guy is gonna run for president and imprison every “nazi” so that it is only pure people with his beliefs. And it’s not only the fact that he was calling everyone a nazi, it was the fact that the dude was saying he was gonna do exactly why hitler did.

    "Hi, I am a female in college and the last relationship that I was in he constantly struggled to stay hard during sex. He said it was because he was always nervous around me or had been drinking too much and I believed him then, but now I have hooked up with quite a few people since then and more than half of them have also had this problem with me. They either cannot finish at all or I have to give them a BJ for them to stay erect. Is there something I could consistently be doing wrong? I always ask when this happens if there's something they want me to do differently, but I am always reassured that it isn't me, but its happened too many time for me to believe that now haha. Is this problem more common than I thought with guys in their early 20's? Or is there something girls do during sex that would cause this to happen that I could possibly be doing?",

    "So it takes a good 30 minutes or so to get a decent base up and supply it with resources, it takes a bastion 1 minute to fly over it and destroy it in a quick drive by shooting. Whats the point anymore? Add in the rapidly rotating continents where alerts are triggered within the first 30 minutes of a continent opening these days, putting effort into creating a nice base feels like a total wasted effort. The whole system could be so much better with some changes. Some sort of system that adds persistence to bases after continent lock would be nice for example, the game really could use some form of persistence like that, as it stands now its just a never ending cycle of continent locks and alerts with no real long term meaning. The durability of bases could really use some balance changes as well, its just too ridiculously easy to destroy them compared to the time investment required to set a nice one up.",

I drive the speed limit at all times no matter what because I'm neurotic and cannot afford to get pulled over and have my car insurance increase. So obviously people pass me constantly. Almost every car that ends up behind me. I'm not stupid so I've inferred that people don't drive the speed limit so I should be at traffics speed, and I must be annoying. Sorry to anyone that I've inconvenienced. I just don't understand the point of having posted speed limits that no one follows yet you can still legally get pulled over and ticketed for not following them. I'm genuinely confused if this is an unspoken rule that everyone understands and I'm just not in the loop. Why do we need to go so fast anyway? What's the rush guys???",

That's why I thought that I could take AP stats over the summer of Junior year at Johns Hopkins CTY to give me one more course. However, I realized that I'm also gonna be pretty busy this year with writing my essays and retaking my SAT, but at the same time, another AP might help, I don't know for sure.

    "Available for the first time on vinyl is the complete OLYMPIA THEATRE, PARIS, FRANCE 5/3/72 show from the Grateful Dead’s legendary Europe ‘72 Tour. Of the twenty-two performances on the famed Europe '72 tour, the first night in Paris on 5/3/72 has always been considered one of the best. This is proven by the fact that four songs from this concert were included on the seventeen-track, seminal platinum-selling Europe '72 album. The performance also includes five songs sung by Pigpen on what would be his final tour, including a massive “Good Lovin',” which allows Pigpen to do what he does best: hold the audience in the palm of his hand while they hang on his every word.

Seriously. I am currently all in on AMC, but just today I was thinking of buying some GME. I truly believe and have seen exceptional DD that GME is gonna run up really fucking high. I think that big price jump in January was  not the actual squeeze but an artificially inflated price to get people to sell. And it worked. Just my opinion. Not financial advice. You can’t go wrong either way. Just read a bit more because GME may just be further along than AMC and very well could pull the truly big numbers sooner.",

I tend to work 2-3 months at a time and take a month or two to live off my savings and unemployment before going back to work to re up on money.

Now it doesn't really bother me if they have a handful of clothes that's fine, but if they just toss a whole pile of clothes and don't sort them or anything, it just gets on my nerves. Do they not realize how long it's gonna take to remove like 30 fucking hangers, and that it's literally holding up EVERYONE ELSE in line???? What makes it worse is that people usually put their clothes up last, so as I'm scanning everything else, they have time to at least take SOME hangers off instead of just dropping a big pile on me. Shout-outs to the customers who actually remove the hangers beforehand or before I start scanning them, it genuinely saves me so much time",

It would be fun to see the convoy stop at monuments and have a squad of scientist disembark as well as one manning the 50 on the M-ATV and having players assault it. Even cooler would be the ability to ambush the convoy with HV rockets and land mines to get a one up on the Scientist. It would be interesting to see what new gameplay this would create as you would have an event constantly roaming around the map unlike the Bradley at Launch every encounter with this convoy will be different",
    "As i watched the show, i began to notice something very unique that this show has that not too many other do. It has amazing writing and character development. I just LIVE how it isnt focused on a single main character, the show tends to branch out and give each character at least 1 amazing and impactful story of their own. Admittedly, the first season was mainly centered around Q, but the rest of the seasons were perfectly and beautifully spread out between the characters, allowing for amazing development and backstory growth for each one. And not only do they give each character their own amazing story, but they blend them all in together soooo well. For the writing, i just gotta say one thing: Margo. I cant tell you how many times i laughed at some of the things she has said. This show is a perfect example of how shows should be.

    "Hi guys and gals. I was doing my morning meditation and at the end of it a thought popped into my head \"why did it take me so long to quit kratom despite the nightmare i was living in daily?\". I used for 2 years everyday, 10-30gpd...sometimes more. I came to the conclusion that i was so use to feeling like absolute shit after taking kratom that i became subconsciously attached to that world because it was all i knew. If you're \"afraid\" to quit...don't be. Why? Because kratom already makes you feel like absolute shit....otherwise you wouldn't be on this sub wanting to quit. Will the withdrawals and paws be worse than how you feel now? It's a matter of how you perceive it. Here's the thing...you know exactly what taking kratom leads you to....more and more and more....it's never enough. Like a monster that needs to be constantly fed. All the while you still feel like shit. Here's the thing that quitting it leads you to....getting your life back, feeling emotions besides fear and anxiety again, your physical and mental health returning, your joy, compassion, gratitude, and happiness. Is everything perfect and peachy after you quit....of course not. But the days you are feeling like shit, you can step back and know at least the next hour, week, month, or year could be different than how you feel after ingesting that green sludge. How bad do you want your life back? Is it worth a few weeks of feeling like shit compared to years? You know the answer. You're not alone. Stay strong...and if you need to reach out REACH OUT. I'll do anything i can to help",
    "Hi. I want help if anyone can spare a few words of encouragement. I wrote religious on the topic of this because I am kind of a religious. I grew up catholic and I don’t follow the church a lot but I do have faith. I’ve posted her before about how my dad treats me. I’m the oldest daughter and I feel like my mom and I are used as the scapegoat to why everything is horrible for my dad. Anyway, I feel alone a lot. I pray and I feel like no one is listening. Does anyone have some scripture or words of encouragement from the Bible? I sometimes feel like I am the one in the wrong because my dad uses God and my faith against me. Anything would be great. I am going to get a keepsake with the Virgin Mary on it to keep me safe and to remind myself she is there with me. Anyway, thank you to this group. It makes me feel less alone.",
    "Have these positions been eliminated in all Lowe's stores? I was hired as a Pro Electrical associate that included a higher quarterly bonus structure than regular floor associates get. I was informed at the end of last year that the Pro-Electrical and Pro- Plumbing positions have been eliminated and that my bonus would be reduced by quite a bit. This is a demotion that I did nothing to deserve. It is a reduction in my yearly compensation for the work I do. In the meantime, I am still doing all of the things for Pro Services that I had previously done, so the only difference in my work requirements is that I no longer have access to some of the abilities to control stock inventory as I used to. Just wondering if this was a store management decision or a corporate one.",
    "Can we all as a collective agree that huge maps ~~are bad~~ with only 1 area of interest are bad. The way their design is lacking. With only 1 point of interest if you don't get the good spawns for them then you your shit out off luck. Have fun clearing resort with gigga chads camping dark corners, and the infamous potted rats and don't get me started on woods oh god woods. If shoreline ever gets a face lift like customs just add more then just 1 area of interest and have future maps have more focus on form over function. Maybe add beach houses and touristy spots or maybe since we have a power station why not pair it with a water treatment plant with offices, a parking lot, and big silos. I'm not a game designer but this ain't it.",
    "We were talking about someone who was using substance abuse and I was shattered due to it and lost a night of sleep and was about to go into depression for a week. My therapist just calmly asked how my weekend was as usual, and I told it was not that great and he asked if I wanted to talk about it.. I just kept quiet and uttered, why don't you ask.. he closed everything and just quietly asked \"What happened that made you feel this way?\" And I instantly opened up and told it hurt me and I know it shouldn't have because my life is more important and I was learning in therapy how to become a better person. He just asked \"Are you sad about it?\" And I replied..\"not sad, disappointed, I don't want people to go down a bad path and others don't even understand it's not okay and support it and I always be the odd one out\". He just replied saying \"shouldn't\" is a strong word you used, it's fine to feel that way, you should take your time. He was like \"Trust me, you're just 21 now, by the time you're 27, you'll be the one who will have her life under control whereas they'd not and I that's because you understand well\". He also told me I don't fit it or isolate myself because I understand people too well and people mostly don't like it. I just perked up and told, \"So what? I love being this way\" and he was like yeah, that's important. The fact that we both understand each other so well makes me so happy that I can just sit and talk to him and forget that he's my therapist and just someone who I am comfortable with.",
    "We've all seen it time and time again.  Someone goes through a life saving medical procedure, or is rescued by brave EMS from harrowing situations, and their reaction once they recover is to thank God for working his magic and saving their life.  Advancements in medicine that helps struggling third world countries is \"God's work\".  He uses the hands of doctors and scientists to provide for his flock.  But now, in 2021, while going through the worst global pandemic in a hundred years, a vaccine comes out and Christians everywhere are fighting tooth and nail to demonize it.  What happened to \"God works in mysterious ways\"?  Sorry if this has been said a million times on this sub already, but I've recently been pleading with some family members to get vaccinated, and while they aren't specifically citing their religion for the reason behind it, it definitely seems to be stemming from their church.  Why are they now abandoning their blanket attributions of science to God.  We all know why, it's just crazy to me that they so easily forget their own logic.",
    "Let me start by saying I like oppressors. They’re fun, fun to use and to fight against.  I played this game when it came out, and took a hiatus for a few years, came back on ps4 in 2017 and there was a bunch of new stuff I didn’t care to grind up at the time.. I’ve been playing again for a few months and am working towards having all the shiny toys, my newest one being a khanjali I fully upgraded thinking it would be a decent swatter for the oppressors in an open lobby.. the aiming radius sucks and less than ten rockets kills the damn thing, I’m a little bummed out but not too discouraged. On foot I usually goad those guys into tight covered spaces and headshot them. Just wondering if any of you fine folks have any ground fighting tactics against oppressors you want to share",
    "Currently stuck on the glass bead milestone hard, from what I understand you need to find around 8 submerged ruins before you get given the horrific treasure. On my last play session I managed to get like 5 submerged ruins back to back via scanning with the nautilon but now for the past 10-15 oceans, on over 10 planets I havent been able to find a single one. Just an unlucky 3 hour dry streak? Or is there something im not getting. Because from what ive seen, the scanner radius is huge, some of the ruins it found for me were over 8 minutes of travel time away and im finding it hard to believe im simply not in range to locate any. Extremely frustrating as its one of the last milestones I need and I cant really find any information on it, or submerged ruins at all on youtube or the wiki, and my only option is just a crapshoot at landing on a random planets ocean, constructing a nautilon bay, scanning, finding absolutely nothing, rinse and repeat.",
    "We married young. Had a baby young. Both needed to do some major growing up. Played the back and forth game for years. Finally decided enough was enough. He left mine and our daughters lives. I have always said he's my soul mate. No doubt about it. But he had a drinking problem and needed to grow up. After years of looking for qualities he had in other men. I finally gave up and settled for a man who seemed to love me and my daughter We got pregnant less than 6 months into our relationship. We kept trying and eventually got married. My oldest wanted the same last name and asked to be adopted. My ex-husband agreed to do what he thought his daughter wanted. Current husband turned out to be a liar and master manipulator. Good dad but bad for me. I started seeing a therapist and realized I never have let go of my ex-husband and all the things I wanted to say she said I needed to talk to him or write him a letter. So I did. We talked and we talked and we talked. We both realized we have never been truly happy since we split. He's finally grown up and regrets his mistakes but can't do anything to change them. He only wants to make up for them. So we are here. I'm separated from my current husband and so completely in love with my ex-husband that it's unreal how right it feels.",
    "I played three games of Control tonight. The first match was a neck and neck struggle. It was difficult, but my team pulled ahead and won. Afterwards, teams were broken up and made more “fair”. My next two games were up against a sweaty 4 stack that fucked us and mercy ruled us 97-33. However teams were not changed and I was stuck against the same 4 stack the next round, despite the matchup being anything but fair. How the hell does this happen? Lately almost every game I have played has been much more unbalanced, but when it is a fair game that doesn’t end with Shaxx pitying us, the matchmaking says “Fuck you” before throwing me into a awful sweat fest that make me regret even picking up the controller.",
    "I have to reread a book I hated . I read this book maybe 5 years ago and I don't remember the plot much but I do remember the main character's father and one of her sisters. The father is some noble guy who can't marry the Mc's mother because she is a lower class ,so instead he never married her or found a solution and just became husband and wife in everything but name. He is a general / commander and when his friend/ leader died  they do this tradition where they cannot eat or drink anything but bread or water for a week I think. He forces his pregnant \"wife\" to do this tradition even though the tradition usually allows  pregnant people to  skip it.  Her youngest  sister has a club foot too.  Something happens in the book where ,he decides to leave his family to officially marry someone else and this is a character defining moment for the MC since her father is a dick.",
    "I got a monstera clipping from a friend, potted it and put it next to my sliding glass door that got several hours of bright sunlight. I had it there for about a year and not much happened. It grew 1 or 2 new leaves that stayed really small. I moved it outside where it got about 3 or 4 hours of direct sun a day. It grew super fast and got really big. I recently moved to a new place where there’s no room for it inside so I kept it outside. However now it gets direct sunlight almost all day. Everything I read about monsteras is that they will burn in direct sun, so I’m worried about summer coming and having almost no shade. Does anyone else have a monstera that loves direct sun? Or am I about to kill my plant?",

    "Our friend accidentally caught an adult Banded Water Snake while fishing, and the poor snake got injured by the fish hook. We removed the hook from the snake’s side, and I handled the snake to make sure he was okay and calm. We did not have any iodine or the proper equipment to treat his wound, but thankfully the hook didn’t puncture any vital organs. I put him around my neck and shoulders while carrying him back down to the lake, and my friend took a photo of me with the snake around my neck, and then posted it on Facebook before we let the snake go. The comments on the Facebook post were ignorant and ridiculous. People were saying “he has a death wish. That’s a water moccasin.” Or “it looks fully evil”. First off, it was NOT a water moccasin. The snake had round pupils and was not aggressive, and I’m experienced enough to know what snake is what. I definitely would not free handle a venomous snake. Some people are idiots and should really get educated before trying to put their two cents in. The snake was completely harmless. I wanted to treat his wounds before letting him go back into the wild, but he swam away just fine.",

    "I came up with some good chorus lyrics for a song I want to write but my brain immediately created some stupid melody for them that isn't even good and now I can't break out of it. Every time I try and write some lyrics  my brain's goal is to conform to this rhythm and it's blocking me from being able to express myself. I found a better melody but that didn't help because now I can't break out of THAT one. I just want to write some words and THEN come up with the melody, but because I'm stuck in this one, I can't come up with any words. I tried writing it down as a poem instead of a song but still I just can't stop that melody and rhythm circling in my head. I tried playing some other melody and writing to that but that didn't work either. Any ideas? Lol",
    "Obviously Attila predates our modern understanding of \"conservative\" or \"right wing\" by thousands of years, but I'm still quite confused. As you may recall, last year, Kelly Loeffler ran a campaign ad in which she claimed to be \"more conservative then Attila the Hun.\" This confused me, as I'd never heard anything about Attila being particularly conservative; I also just read a Donald Trump quote from the 2000 election cycle, in which he said, \"I'm on the conservative side, but Buchanan is Attila the Hun.\" Hearing two comparisons of conservatives to Attila the Hun has just left me confused, so I came here to ask anyone who can answer: was Attila the Hun especially conservative? Enough so to warrant these hyperbolic comparisons?",

Apparently it's better to pot them in those biodegradable pots and leave them indoors until they grow about 6 inches then replant them. My problem with this is that I can't do it in my house and have to do it in a treehouse instead, there's a fair amount of light but not as much as a house window due to the tree cover, it has insulation and double glazed windows but the temperature still drops overnight.

    "My Xbox One S has been sent back to Microsoft in the past and was \"fixed\" but now the problems are even worse. Games flat out won't start, so pretty much every time I want to play a game I have to hard reset the console and wait to see if that worked, which it usually doesn't. If it does work then only a certain few games work and only if the console wants to let me play that day. It's totally random when the console wants to work so it usually just doesn't. If a game will even load it will eventually boot me back to the home screen and show an error message saying \"for some reason your game took too long to load\" and then I'll restart the process. Microsoft won't do anything other than suggest I try to send it in for repair which costs about $175 or just buy a new one since it's no longer under warranty.  I have literally tried every troubleshooting piece of advice Microsoft will give since I've called about 10 times. Thinking this may be internal hardware issue maybe?

    "So I’ve been pretty excited with all the Disney Villainous expansions that we have gotten and will get but I’m kinda curious if Ravensburger have future plans on doing Pixar Villainous. Since Disney owns Pixar I was thinking it would be really cool to see they’re take on how the Pixar Villains will win. Obviously I feel there’s a few Villains for I think would be really amazing to see. For example, Mister Waternoose from Monsters Inc. His goal could be literally be to scare Boo enough times to fill up a certain number of canisters with her screams, as well as having ally cards be Randal and other scare monsters from the floor. Also it would be cool to give Hopper from Bug’s Life a chance to throw down. As we known he’s main goal is to make the worker ants bring him enough food to survive the winter. It would be pretty cool to see how the circus troop play out against him in the game. Another villain that would be interesting to see from Pixar universe is AUTO from WALL-E. I love WALL-E and and nothing would scream crazy villain like an ai computer forcing the main kind to be lazy and to give up on returning back to earth. AUTO goal could be to obtain the plant and try to destroy it. Ideally there are many villains that could appear if they ever did a Pixar edition to of Disney Villainous, but will we ever see it come to fruition? Who would you think would be interesting to see from the Pixar world entering into the Villainous board game world?",

Then once I go to clean I am locked in focus, because if someone distracts me with a different task, like if my mom asks me to vacuum out the car while I’m getting ready to clean, I’ll have to vacuum at the car, then take another 15, 30 minutes scrolling through social media or something to re-excite myself and re-energize my brain before I go clean.

When she went for her second shot she was told her name wasn't in the system, but she had her vaccine card from her first appointment and they said they'll manually enter her second and all should be fine. Now when she searches the system on the app for proof of being vaccinated, it comes up empty. She has her paper vaccine card but she loses things easily and it would be best to have the pass on her phone. Anyone else have an issue with retrieving their pass? Or know of a solution?

    "I have to say, I haven’t ever gotten into reading quite like this, this series comes pretty close to my favorite book series Ready Player One, and might even overtake it. I just have never read a series with so much action in little romance, yet still incredibly wholesome. The last few months spent on the light novel have been absolutely amazing, and I’m so glad I decided to read past the current point in the manhwa. The side stories and after stories topped the story off perfectly, even though it left me feeling a little empty and lonely, those stories really enhance the main series and these stories wouldn’t be as good if the original story wasn’t so amazing. The author could really be criticized for the ending, but for me it made me feel so happy, even though I didn’t feel as fulfilled as I wanted to be. I just have to say, this light novel and even the art for the manhwa is just breathtaking. Absolutely breathtaking.",
    "I entered a casual relationship with a married couple. It was perfect I always wanted to hook up with a milf and the husband never minded I never bottomed or gave head. Eventually, they'd asked me to officially join their relationship. I was against it as they were old enough to be my parents, I'd have no security in the relationship, and the idea of committing to more than one person skeeves me out. I told them it was best to keep things casual. I'd later meet my girlfriend so I broke up with them. Things almost immediately went to shit. They both started harassing me. I got to the point where I had to inform my GF which meant I had to come out to her. I never intended on doing so since I would effectively be straight in our relationship. I was also scared she would see me as less attractive. Thankfully she didn't care and was supportive through the ordeal. I managed to finally get the couple the stop harassing me by threatening to post some videos we made online. Things will work in the end but I hate that I was essentially forced to out myself before I was comfortable",

If I hurt someone it has to be for a reason, and it just hurts me because the way she looks at me, it just doesn't feel right, that she looks at me as a violent person, especially when you sprinkle on the fact that I am a Male and we're muslims, so you can imagine what she thinks a man will do just because he's a man, and after all that, either no one takes me seriously or they never side with me or help me at least, just makes me feel worthless",
    "So I was terminated shortly after lockdowns last year after only ever recieving one write up a month and a half before. And this was in a year and a half long term with an employer. But business declined sharply and then after a couple of weeks with everyone getting their hours cut, I was terminated citing that I had violated the rulebook by smoking. In the block for unemployment that the employee provided the department of labor, there are 3 falsified write ups that I never saw or signed. One even has white out on it where they redacted something. I had been injured. In a neglect incident a few months before and was due two pay raises that had been promised. So my impression is that I was gotten rid of to cut labor expenses. But it was during a pandemic recession and I basically was reduced to homelessness. So I appealed.

Have a kid at home while having to be in the hospital for an extended stay? Have baby at 34 weeks/ a NICU stay? I am lost and could just use some advice/ experience/ or anything else.",
    "I'm interested in reading some of the worst you may've come across, whatever culture you're from and whichever nationality the pundit was. Like, there are the obvious ones like I once heard a Japanese commentator say \"David Pocockuuuu\" but I mean they're quite far away and all, but one of the worst I've heard might be a French commentator on Bein Sports pronouncing it \"Courtney LOVES\". No issue whatsoever with having an accent, no problem at all there, but when you're effectively transforming a name by reading it just the way your brain would spontaneously process it as a foreigner without getting a few basics in or checking with anyone beforehand, I find that amazing how lazy and unprofessional that is. For the entire match: \"Courtney Loves\".",
    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize. Great action scenes, big issue that touches past Bond and M which little is known. Sam Mendes does a masterful job directing this installment of James Bond. Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",
    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life. The animation looks great, the humor is on point of course, and the characters with so much more development. With some great moments is a fun sequel to all ages!",
    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for \"Airplane\", \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", and the \"Naked Gun\" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the \"Hotel Gay Schluffen\", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If \"Top Secret!\" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means \"She whose bosoms defy gravity\"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, \"Top Secret!\" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie.

It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither.

    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea.",
    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :<br/><br/><ul><li>Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole \"let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead\" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be \"safe\"? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!</li></ul><br/><br/>The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!<br/><br/>While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!<br/><br/>Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).<br/><br/>The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* \"twist\" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.<br/><br/>Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.<br/><br/>A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",
    "While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",
    "June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as \"Warriors of the Wind\" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible \"Princess Mononoke\" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer \"Nausicaa\". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort.",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (\"the Bear\") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of \"Glory Road\" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the \"Pit\". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about \"the Bear\" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as \"the Bear\". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book \"Glory Road\" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by \"the Bear\", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book \"Slam Dunk to Glory\". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.<br/><br/>I'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.<br/><br/>VALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",
    "That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful.

    "Terminator Salvation gets panned left and right.....but let me first say this is way more better then T3 and Genisys by miles.<br/><br/>Not only is it a serious terminator movie.....its more faithful to the first 2, yes it has plot holes and not die hard terminator violence but what do you expect when companies are trying to make everything PG13 for money.<br/><br/>This is the Terminator movie you get, to throwbacks to Guns n Rose you could be mine to a CGI arnie wreaking havoc, yes it could of been done better but some of it is actually really good, just accept and stop expecting the greatness of T2, that was cameron and this is MCG two different directors.<br/><br/>The acting is good, don't know what everyone is going on about with Bale being a weak connor when he is perfect for the role, yelchin plays a fantastic kyle reese and sam worthington is great as marcus.<br/><br/>Relax, watch and enjoy a good summer action movie with no expectations, the opening helicopter scene is a work of art.<br/><br/>TS - 7/10",
    "Once Jake Gyllenhaal signed on to do Nightcrawler I knew it would be a special film. The man has been producing nothing but gold lately and this is no different. Nightcrawler is an experience - it takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of seemingly charming slimeball reporter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). <br/><br/>Nightcrawler works on so many levels. The writing and direction is fantastic, which is especially impressive as it's the directorial debut by Dan Gilroy who takes on both duties. He had a clear vision of how he wanted to portray LA and the sleek, brooding yet slightly lackadaisical tone transfers perfectly onto the big screen. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance that's the polar opposite from his character in Prisoners and he was on point for every second. He was the perfect casting choice to carry the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a clear message on the media and how they abuse stories and reap the benefits regardless of who gets victimized. It's a message that has been told a million times before, but never quite like this. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou, who starts freelancing as a videographer of crime scenes and selling his footage to a news channel for money. We go along this journey with Lou and watch his transformation from being a sleazy but ambitious individual to becoming a manipulative, self-serving sociopath. Then you start to realize that he was like that all along. His charming charisma masked his true intentions, and this peek into his psyche is the most potent and disturbing aspect of the movie. It's a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle, and told with enough elegance and wit to keep you on board the whole way.<br/><br/>There's a dark comedic tone present throughout. Lou's persistence and crass remarks to basically anyone he encounters provide some good laughs. He doesn't sugarcoat anything, he'll talk to anyone in order to get his way, and he has a sleazy smirk that never fails to get a reaction. Also Gyllenhaal's chemistry with Rene Russo (the news director) is palatable and their work dynamic becomes more of a gripping co-dependency as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Nightcrawler is a must-watch for fans of cinema. It's a work of art from a directorial and writing standpoint, from an acting standpoint, and from a basic human nature standpoint. It really does a hell of a job at sucking you into this dark gloomy world to the point where you don't want to get out. It's intense, it's funny, it's thrilling, it's powerful, and most of all, it's real. Nightcrawler is simply sensational.",
    "Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'. <br/><br/>The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events. <br/><br/>In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.<br/><br/>One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.<br/><br/>Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games). <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work. <br/><br/>These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.<br/><br/>Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.<br/><br/>What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children. <br/><br/>Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain.",
    "It was made to be silly. There's nothing in this movie that's meant to offend anyone. It's a silly, fun-loving, harmless movie. I enjoyed it when I was 8 and I still do now at 18. Anyone who takes this movie seriously, needs to relax, have fun, enjoy the goofiness. This movie is one you can enjoy with your friends, family and young children DON'T have to be sent out of the room for inappropriate action.<br/><br/>It's silly, remember that. It's supposed to make you laugh!<br/><br/>All the girls are young, and the band still together. A few years later, everything fell apart for them. Enjoy the youth and laughter while you can.",
    "Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br/><br/>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br/><br/>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br/><br/>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br/><br/>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br/><br/>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br/><br/>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are great again<br/><br/>Charm returns<br/><br/>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Only one movie with Baby Groot? Noooo!<br/><br/>They seem to have dropped Drax's taking everything literal jokes away<br/><br/>Michael Rosenbaum was wasted<br/><br/>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br/><br/>Batista should have skipped over wrestling and just been an actor",
    "Having watched the film (more than once)i must say that i think that the person who wrote the comment \"A Stupid and Extremely Disappointing Movie\" is being silghtly childish. You cannot watch a film like Van Helsing with out taking it with a pinch of salt - it is a movie with vampires, werewolves and the frankenstine monster in at all at once for goodness sake. So you cannot go in to it thinking in a literal sense. You have to accept that it is not going to be some ground breaking epic and that it is just a bit of fun - but at the end of the day that doesn't matter, because if you go in with the right attitude and you enjoy it, then what does it matter that it is a bit \"off\" in places. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to any one who likes action/fantasy films and is up for a bit of fun!",
    "Ever wondered what it would be like to see Tom Cruise taking a break from his usual Sci-Fi & Impossible series \"avatar\". Well, here is your answer - It gets even more exciting and entertaining. This is Tom Cruise's real life take on the impossible series where Barry Seal replaces Ethan Hunt and CIA as the agency, which dictates the terms. It's just that Barry loves to go with the flow and without any intention of getting involved with anything that seems out of his league and this is something each one of us can relate to. He is your usual guy who happens to be a pilot and wants to make some extra cash with every extra mile. So what's wrong with it? Well nothing is wrong when you do it for the right guys, and nothing gets more exciting and dangerous when those right guys turn out to be CIA.<br/><br/>What is even more amusing and entertaining to watch is the fact that despite having no choice left but to cooperate with CIA, \"Barry Seal never says no\" to any offer (even if it comes from any drug lord) that helps him maintain his cash flow that obviously was becoming unmanageable for him by every passing day. Although, I must admit that it was quite a fun to watch him trying to manage millions of cash that he had no idea how to spend. <br/><br/>You will definitely enjoy watching Tom cruise as Barry Seal who uses CIA to get his end of the bargain (and they thought that they were the only smart guys who live in one of the greatest countries of the world).<br/><br/>If you want to go on an adventure trip, go watch this movie and you will understand what Tom Cruise really means when he says, \"I am just a gringo who always delivers\".",
    "Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982's Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.<br/><br/>The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. <br/><br/>The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.<br/><br/>The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.<br/><br/>\nThe Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph.",
    "The greatest fault of The Thin Red Line was its timing - it was released at around the same time as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.  While most people dismissed The Thin Red Line as the `other' World War II movie of 1998, it's actually a very different kind of film - the film itself is not hurt by similarity to Ryan but was hurt commercially due to the misconception. It's easy to forget that Red was nominated for seven Oscars.  This is an extraordinary film that can stand well on its own next to Ryan.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan was significant in that it visually depicted war in a realistic, gritty way.  The Thin Red Line's focus is more philosophical. It is about the contradiction between the beauty of nature and the destructive nature of men.  The movie cuts continuously between the external struggle of American GIs fighting to take a crucial hill from Japanese occupation on Guadalcanal - and more importantly, the internal chaos of war as every man tries to come to his own terms about matters such as morals, death, God, and love.<br/><br/>Unlike in Saving Private Ryan, there is nothing patriotic about this movie. In fact, there probably has never been a more anti-war film.  The fighting men here are disillusioned, lost, and frightened.  They don't fight for their country or \"democracy\" - they fight because they have to.  The only priorities are survival, and - for the more humane - caring for their comrades.  Renowned composer Hans Zimmer - who won an Oscar nomination for his work-captures the grim mood perfectly and allows us to hear the men's thoughts.<br/><br/>The characters are portrayed by a strong ensemble cast.  Acting is uniformly excellent, especially Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall, who is the unfeeling commander of the ground offensive on Guadalcanal. Thoroughly unlikable, he is the closest thing to a villain in the movie.  After studying war for an untold number of years, Tall sees Guadalcanal as his chance to prove himself and move up in the ranks - the men are only a tool to accomplish this goal and expendable.  In one crucial scene, he orders a captain (played by Elias Koteas, in another outstanding role) to lead his men to a frontal assault against a Japanese controlled hill.  When the captain suggests a more logical alternative, the colonel screams: \"You are not gonna take your men around in the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!\"  To this, the captain replies, `I've lived with these men, sir, for two and a half years and I will not order them all to their deaths.'  Later, when the hill is taken, he is dismissed of his duties as Tall sees him as a threat to the successful achievement of his goal.  Certainly, not every commander must have been that coldhearted and selfish, but surely some were, though not necessarily to that extreme.<br/><br/>While the acting is very good, much of the cast is relatively unknown and it can initially be hard to distinguish the characters from each other as they may appear to be very similar.  They are all about the same age, have dirt smeared over their faces, and wear helmets and the same military garb. Also, the stars in this movie have very small roles.  George Clooney and John Travolta are credited with starring roles while really little more than extras - clearly for marketing purposes.  You will not see more than two minutes of each.<br/><br/>One of the main themes of the movie is the contrast between nature and men's destructiveness in war.  The director, Terrence Malick, hired cinematographer John Toll to capture this on camera, and towards achieving that goal they couldn't have been more successful.  The almost surreal scenery is nothing short of stunning and has the same visual impact as any special effect.  The beauty of nature is always present, even when it is a setting for battle of destruction, and death.<br/><br/>Though the battle scenes fall short of the frightening realism in Saving Private Ryan, they are heads and soldiers above every previous attempt. One truly gets the sense that war is a chaotic, often hopeless environment where it is only a matter of luck whether you survive or get killed.<br/><br/>\n`How did we lose the good that was given us? Or let it slip away? Scatter it carelessly ... trade it for what has no worth?'  The film is filled with such poetic questions as to which there are no real answers.  This is definitely not a party movie.  There isn't anything uplifting about it - it is downright depressing.  Asides from entertainment value, however, this is a film that makes you think.",
    "Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised \" Esther's secret\" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the \"secret\" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a \"creepy\" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",
    "A Gen Z update to Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 cult classic, this remake is essentially an episode of Fast and Furious in which the vehicular exploits have been replaced with an assortment of extreme sports sequences. Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like \"the only law is gravity\" and \"everyone dies, it's just a matter of how\", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences, yet they're not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller.",
    "I went into this movie confident that it would be a cheesy, campy romp with the same \"tried and true tricks of the trade,\" like when the hero is investigating the creepy music coming from the basement and a cat jumps into frame, but I quickly discovered that this would not be case with Insidious. After watching the move and obsessing on it for about 12 hours now, I can honestly say it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. In fact, there were several points during the film where I screamed like a 13-year old girl at a Justin Beiber concert. Keep in mind I was consciously trying my hardest to keep my composure, mainly because I was sitting beside my new girlfriend of 2 months. She, incidentally, didn't make a peep; thankfully, I later found out she had her eyes closed the whole time. <br/><br/>I was also expecting to see some blood and guts, especially coming from the guys who made Saw, but there wasn't a drop. Instead, they used just about everything else in their arsenal to scare the bejesus out of me and everyone else in the theater (my girlfriend included). From literally the opening credits, they created an intense, haunting tension that didn't leave my body till several whiskeys and half a Xanax later. And the movie constantly feeds that tension, making even the characters' mundane family life somehow seem utterly terrifying. I was actually exhausted leaving the theater from all of the uncomfortable squirming I was unable to control. I'd say it's the most calories I've ever burned while watching a movie (well, at least a PG-13 movie). <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was great. It was crazy scary, thoroughly entertaining, and even surprisingly funny at times. Having said that, it will be quite some time before I watch another horror movie; I have no desire to be turned into a frazzled bundle of nerves again anytime soon. So, if you plan on seeing this movie, please consider this a cautionary reminder: it's probably best to go with someone who's already witnessed you have a complete physical and mental breakdown, so as to avoid an embarrassing drive home. And maybe bring a Xanax as well.",
    "People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. <br/><br/>What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.<br/><br/>Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. <br/><br/>Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.<br/><br/>Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.<br/><br/>You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",
    "It is a classic offbeat horror-melodrama merging harmoniously the family Gothic extravaganza, supernatural power, and a woman's movie of a peculiar kind It remains the cinema's best adaptation of a Stephen King novel <br/><br/>The film initiated De Palma's inclination for surprise diverts between playful imagination and reality, as in the opening, which swifts from a soft-core porn fantasia of girls taking a shower in the locker room to the fact of Carrie's menstruation for the first timethe first sign of \"otherness\" that will reserve her as an horrifying monster from her small-minded colleagues <br/><br/>All the oppression that Carrie undergoes both at home (with a bible beating maniacal mother played by scary Piper Laurie who develops twisted bizarre ideas) and at school to suppress tension which takes the shape of super telekinetic power, the ability to move objects with the strength of her mind We observe with ambivalence as Carrie's insatiable revenge jumps the line into uncontrolled mass murders ever filmed <br/><br/>Sissy Spacek is amazing as the mocked, helpless girl pushed over the edge Her face and body twist like a living special effect to unleash her pent up rage, as well as her character's alarming progress from painfully shy high-school teenager to Angel of Vengeance",
    "This movie is soooo gross! The eye scene? Puke rising up to my mouth just thinking about it! Blech!!! So much excessive horror nastiness! Sick as heck, but just hard not to watch! Throw in the gorgeous women, and you've got a disgustingly beautiful horror flick!<br/><br/>I loved the Oli character - the king of swing - \"Of course my horse\"! And the gang of young boys that want gum! So weird! I also liked the whole Europeaness of the film - the location, language, and overall feel of it! Lent a big piece of realism to it all.<br/><br/>My negative rant is that I wanted to know more about the town, and the people, and the \"why\" of it all. I know money is part/most of it. But I wanted to know why.",
    "Sacha Baron Cohen comes to America in the guise of Borat Sagdiyev and wreaks his own brand of Kazakhi havoc in this very very funny film.<br/><br/>In our age of uber-political correctness, \"Borat\" comes sweeping through like a brisk and refreshing wind, completely bounding over every cultural taboo we've erected around ourselves. Thus, no one is safe: Borat takes on Jews, blacks, gays, feminists, middle-Americans, religious fanatics, frat boys. The only weapon against the bumbling Borat is a sense of humour, which this movie shows most Americans painfully lack. Indeed, if there is any message to be had from \"Borat\" (and I'm not sure there is much of one, beyond its fascinating cultural experiments), it's that everyone needs to lighten up and not take themselves so seriously.<br/><br/>The image of Americans projected in this film varies from the heartwarming to the downright frightening. New Yorkers threaten Borat with physical violence when he approaches them on a subway. Feminists walk out on him when they find his views on women too much to tolerate. Folks out in the heartland commiserate with him over his hatred of gays and Jews; a gun shop owner even helps him pick out the best weapon for shooting Jewish people. A sweet Jewish couple give him a place to sleep, and bring him a homey meal (that is, before they turn into invading cockroaches). A group of manic Pentecosts help him find Jesus. An RV full of frat boys make complete asses of themselves by espousing their hopelessly ill-informed views on minorities in our country and the need to revert to slavery. The majority of people treat Borat in the condescending way of those who want to think of themselves as being culturally aware without really knowing anything at all about other cultures. These people become rude the second Borat offends their sense of propriety. On the other hand, the disenfranchised of America greet Borat with open arms, and we see a group of gays and a group of blacks interacting with him as if no cultural boundaries existed at all. The film's sweetest (and most unexpectedly so) moments come from Borat's befriending of a black prostitute.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a carefully crafted work of fiction, and Cohen only lets his audience see what he wants them to see. I would probably react much the same as many of the people in this film if this crazy-looking and sounding man appeared out of nowhere and began to antagonize me. But the movie does make Americans look like a bunch of awfully self-important, uptight stiffs, and I've been to enough places in this country and met enough people to realize that the way events play out in this film (even if they are manipulated or staged) probably come very close to the real thing.<br/><br/>Thank God for movies like \"Borat.\" If nothing else, they remind us that our cultural boundaries only matter as much as we let them, and that all of the fears that govern political correctness are mostly ungrounded. After all, virtually every person in this film was offended at one point or another, and as far as I can tell, all of them lived to tell about it.<br/><br/>Grade: A",
    "In bringing together elements from Inglourious Basterds, Ocean's Eleven and Museum Hours, George Clooney certainly had plenty of opportunity for a rich and interesting story. War heroes who appreciate fine art played by the likes of Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman (plus a few \"that guy\"s), attempting to steal back priceless works of art from the Nazis, it sounds amazing.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? Well, to begin with, for a movie about a team, we're given very little time with them as a group. Almost immediately they pair off on their own little adventures. Instead of using these exploits to let us know a little more about the characters as individuals, we get the usual oddball pairings and some mildly amusing, but ultimately hollow, vignettes. Even when we lose some of our team, it really feels like nothing more than just something that happened on the trip, like \"oh, and I also saw a horse.\" We have hardly any sense of them as a group and far less about them as people. The only character whose motivations we can understand is the one played by Cate Blanchett, but her limited chemistry with Matt Damon dooms what little redemptive quality her character had.<br/><br/>Also, and particularly troubling for a movie involving art, George Clooney's lens has little reverence for the work it shows. Though the film heavy-handedly ponders whether a piece of art is worth a human life, the camera never does. Even when a character lays down his life for a sculpture, it comes off less dramatic than inevitable. The film treats the works as being mostly historically significant and never finds that lover's gaze that tells the audience why.<br/><br/>What we're left with is a bag of spare parts. It's a popcorn movie with no setpieces. A war movie with no battles. A heist movie with no scheming. An art movie with no inspiration. Were they to have found some of Inglourious Basterds' bluster, Ocean's Eleven smarts or Museum Hour's insight, they may have found a formula that works, but that's not the movie we have here. I'll be damned if George Clooney doesn't look good in a moustache, though.",
    "There's a lot of anxiety that goes into viewing The Exorcist, \"the scariest movie ever made\", for the very first time. And with that anxiety comes a lot of expectations and preconceived ideas about what The Exorcist *should* be. Especially for someone born after the film. Then on top of that waited years before finally seeing it.<br/><br/>I love the Exorcist, and after exposure to God knows how many horror films, the Exorcist remains my favorite within the genre. And even from a die-hard fan I have to admit, I hate hearing \"scariest movie of all time\" associated with this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, there's no reason to compare fright factor of films, so forget that anyone ever called The Exorcist \"the scariest movie ever made.\" Take any movie  I don't care what movie  and stick a \"greatest/scariest/best\" whatever tag next to it, and you'll have audiences investing in what they *think* it should be instead of letting the film present itself for what it is. And all they see is that it is not what they expected (expectations, I might add, that are shaped by the current gimmicks and trends in Hollywood).<br/><br/>I love the Exorcist because it dared to defy my expectations. This is not a wall-to-wall, credits-to-credits montage of scary imagery inspired by a mere scenario that's supposed to pass as a plot. This isn't a movie about that long dark corridor and something waiting to jump out of the darkness and attack (which is always preceded by a false scare featuring a cat). It's not about that cheap gimmicky scenario of X amount of people isolated from the rest of the world, with a killer/monster/ghost/whatever on the loose.<br/><br/>The Exorcist is a very slow movie that actually features a full blown plot, its characters, and their associated arcs. The original ambition of The Exorcist was to scare the world with imagery and concepts never before seen in cinema. Shocking moments that the audience of 1973 could not believe they would ever see on the silver screen (from a major studio, no less.) After 30 years, the movie isn't so shocking because times have changed, and the success of the Exorcist has guaranteed countless imitation in all forms across all boards. However, the Exorcist is still one of the most ambition horror films ever made, because (are you ready for this?)  the Exorcist dares to tell a story.<br/><br/>Everyone remembers the pea soup, the head spinning, the vulgarities spewed from the demon's mouth, the stairs, the infamous cut (now restored) spider walk. But I adore this movie for the things no one seems to bring up  I love the setup in Iraq where Father Lancaster Merrin detects the signs of his final showdown, and how these abstract scenes on subsequent viewings give the movie a more epic feel. I love the transition from Chris MacNeil to Father Karras walking across campus that's reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. I became absorbed watching Father Karras caring for his aging mother and the close relationship they have, seeing him depressed and sharing a drink with a fellow priest as he discusses his own issues with faith.<br/><br/>And what impresses me most about a movie named the Exorcist is how it seems to reject the possibility of possession and exorcism as its ultimate and final solution. The characters in the movie don't want it to be true, and in fact don't really even know about the possibility of Exorcism, thus they explore and exhaust all other possibilities (both medical and psychological). I smiled with delight (after all the hospital scenes) in that priceless moment when Chris MacNeil asks Karras, \"And how does one go about getting an exorcism?\" which stops father Karras in his tracks as he, a man of the church, looks at her as though she's lost her mind.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie resists the temptation to jump right into the acknowledgment that Regan is possessed continues to build up the epic Good versus Evil, God versus Satan, the exorcist versus the demon, feel. Like the characters, the movie doesn't want it to be true, it doesn't want to go there and embrace that possibility, but we the audience know what must inevitably happen. And it's almost magical how the movie finally acknowledges Regan's only hope. There's no glorious fanfare nor is there boastful ultimatums, instead the movie lamentingly and silently surrenders to it as we watch Lancaster Merrin walking up the sunny garden path, staring down at a newly delivered envelope. He doesn't have to read it. He already knows what it says, as do we.<br/><br/>The imagery then fades to an ominous foggy night as a taxi pulls up to the MacNeil place in Georgetown, then we're treated to the haunting imagery that inspired the cover art. What must be done, must be done. I love how the movie implies that Merrin has faced this very demon before through its imagery, and through the dialogue as Karras explains he's identified at least three manifestations to which Merrin answers, \"No. There is only one.\" I can address more  the acting, the beautiful cinematography, brilliant makeup  but I'll stop to keep from sounding like a raving fan who over hypes every inch of everything. I'll close with these thoughts: I'm not the type of person who will watch the same movie over and over and over. Most movies I see, the specific imagery and specific ideas don't make a deep enough impression to stick with me for more than a few months. I remember the Exorcist, not because I thought it was the \"scariest movie ever made\", rather because of the wonderful craftsmanship, the fact that it dared to tell a story, and it defied my expectations.<br/><br/>When Friday the 13th, the Grudge, Skeleton Key, and Cursed are reduced to vague memories and general ideas, I will still clearly remember the Exorcist.",
    "This movie is 20 years old, but it's still the most enjoyable movie I've seen in ages. Why can't they make movies like this again?",
    "The film that bested Star Wars for the 1977 Best Picture Oscar, Annie Hall is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking that transcends its simple, romantic premise to create a stunning portrait of not only 70's pop culture, but of human nature cumulative.  Directed and co-written by Woody Allen, who has since directed other gems such as Hannah and Her Sisters and The Purple Rose of Cairo, Annie Hall also stars Allen as Alvy Singer, a neurotic, death-obsessed comedian who seems unlucky in love and life.  That is until he meets Annie, brilliantly played by Diane Keaton, who is beautiful, fashion-savvy, carefree (she likes using expressions like `la di da'), and a terrible driver.<br/><br/>Annie and Alvy's relationship is an unlikely one.  She's a Midwestern girl, straight out of white-bread Wisconsin; he's a life-long New York Jew who grew up (literally) under the Coney Island roller coaster.  He's been seeing a therapist for the past 16 years; she only `needs' one once she meets him. She's an extroverted aspiring singer; he's an introverted, world-despising imp.  Yet Allen and Keaton are so perfect in their roles, they improbably make this couple one of the most memorable ever.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Alvy's chronicles of loves lost and a retrospective on his relationship with Annie, with whom he has since parted ways.  At the end of the film, we see Alvy try his hand at stage-writing-he writes a play about his relationship with Annie, but gives it a happy ending.  Yes, Annie and Alvy don't have a fairy tale ending to their relationship, but Alvy certainly wishes they had, even though he learns to live with the acknowledgment it has failed.<br/><br/>The best part of Annie Hall is its incredible screenplay-the best ever to be written.  Not a word is wasted nor a line unquotable.  Except here, while Allen's early films had thrived on streams of one-liners, Allen doesn't go for cheap laughs-each line is simultaneously hilarious and poignant. Everything is part of a greater whole.  We laugh because it's funny, but there's a greater dynamic at work in Annie Hall.  This is a story not exclusively about a relationship between two people, but also a musing on 70's politics, drugs, East Coast/West Coast rivalry, narcissism, religion, celebrity, and several other topics with which Allen deals with extraordinary ease.<br/><br/>Yet Annie Hall would not be among my favorite films of all-time if it were just Woody Allen ranting and raving about what he likes and dislikes. There are other Allen films that serve that purpose, i.e. Deconstructing Harry, and they're not nearly as good.  What separates Annie Hall is its grace, the believable chemistry between Keaton and Allen, the unique direction (ranging from split-screens to cartoon imagery to on-screen subtitles of what the actors are thinking), but mostly because it's the rare film to find a perfect balance between sheer entertainment, humor, and poignancy.<br/><br/>\nWhen the dust had settled, Diane Keaton deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance, Allen took home Oscars for direction and writing, and the film beat out Star Wars for Best Picture, which most people consider a complete sham.  Evidently, those people didn't see Annie Hall, for if they had, they'd recognize that the acting, writing, and even the direction in Star Wars can't hold a candle to Annie Hall, one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "With poor plotting, inconsistent pacing and a rushed sense of chemistry amongst the new cast Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales exposes the swashbuckling sequel as nothing more than a cash-grab that's as hollow as the ships they occupy.",
    "In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:<br/><br/>First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: \nIs Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?<br/><br/>Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.<br/><br/>During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",
    "Mike Newell is the weirdest choice for director of a Mafia drama, but he actually makes a terrific fist of it, delivering one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are all in top form in front of the camera, too.<br/><br/>Depp plays undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone in this intriguing true story. Pistone is trying to infiltrate his way into a mob family in order to gather evidence against them. He assumes the identity of \"Donnie Brasco\" and slowly but surely earns the love and trust of an old-pro hit-man named Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino). As the months go by, Pistone's marriage begins to fall apart as he is away from his wife (Heche) pretty much all the time. The line between his real life and his undercover life blurs together and he finds himself dangerously close to being seduced by the violent Mob lifestyle.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is an extraordinary film in many ways. As already mentioned, the performances are note-perfect. But there's so much more to it than that. The late 70s period details are impeccably captured; the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic; the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly, agonisingly conveyed. It's such a powerful picture, completely involving, that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament, asking yourself what decisions you would make in the same circumstances. Very few movies genuinely inspire you to debate the whats, whys and wherefores of the main character and his actions... but with Donnie Brasco, that's just what you'll find yourself doing.",
    "One might argue Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film, since it lacks almost everything you'll find in almost all of them: shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers, even blood. The most graphic scene is a nightmare sequence that displays a rape scene so stylized it isn't actually disturbing. But one might also argue that Rosemary's Baby is a horror film in its purest form, since it doesn't depend on all those gimmicks to create its atmosphere. I prefer the latter point of view. <br/><br/>So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly, there is something strange about them - the sounds that come from their apartment, the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbors, and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive, especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant - she recommends her another (better, as she says) gynecologist's and mixes a (healthy, as she says) herbal drink for her every day. <br/><br/>The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant: Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner (Pregnant women are supposed to gain, not lose weight, a visiting friend observes), and when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbors, her gynecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying. <br/><br/>All this is told by Roman Polanski in the perfect tone; the mood for the entire film is already set during the opening credits when we hear that weird lullaby, sung by Mia Farrow. And a lot of strange things happen throughout the entire film: Guy and Rosemary are told by Hutch, a friend of theirs, about the horrific past of the house they're now living in, a young girl that lives with the Castevets commits suicide (really a suicide?), Guy, an actor, gets the role he wanted so badly after the contestant who was originally supposed to play it turns blind, and Hutch, who might have found something out that would help Rosemary, suddenly is in a coma and dies three months later; all these (and a few other) events are precisely dosed by Polanski to draw us more and more into the film, while he makes sure on the other hand that the film doesn't become absurd. And he manages to give the film an ending that works, makes sense and is observant, slightly (but only slightly) funny and very disturbing, all at once. <br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby also contains two of the most memorable performances ever: Mia Farrow is haunting as Rosemary Woodhouse. She looks like she is physically suffering from her pregnancy and close to complete despair. And Ruth Gordon is amazing as the curious Minnie Castevet, always friendly, but also giving you the feeling that, hidden behind her generosity, she actually follows her own, obscure motives. If you have a helpful elderly female neighbor, you'll see her with other eyes once you've encountered Minnie Castevet. So, if you think a real horror film needs shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers or at least blood - watch Rosemary's Baby and you'll change your mind.",
    "Cube is a movie that explores human nature and our instinctive urges for survival vs our humanitarianism. Not a new concept, I know, however this movie does it in style, with a plot so simple that it could only be the work of a conceptual genius. I don't intend to give too much away, as the power of the film lies in it's mystery, but I will say that this movie could almost be classified as disturbing, not due to its content, but rather the thoughts that it instills in the audience. I found myself rather shaken as I left the cinema, feeling as though I had been exposed to an ugly, hidden side of humanity and society. Don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely worth seeing, I would even be so bold as to say that it must be seen! I must admit that there are few movies I have seen that have had such a profound affect on me, and I don't think I am alone in my feelings.",
    "This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun.",
    "I watch a lot of movies & I can't remember the last time a film held me so spellbound. Not only are the characters engaging & vividly portrayed by an excellent cast, the subtle dynamics of their interactions are portrayed with inspired undertone & nuance. Star billing or even an Oscar should also have been awarded to the spectacularly beautiful scenery of Montana for the vast majesty it bestowed.<br/><br/>This complex saga of love, grief & loyalty is narrated with stark simplicity by old Stab, long-time friend to retired Colonel Ludlow & his 3 sons: staid Alfred, the eldest (\"old even for his years\"); idealistic Samuel, the youngest (\"There was nothing these brothers would not do for him.\"); & wild Tristan (\"Such people become crazy or they become legends.\"). The conflict between Ludlow's fiercely anti-government anti-war stance & his sons' determination to do what they see as their duty is but a small part of the story; the heart of the tale is the rift that threatens the mutual devotion of these 3 loyal brothers as they all come to love the same woman. \"She was not to blame,\" Stab tells us, \"She was like the ice that freezes in the rock and splits it apart.\"<br/><br/>A tragic tale, yes; heartbreaking at times, but never boring. Every time I felt certain I knew what was coming next, the plot took another unexpected turn & I sat there riveted, softly breathing \"Wow!\" now & again into the darkness. This film immediately became one of my all-time favorites; I've watched it half a dozen times since then & its scope & power never fail to move me.",
    "At only 29 years of age and in only his second major studio release, Stanley Kubrick showed the world that he was a force to be reckoned with. By the time he died 42 years later his films were epochal events waited for breathlessly by his large band of devotees who considered him a director without equal. He seldom disappointed them.<br/><br/>This movie is set in World War I amidst the incredibly destructive and futile trench warfare between France and Germany. Kirk Douglas plays Frenchman Colonel Dax, who is ordered to make an impossible assault on a heavily-fortified enemy position. The only reason this charge is being made is that his commanding general, played by George Macready, believes that capturing the position will earn him a promotion. When the assault does not go forward under heavy enemy bombardment, the general is infuriated and demands that three men be arbitrarily chosen to stand trial for cowardice, an offense punishable by death. Col. Dax defends these men at their court-martial.<br/><br/>The battle and trial scenes are about as good as have ever been filmed and the high level of tension is sustained throughout the movie. After the film's climax has occurred, Col. Dax goes looking for his troops and finds them relaxing at a cafe. What he and the viewer witness there is possibly the most affecting scene I've ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>Looking at this film in perspective, it's easy to see Kubrick's trademarks even at this early stage of his career. The attention to the composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. I find myself most impressed today with the way he could handle a dramatic story like this one without any innovative techniques or unusual special effects to hide behind, then turn around and make such totally different films like '2001...' and 'Dr. Strangelove...' Other films like 'The Shining' and 'Barry Lyndon' combined a strong story line with breakthrough film techniques. His versatility astonishes me.<br/><br/>Adolphe Menjou also stars as the general who convinces Dax's superior officer to risk the ill-fated charge. Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey and Joe Turkel give strong performances as the men on trial. Turkel turns up 23 years later in another Kubrick film, 'The Shining,' playing the bartender.<br/><br/>You can take your pick: 'Paths of Glory' can rightly be described as one of the greatest war movies of all, or one of the great anti-war films, or as one of Kubrick's best. Or simply one of the best, period.",
    "Reading the back cover of the DVD and seeing that Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley are given top billing, I expected an intelligent King Arthur story. Well, it really wasn't either, although I did find it entertaining. I must not have read the description carefully enough. No matter; overall, it was fun but just a little too silly. I'm beginning to wonder about the discernment of some of these actors, how they can play such intelligent roles for a film or two and then revert to something like this.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story is really a Roman empire one, not a King Arthur story. We only see the tie-in to the later in the last few minutes of the film, in the epilogue. This action story is all about the last Caesar, a small boy, and the last legion that fought as Rome had now been taken over by the Goths. The Roman Empire had come to an end.<br/><br/>Mixed in with that tale was the famous \"excalibur\" sword. We see the origins of that and how it eventually got into the hands of King Arthur. But, once again, that is only explained in the final minutes. However, the sword is used by the good Roman general who protects the last Caesar from the Goths, who want him imprisoned for life, or killed.<br/><br/>What made the story interesting, at least for me, was the chase-scene type atmosphere of a small band of heroes protecting a little boy, fleeing the bloodthirsty Goths until they could mount some sort of counter-attack in the north in Brittania. That, and the pretty computer-generated scenery and action stunts, kept it interesting. However, don't look for credibility in those action scenes and expect the typical political-correctness of today (i.e. where a woman beats up hundreds of men and the good guys of all colors prevail despite ridiculous odds).<br/><br/>Some parts of this will leave you shaking your head in disbelief. You will feel you're watching a kids' film at times. However, if you want an hour-and-a-half of decent escapist fare, and can put your brain on hold for that time, it fits the bill and will at least entertain you.",
    "A stand-alone monument in cinema history, Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions, but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I've never seen a person say, \"2001: A Space Odyssey? I don't think I've seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?\", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you \"get it\" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is \"...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness.\" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that's sheer genius at its highest form.<br/><br/>At its premiere, 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200, including Rock Hudson who asked, \"Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?\" The New York Times remarked, \"Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring.\" \"Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,\" Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 \"trash masquerading as art\". It's understandable, though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk, audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise, 2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.<br/><br/>Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism, Kubrick saw ahead, highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity, respect, and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance, grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man, with his limited senses, cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light), Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty, emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public, for \"if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning\", as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester), it may cause \"cultural shock and social disorientation\". It's a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.<br/><br/>Yet apes are not much better. They're not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes, and with the discovery of bones as weapons, kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors, at heart, mankind has been and will always be selfish.<br/><br/>Far before The Terminator (1984) or The Matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence, there was 2001. H.A.L 9000, voice played by Douglas Rain, was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There's something about his calm voice, unpredictability, and especially, his omniscient single red eye that's so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. Neither Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) or Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film, while H.A.L, albeit a machine, exhibits some while pleading for life singing \"Daisy\" (which, by the way, is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity's fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank, Dave, and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L, contrast to what he may think, is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit, he wouldn't have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race, but if we are not careful, they soon will.<br/><br/>This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence, resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous \"Star Gate\" sequence, Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era, exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground, establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous, magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod, he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating, suggesting that man, no matter how advanced, will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later, he reaches out to the monolith, alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened, he inevitably dies.<br/><br/>A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a \"Space Baby\", an infinitely more advanced race, marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius, Kubrick ends hopeful, giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending, and it's a question for you to answer.<br/><br/>There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001's composition throughout the film, possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony, practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky's work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty, Kubrick's artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot, averaging 13.6 seconds, possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.<br/><br/>But of course, it's impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it's hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects, clever rotating sets, fastidiously constructed spaceships, the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence, or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting, but what's the point? You don't need me to appreciate 2001's immaculate visuals.<br/><br/>Finally, the choice of music is outstanding. Originally, Alex North was appointed to score the film, but Kubrick turned it down in post-production. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly, \"North's (rejected) score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.\"<br/><br/>\"But why all the slow parts?\" asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily, to establish tone. Unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it, 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not, challenges humanity's fate, and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot's average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between, the whole film would've been a mess. Space isn't fast-paced like we see in most movies. Space is slow-really, really, slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius, a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.<br/><br/>Thankfully, its ingenuity was gradually recognized, and it's now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive #6 on the BFI \"Sight and Sound\" Critics' poll in 2012, ties for 2nd in the Director's poll, places 15th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of \"greatest science-fiction films of all time\".<br/><br/>2001: A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags, the dialogue is unnatural, the static camera creates no visual interest, there are barely any emotional punches, characters are monotonous, and none of the protagonists, if there even are, have dimensionality, arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless, it's transcendental and sublime, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, visually revolutionary, technically impeccable, monumentally imaginative, substantially rich, and way ahead of its time, thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.<br/><br/>Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them. Happy 50th birthday.",
    "Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen `losers to winners' sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).<br/><br/>All this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things. You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.<br/><br/>Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.<br/><br/>The comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.<br/><br/>There isn't much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn't fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational `Hoosiers' imitation was misplaced.<br/><br/>This film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel `The Leg' Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.<br/><br/>This film won't be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.  I rated it an 8/10.  Subtract two points if you aren't amused by slapstick and boorish behavior, and another two if you aren't a football fan.  For the rest of you, be prepared to split a gut.",
    "The Favourite, the seventh feature from Greek auteur <a href=\"/name/nm0487166/\">Yorgos Lanthimos</a>, is a film that eschews both convention and expectation. On the other hand, it's also Lanthimos's most accessible by a country mile. A savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power - it's all of these and yet none of them. A film I liked but didn't love, on the one hand, it's too long, the plot too threadbare, and the metaphors and allegories too ill defined. On the other, the acting is flawless, it looks amazing, the first half is very, very funny, and the end is very, very dark, with the last shot one of the most haunting/disturbing images I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Set in England in 1708, the film tells the story of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (an icy <a href=\"/name/nm0001838/\">Rachel Weisz</a>) and one-time scullery maid Abigail Hill (<a href=\"/name/nm1297015/\">Emma Stone</a>, charting a course from doe-eyed ingénue to vicious Machiavellian intrigant) and their increasingly bitter rivalry for the affections of Queen Anne (an absolutely mesmerising <a href=\"/name/nm1469236/\">Olivia Colman</a>), and is the first film Lanthimos has directed which neither he nor <a href=\"/name/nm3328207/\">Efthymis Filippou</a> wrote (the script was originally written by <a href=\"/name/nm7629302/\">Deborah Davis</a> in 1998 and later refined by <a href=\"/name/nm1110111/\">Tony McNamara</a>). Although it deals with real historical personages and events, historians probably won't be too thrilled to learn that Lanthimos is relatively uninterested in either historical actuality or socio-political contextualisation (to say nothing of the slam dancing). This is a story about a love triangle, with everything else just the background noise against which that triangle plays out.<br/><br/>And it is most definitely a Yorgos Lanthimos film, with his peculiar Weltanschauung omnipresent. The emotionless and monotone delivery of dialogue has been scaled back considerably from <a href=\"/title/tt3464902/\">The Lobster (2015)</a> and <a href=\"/title/tt5715874/\">The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017)</a>, but everything else you'd expect is here - the pseudo-omniscient judgemental glare; the dark absurdist humour; the formal rigidity; the emotional isolation of the characters; the surrealism; the games of psychological one-upmanship; the alienation of the audience; the thematic centrality of shifting power relations; the lack of distinction between poignancy and joviality; the use of self-contained and closed off pocket universes where characters must play by rules differing from those of the outside world; intimate familial conflict (except in bigger rooms than in his previous films); and a disorienting score. Similarly, whilst The Lobster was a savage dystopian-set allegory for discipline and conformity, The Favourite is a merciless satire of decadence and pettiness, taking in such additional themes as class, gender, love, lust, duty, loyalty, partisan politics, patriarchal hegemony, and women behaving just as appallingly as men.<br/><br/>As one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless, with many of the compositions having the appearance of a fête galante painting, so meticulously integrated are <a href=\"/name/nm0694309/\">Sandy Powell</a>'s costume design, <a href=\"/name/nm2356249/\">Fiona Crombie</a>'s production design, and <a href=\"/name/nm0752811/\">Robbie Ryan</a>'s cinematography. Powell's costumes are historically inaccurate, but thematically revealing, with the situation of the characters at any given moment directly influencing the design, especially in relation to Abigail as she climbs the social ladder. In a more general sense, the black-and-white colour scheme of much of the wardrobe contrasts magnificently with Crombie's predominantly brown production design, with the actors effortlessly standing out from the backgrounds.<br/><br/>Of Ryan's photography, perhaps the most impressive feat is that, despite the many scenes tracking characters through rooms, up stairs, and out doorways, there's not a single Steadicam shot anywhere in the film. He also makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which distort the spaces the characters occupy whilst also showing much more of the environment than a normal lens, creating the sense of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. Combined with the whip pans seen throughout the film, the cumulative effect is a world rendered strange, a place of distortion and unnatural compositions. As with most of Lanthimos' work, the film also uses natural light, which makes for some stunning candle-lit night-time compositions, partially recalling the paintings of someone like Jean-Antoine Watteau or, even moreso, Georges de La Tour.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, there really are no words to describe just how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she is able to elicit empathy mere moments after behaving thoroughly shamefully, communicating a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Yes, she can be a horrible person with appalling manners and questionable hygiene, but she is also deeply lonely, a survivor who has lost 17 children in childbirth, a woman whose health has made her old before her time, a tragic figure too naïve to see how badly she is being manipulated by Sarah and Abigail. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, illuminating Anne's humanity amongst her least appealing characteristics, and finding both wit and pathos in a character whose mercurial nature and excessive neediness could easily have rendered her the film's antagonist. It truly is one of the finest on-screen performances in a long time.<br/><br/>The film's most salient theme, one could argue its very raison d'être, is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, it's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the men are portrayed as petty, vainglorious idiots. Men, in general, are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped - with their ridiculous wigs and heavy makeup, they exist only to support the women. However, what's especially interesting about the film's depiction of gender is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. Sure, the women are much smarter than the men who surround them, but they are no less greedy or cruel. At the film's post-première press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos explained, \"what we tried to do is portray women as human beings. Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends...Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings.\" Similarly, when asked by the Hollywood Reporter if a film about females treating each other badly might be considered a setback in a post #MeToo era, Colman explained, \"How can it set women back to prove that women fart and vomit and hate and love and do all the things men do? All human beings are the same. We're all multifaceted, many-layered, disgusting and gorgeous and powerful and weak and filthy and brilliant. That's what's nice. It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy.\"<br/><br/>As regards criticisms, although I personally wouldn't class them as flaws, some people will probably dislike the same things that many have disliked in Lanthimos's previous work - cold formal rigidity, perverse sense of humour, and irredeemable characters being irredeemably horrible to one another. There will be those who find the obviously intentional anachronisms too much, whilst others will take umbrage with the disregard for historical authenticity. For me, whilst I admire Lanthimos for trying to bring something new to his oeuvre, especially when compared to Sacred Deer (which just repeated the beats of The Lobster), I felt the film was oftentimes trying to work its way through an identity crisis, unsure of exactly what kind of tone to settle on. I had similar feelings about the allegories that run throughout, and are never what you would call fully fleshed out. Obviously, it's a treatise on power and the ridiculous opulence of royalty, but that's not exactly an untapped issue in cinema. Additionally, one of my biggest problems with Sacred Deer was how utterly pointless it felt, and although I got a lot more out of The Favourite, I had something of the same reaction to it. It could also be argued that the characters are a little two dimensional, and filmgoers who need a protagonist to latch onto, someone to root for, will be left rudderless.<br/><br/>Superior to <a href=\"/title/tt1859446/\">Alpeis (2011)</a> and Sacred Deer, but not a patch on <a href=\"/title/tt1379182/\">Kynodontas (2009)</a> or The Lobster, The Favourite will probably attract a sizable unprepared audience because of awards buzz, positive reviews, and excellent trailer. Undoubtedly, for a lot of people, this will be their first exposure to Lanthimos, and I can only imagine what people expecting a Merchant Ivory costume drama will make of it all. Neither morally enlightening nor historically respectful, The Favourite offers a bleak assessment of humanity's core drives; not Lanthimos's bleakest, but a hell of a lot more nihilistic than an average multiplex goer will be used to. The characters within the film live in a milieu of egotism, narcissism, sexual cruelty, psychological bullying, greed, and hunger for power. There's barely a hint of sentimentality, and very little that could be called morally righteous. I would have liked it to have more meat on its bones, but at the same time, one cannot deny that it presents something of a faithful looking-glass, as Lanthimos continues to corner the market in pointing out not just humanity's worst foibles, but its most egregious eccentricities and lamentable character defects.",
    "I'm usually pretty cynical about cheesy movies but this movie absolutely floored me.  Drew Barrymore was phenomenal playing role of Julia Sullivan. I've seen the movie at least 30 times by now and her expressions still make me cry, they're just so sincere. I don't know how else to put it.  As for Adam Sandler I think that this is his best role yet, he's a real person in this movie not just some overgrown immature goofball.  On top of everything it's a brilliant 80s satire, for me its right up there with American Psycho. I understand why someone would have reservations about watching this movie but my advice would be to put your cynicism aside for a couple of hours and just watch with an uncritical mind.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",
    "Train to Busan was a treat. <br/><br/>A look into Selfishness vs Selflessness and Individual vs The Collective.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a foreign film this much. The cinematography is excellent, the story is original, and I will definitely be keeping an eye on Sang-ho Yeon's future projects.",
    "Cute movie. Has a couple of great messages -- especially one about prejudices. There are some adult jokes, some childish jokes, lots of laugh out loud moments but most importantly the following messages: Hatred against those we don't know is wrong; Let yourself get to know a person before deciding whether they are good or not; and go along for the ride and let yourself enjoy life.<br/><br/>I also love the fact that this is a Dad raising his child situation. There are really few movies that show a Dad can step up and do the right thing for their children if given the chance.<br/><br/>While I didn't particularly care for the fart joke or some of the childish parts the kids in the theater laughed and laughed.<br/><br/>Well done!",
    "I think this film is wonderful. It is sheer entertainment for kids and hilarious for adults.<br/><br/>I first watched this movie age 7, and i loved it...now i watch it again age 14 and I'm howling with laughter. The 'You wanna buy a sundial?' sequence renders me unable to breathe for laughter, whilst when i was younger it got not so much as a giggle.<br/><br/>As with all Disney films, the jokes are for the 'big kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!<br/><br/>Overall - 8/10",
    "I saw this at a special screening. I have not stopped thinking about it since. A emotional and powerful film that I will remember forever. I can't fault anyone who doesn't want to see this film. But please put to rest any fears that this film was made purely to turn a profit and serves no purpose.<br/><br/>For all those who were afraid that this film would be exploitive, propaganda filled Hollywood schlock, I'm sorry to say that could not be farther from the truth.<br/><br/>Though for the most part I'm still at a loss for words I'll do my best to give you a short and sweet overview. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible by making a Hollywood film about this subject everyone is afraid to touch, but made it in such a way that it's hard to find fault, despite everyone's initial misgivings. No 'rah rah' patriotism. No veiled political stances. No cartoonish villains. No making the enemy sympathetic. Just a brilliantly executed look at what did happen and what 'might' have happened on that fateful day.<br/><br/>What makes it more effective is that all throughout you don't recognize any of the actors. They may as well be \"real people\". You're never thinking to yourself, 'oh that's Nicolas Cage', conscious of the fact that it's acting. And come to find out, many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves! This makes it all the more real and draws you in and takes you back to that day.<br/><br/>And when the passengers decide to fight back? There's no swelling of violins or slow motion shots. They don't have a rallying cry or 'lets do it for Uncle Sam' type speech to motivate everyone. No, these passengers were reacting spontaneously to the situation as it played out and were acting on their survival instinct. You can't help but think how you would react in that situation and makes it all the more compelling and powerful. <br/><br/>I won't say this film is for everyone. It IS hard to watch at times. But I'm so glad I did see it. Very cathartic in a way. And trust me, this film couldn't have been done in a more professional, classy way. This feels genuine; of course they are going to 'profit' off it, but you get the sense that the filmmakers and everyone involved poured their hearts into this project and did this to tell a story. A more dignified and heroic story I don't think I've ever seen.",
    "Many people compare \"Once Upon a Time in America\" with \"The Godfather\". In my opinion these two movies can't be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don't compare a Picasso to Michelangelo's Sixteen Chapel either, do you?<br/><br/>What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. <br/><br/>The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut. <br/><br/>The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn't said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.<br/><br/>Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn't left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.<br/><br/>I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.",
    "I have to say I didn't expect this. I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.<br/><br/>The story is about an investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton(Michael Douglas in one of his best roles) who is greedy and self centred and who lives alone in his huge mansion. His brother(Sean Penn) gives him a card telling him to contact the company and it is his birthday present to him. What follows is absolute edge of the seat stuff and it shows David fincher at a time when he made some of the finest movies ever seen in Hollywood. In the midst of all this, he meets a waitress named Christine. Revealing more might spoil the movie for you as it is a fun roller-coaster ride with many twists and turns.<br/><br/>What impressed me about this movie was the atmosphere throughout the movie. It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editing(which is the popular way of making movies today), The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.<br/><br/>I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music. The slow motion sequence at the end is also well done and this has got to be one of the best endings of all time.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.",
    "More thematically compelling and with better action set-pieces, Toy Story 2 is a sequel that is just as good as the original - and one that isn't afraid to go to the more emotional side of storytelling.",
    "The concept of Limitless is fantastic - what would happen if you could take a pill (NZT) that would allow you to use 100% of your brain (instead of the standard 20%) and function on a level higher than you have ever functioned before? The possibilities for such a movie idea are well, limitless - pun intended - but unfortunately, despite some great acting, especially by Bradley Cooper, who plays Eddie Morra - the lead whose life the movie follows throughout it's duration, the film just could not overcome some major plot holes, sloppy writing and nonsensical moments.<br/><br/>LOTS OF SPOILERS...<br/><br/>Many times throughout the film, the script uses PLOT driven storyline instead of CHARACTER driven storyline in order to go from Point A to Point B which the script called for & in the process, didn't make much sense given who the characters were in the picture. Some examples:<br/><br/>1) The movie needed for Eddie to find the NZT stash & money in his Brother in Law's apartment, steal it, get away with it and then take the pill, feel the effects, and use the money to regain his life. Problem? It's absolutely ridiculous to imply that the cops wouldn't have searched him or at the very least patted him down after calling in a murder & going down to the station for questioning. Of course, the huge wad of cash/pills he shoved down the back of his pants would have been found had they searched him so it didn't happen. It's illogical and absolutely ridiculous that he would be able to steal what he did from the apartment, an apartment that he locked himself in when the police initially arrived - and have no issues.<br/><br/>2) The movie needed for the Russian thug to come after Eddie in order to find the NZT, take it and then make trouble for him the entire movie. Problem? It's not believable that super smart Eddie wouldn't remember to pay back the 100k that he borrowed especially when the money was constantly on his mind and he had just made 2 million off of what he borrowed. This is clear cut plot driven over character driven storyline because it's ridiculous for Eddie, the character, to not remember such a basic task, especially when there was direct danger to his life if he forgot.<br/><br/>3) The movie needed for Atwood's lawyer to steal Eddie's stash of pills causing Eddie to spiral out. Problem? Isn't it far fetched to imply that Atwood's henchman killed the woman in the hotel to frame her murder on Eddie at the oft chance that Eddie would retain the same lawyer that worked for Atwood just so he could get close to him to steal his pills for Atwood to save Atwood's life? Huh? How did the henchman/lawyer even know that the pills would be on Eddie to take? They never used to be - the custom suit w/ hidden pocket was something new. He certainly didn't carry them on him back when the woman was initially killed. This whole setup was contrived and made no sense and was based on a lot of coincidences, ones that no one could have predicted.<br/><br/>That is just a few examples of sloppy storytelling. There are also a bunch of basic nit picks that I have like: 1) Why didn't Eddie, who was fearing for his life, buy a gun & train how to use it under the help of NZT? He hires bodyguards and buys a fortress to live in but doesn't purchase a handgun? 2) Why didn't the scientists who made NZT take it themselves in order to use their super smarts to perfect the drug and make it what Eddie's scientists were able to create in the end without the aid of being under the drug's influence? 3) After drinking the Russian's NZT laced blood, why did Eddie lie there on the ground waiting for the henchmen to return so he could poke one in the eye w/ a needle? Why not get out of there? Did we really need that stupid fight scene? 4)Breaking into the safe with a chainsaw in minutes? Impressive 5) Is it really believable that NZT wouldn't have hit the black market and been all over the place?<br/><br/>Lastly - a huge problem I had with Limitless was the happy, Hollywood, contrived Ending. Withdrawal from NZT? Side effects? Once the drug wears off so does the heightened brain activity? No problem - the movie flashes forward 12 months to give Eddie Morra a rainbows, puppies & sunshine like ending where his labs have now created a pill that works like NZT only there are no side effects and the super smart effects are permanent. How nice! He's all happy now & brilliant forever & running for Senate - he's with his girlfriend & their ordering food and look, he's fluent in a foreign language because he's so smart and YUCK. The ending was so over the top in an 'everything worked out in the end' way. I hated it. I didn't need for Eddie to die or crash and burn or anything like that but Limitless took the concept of a happy ending to another level.<br/><br/>Also, with the ending comes a rushed attempt to villanize De Niro's character of Carl Van Loon who out of no where makes a pathetic power play by trying to blackmail Eddie & is quickly shot down. The whole scene between them fell flat for me and felt incredibly sloppy and quickly put together.<br/><br/>Overall, in spite of all the shortcomings, Limitless is still a really good movie. It's thrilling, fast paced and the basic concept is interesting and makes for an entertaining film - you just can't really think about things like logic or else you will be disappointed. 7/10",
    "OK - if you've already seen the movie and hated it, my review won't change your mind, so move along folks, move along, there's nothing to see for you here, thanks.<br/><br/>Now for you, dear film fan, who is about to watch 'The Hateful Eight', but who is now slightly worried because of some very mixed critical reactions - for YOU I'm writing this 100% spoiler-free review.<br/><br/>Judging from many comments here on IMDb and other forums, I gather that many long-time Tarantino fans apparently don't like his newest film. I had feared such a reaction as soon as I had finished watching the movie. It's obviously Tarantino's least accessible effort yet, and there's a number of reasons for that, not the least of which being that this is simply not the film most people expected (or felt they were promised). So if you haven't seen it yet and you're a bit doubtful because of the negative reviews, let me tell you: you'll likely end up loving it - as I did - IF you prepare yourself juuuust a little. And because I really liked the movie, I would like to help you do that via a short list of recommendations. Ready? Here it goes:<br/><br/>1. Don't go watch 'The Hateful Eight' expecting a \"classic\" Western. It might belong to the Western genre, but if all that talk about Ultra 70mm Panavision had you thinking of lush outdoor scenery, vast landscapes or anything resembling a Sergio Leone movie, you'll end up disappointed. There are a few nice shots showing snowy mountains, but 95% (perhaps more) of the story unfolds indoors (in one single room) - which isn't to say that the cinematography isn't absolutely fantastic. In fact, it's more than fantastic: it's stunning and worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>2. Don't expect any exciting \"action\" scenes (for lack of a better word: I don't mean the 'Fast & Furious' kind of action scenes) every 10 minutes or so; in fact, don't expect anything other to happen between the characters than dialog for a loooooong time. Unlike in Tarantino's previous films where we got almost \"spoiled\" by unexpected over-the-top moments in nearly every scene (except maybe for 'Jackie Brown' and 'Deathprooof'), this film has a very, very slow build. But: that's not to say it ISN'T exciting (or that nothing does happen) - it's just that the excitement and tension result mainly from the dialog and the excellent performances by the cast (at least for roughly two thirds of the movie).<br/><br/>3. Best approach this film as you would theater; for that's what 'The Hateful Eight' really is: a stage play disguised as a movie. A stage play of a \"Who-Done-It\" murder mystery with a touch of Agatha Christie. But then again, that's also a disguise, for the murder mystery is just a ploy to cast a look at a torn society rife with racial tension after the civil war. Which, of course, again serves as an allegory for race relations in modern-day America and as the director's angry commentary on how hateful that situation still is today, on all sides. Now that sounds awfully serious, but don't worry; despite some hard-to-stomach ugliness and the highly political undercurrent, there is plenty of Tarantino's trademark humor throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>4. Don't expect to find a likable character you can root for. There's a reason for the film's title, and unlike in all his previous films, there is not a single person in Tarantino's latest movie you'll feel any real sympathy for. All the main characters have committed despicable, hateful acts, and they're all beyond redemption - but that doesn't mean they're not compelling to watch (especially given THIS cast: everyone is fantastic, but Jackson, Russell, Jason Leigh and Goggins are just a joy to watch).<br/><br/>5. Don't expect a complex plot. In my opinion, among Q.T's films this is the one with the most straight forward and most simple plot to date, yet at the same time it's arguably his most complex - and most ambitious - film.<br/><br/>So, dear film fan, that's it: adhere to these here 5 \"commandments\", and there's a big chance you'll end up loving Mr. Banana Chin's latest oeuvre as much as I did (mind; you might love the film just as much without taking any of the above advice). I admit, it took me a while to get into this dialog-heavy stage play and would-be Western, but once I did, I never looked back (and I can hardly wait to watch it again). 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",
    "Many people say the cried at the end of this movie... Huh! Knowing the plot already, I (a grown up man) can barely hold my tears from the very beginning whenever I watch it. Much more than just a \"cute and sad fairy tale\", this movie is a true piece of art. This is one of those rarest cases when a bunch of talented and truly, but truly dedicated people set out to create something beautiful, some chemistry occurs and ... a miracle happens. Fortunately for all of us, this miracle immortalized on film.<br/><br/>Throughout the human history, the wisdom of generation was conveyed through fairy tales. This tale is no exception. This story, told in magic simplicity, actually has some deep philosophical meanings. While mercilessly debunking the true nature of human beings, this tragic story really tears your heart, and yet it fills it with hope. That is the true and, perhaps, the only purpose of art, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Why do we need music, painting, theatre, poetry? Is there a real excuse for their existence? To me, the only purpose, the only excuse is to help people go on, to give them hope. And it's well worth it!<br/><br/>To sum up, easily Tim Burton's best, this film is a masterpiece, my favorite American movie, and probably one of the best movies of all times. 10/10",
    "I have been waiting for the right time to review this film. I did not feel until today that I was truly ready to say all I had to say about director Rob Reiner's unforgettable staple of 1980s pop culture. When I first saw The Princess Bride, I was only 7 years old, and hardly cognizant of film as anything but a pastime. While I remember the movie as being enjoyable, I did not have anywhere near as strong a liking or appreciation for it as I do now. I certainly did not remember the film as a theater-going experience, and recently, I got the chance to view it, on the big screen, with at least fifty others in attendance at a midnight screening.<br/><br/>Personally, I am one of those people who, by nature, absorbs memorable quotes, and by that token, the entirety of The Princess Bride is fair game. As I sat there watching, I could always hear somebody, if not more than one person, at least whispering along with the movie under his or her breath. Meanwhile, I noticed that there was a wide disparity of age groups. There were pre-teens, teens, people in their twenties, thirties, and some that looked well past forty. If the showing had not been at midnight, I do not doubt that there would have been pre-pre-teens as well.<br/><br/>With a screenplay written by William Goldman (based on his book), The Princess Bride is a classic, familiar story of a princess, her true love, and the forces that come between them. As is evidenced by those in attendance, this is a story for all ages. The manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by Goldman and Reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film. As any fan of the movie will tell you, however, it is the film's whimsical, irreverent, pervasive tongue-in-cheek antics that make it an unqualified masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you hang around people who love this film, do not be surprised if they react to unbelievable situations with the exclamation, \"Inconceivable!\" Likewise, if you tell them to just wait a minute, don't be thrown aback when they suddenly sport a Spanish accent in saying, \"I hate waiting.\" And if you suddenly, from out of nowhere, hear, \"Hello.my name is Inigo Montoya.you killed my father.prepare to die,\" don't worry. It's not your fault, and you're not going to die.<br/><br/>While The Princess Bride has the sort of satirical edge more geared towards adults, the film is equally effective as a pure fairytale, and for this reason, there is a little something for everyone. In addition, the film enacts a self-referential tribute to the power and beauty of fairytale stories, even in the current age in which many consider them archaic and obsolete.<br/><br/>A sick grandson (Fred Savage), who is spending his time mindlessly playing video games (of the nostalgic Atari 8-bit type), gets a visit from his grandfather (portrayed through a wonderful performance from Peter Falk). To the grandson's dismay, his elder has brought a book to read to him. When he expresses disapproval at his grandfather's old-fashioned ways, the grandfather's response is, \"When I was your age, television was called books.\" Even this quote stands out as resonant and memorable.<br/><br/>The grandson starts out expressing skepticism and boredom, but of course, as the reading of the story progresses, this gradually gives way to captivation and praise. Buttercup (Robin Wright, in her breakthrough role) is a fair-haired, stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged to the smug, cowardly Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), the prince who rules over the land of Florin. She of course does not love him, and she has been without joy since her true love, a farm boy named Wesley (Cary Elwes), was reportedly murdered on the seas.<br/><br/>Of course, without Wesley, there is no story of true love, and we know that he must miraculously return to her someday. This happens through an extraordinary, and increasingly hilarious, set of circumstances. A group of three bandits kidnap Buttercup with the intent of killing her to precipitate a war between Florin and its enemy, Guilder. These three are (in order of increasing stature) the intellectually pompous Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), the Spanish swordsman Inigo (Mandy Patinkin), and the big-hearted slow-witted giant Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant, in one of the most no-brainer casting decisions in all of film history).<br/><br/>During the kidnapping, however, a mysterious man in black closes in on the trail of the three abductors, and it is this man who takes on each of the three one by one in battles of skill, strength, smarts, and of course, deliciously witty repartee. There is something unusually extraordinary about these battles, however.<br/><br/>With the exception of Vezzini, the abductors are not villains as we might initially perceive them to be. The marvelously choreographed swordplay between the man in black and Inigo, and the hilarious absurdity of the handfight with Fezzik, are not at all about winning or losing. They embody a sense of honor, sportsmanship, and nobility that is rarely exemplified in competition (both fictional and real).<br/><br/>Inigo, Fezzik, and the man in black do not display their skills pretentiously or flauntingly. Instead, they take a strong sense of inner pride in the subtle mastery of their arts. As a result, when we see them engage in competition, there is not a sense of enmity, but a wonderful air of camaraderie.<br/><br/>Also included in the mix are a sadistic count (Christopher Guest) with an odd physical characteristic and a penchant for pain, an albino (Mel Smith) with a stuffy throat, the deadly wrath of an R.O.U.S., and a clergyman (Peter Cook) who makes Elmer Fudd seem eloquently spoken. Most memorable, perhaps, is the appearance of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the miracle-man Max and his wife. It has been reported that in the middle of filming this scene, Reiner was forced to leave the set, because Crystal's improvisations were causing him to laugh to the point of being sick.<br/><br/>Regarding the film's casting, every single choice, without exception, is absolute perfection. Cary Elwes not only easily looks the part of a daring, ingenious hero, but as an actor, he has an incredible gift for a subtle mixture of drama and comedy, one that easily coincides with the film's sensibilities. Robin Wright easily essays the role of the headstrong princess, endlessly devoted to her love (with a convincing British accent, despite her American origins).<br/><br/>For the scene of swordplay, Elwes and Patinkin had to study fencing for months, which is impressive, but on-screen, I had no trouble believing that they were characters who had studied for at least several years. Despite his limited acting ability, wrestler Andre the Giant is perfect for the role of Fezzik, and something would be lost with any other actor in his place. And of course, Wallace Shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the diminutive, perpetually exasperated Vezzini.<br/><br/>We also don't have to hear Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon speak any lines to know they are portraying villains. The arrogance, callousness, and sliminess are readily apparent in their facial and bodily expressions.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, we have witnessed a wide variety of hilarity, captivating acts of love and heroism, and of course, one of the most satisfying acts of retribution ever put on film (one that immortalizes the film's most famous quote and chooses just the right time and placement for the film's sole swear word).<br/><br/>For someone who watches this film for the first time, and quickly catches on to the film's capricious mix of reverence and satire, the film is a marvel to watch simply for the knowledge that you do not know what will come next. Will there be a touching moment? A reflective one? An act of bravado? Or will our expectations be subverted in an act of comical subterfuge? The answer: any of them will do, as the film has a delectable variety of all of them.<br/><br/>From start to finish, The Princess Bride is a transcendent, magical experience that constantly elicits uproarious laughter and simultaneously immerses the audience in a rich, magnificent, and almost nostalgic world of folklore that, after the end credits roll, seems timeless and undying. In the years since its release in 1987, it has grown into a cult film of legendary status, and judging by the wide variety of ages I witnessed at the screening (as well as the endless barrage of quoting), it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that the film will endure for many years to come.",
    "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) is more than a sequel to a cult classic film from The Evil Dead (1981) this film is more of a prequel to the Army of Darkness (1992) that was made 5. years later. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is my number 1 favorite film best Evil Dead movie in the franchise. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I love this film to death and I love it so damn much. I enjoy this film a lot, it is one of my favorite movie's in the trilogy. <br/><br/>This is a great movie fun gory entertaining kick-ass sequel. It has action, comedy and horror mixed together that is why I love this film to death! Bruce Campbell is pure fun bad-ass Ash I absolutely love him in this sequel. I miss the 80's and that really best action gory movies un like they are today.<br/><br/>This sequel to the original movie is the perfect balance between the horror of the original and the silliness of the third installment. It succeeds because it has fun with the \"B\" movie genre, never claiming to be better than it is while employing witty direction and dialogue. The scene I remember most is when blood splashes on the lightbulb, making the room glow red. <br/><br/>The first time I watch it, this film really confused me a lot because I thought it was sequel to The Evil Dead but it had a lot of changes, which I love that. I have enjoyed a lot of this film, it is one of my second favorite movie's of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is pure fun and it's witty. Don't get me wrong I love both of Evil Dead films, but I just prefer Army of Darkness more, because it has funny scenes and it has a happy ending, those two films doesn't have happy endings, that is why I love Army of Darkness much better. The film it is just more of the same thing. Literally. But don't take that as such a negative thing. With the success of the low-budget original under his belt, director Sam Raimi re-imagined his first draft and added many elements he just did not have either the time or the money to accomplish on the first pass. On some level, the film certainly works as a nightmare that has to be replayed by our poor reluctant hero Ash. second Evil pairing of writer-director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell doesn't pick up from where the first Evil Dead left off, it instead reinvents some of the same characters from the first film, notably Campbell's daffy hero Ash and putative girlfriend Linda (played by Denise Bixler in this film), and plops them back in the same basic plot setup as the first film, in a kind of horror-comedy Groundhog Day scenario.<br/><br/>Once again Ash visits an isolated cabin in the woods, turns on a tape recorder that has a professor spouting verbiage from the Necronomicon, and the next thing you know, all hell has broken loose, quite literally. Raimi is a director who may not win points for finesse, but he works in a manic, breathless style that is perfectly suited for the outré black comedy of the Evil Dead franchise, and that devil may care, throw caution to the wind spirit is what has made the Evil Dead trilogy (Army of Darkness was the third film, though there's evidently a Raimi-Campbell remake of the original Evil Dead in the offing) such a cult sensation and what continues to draw audiences to the films to this day. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is an extremely gruesome affair, but it's also laugh out loud hilarious a lot of the time, with Campbell's intentionally arch delivery and wide-eyed crazed, cartoonish performance style making the most of Raimi and co-scenarist Scott Speigel's reinvention of the Evil Dead premise. <br/><br/>Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is really a sly, if sometimes sinister, comedy, one blacker than, well, death, but which delivers some consistent guffaws mixed in with the more typical \"avert your eyes\" blood and guts.<br/><br/>Ash (Bruce Campbell), the sole survivor of THE EVIL DEAD, returns to the same cabin in the woods and again unleashes the forces of the dead. With his girlfriend possessed by the demons and his body parts running amok, Ash is forced to single- handedly battle the legions of the damned as the most lethal - and groovy - hero in horror movie history! Welcome to EVIL DEAD II, director Sam Raimi's infamous sequel to THE EVIL DEAD and outrageous prequel to ARMY OF DARKNESS!<br/><br/>Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is a 1987 American horror comedy film directed by Sam Raimi and a parody sequel to the 1981 film The Evil Dead. The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration Crimewave), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.<br/><br/>I love this film and Army of Darkness!!!!",
    "William Shakespeare's famous tragedy is brought to the screen on a large scale. Full of his intricate and unique style of writing, this play focuses on Macbeth.\n....\nWhat I did not expect to see is that the landscape of Scotland becomes not just the scenery background but one of the main storytelling streams. One sees too many modern adaptations of Japanese interpretation of Macbeth that one seems to forget where the story came from in the first place. Truly magnificent cinematography in this version of Macbeth and it really lives up to bloodbath on the battlefields as stated in the Bard' s words. One of the best movies in 2015",
    "Completely brilliant. This film is amazing in its characterization, its pacing, its character development and its visuals.\nThe book is superb, but Stanley is a genius who has a midas touch.<br/><br/>Glory glory violence.",
    "I was reluctant to see this movie. As a veteran of Desert Shield/Storm, I spent my first 90 days in-theater in the Weapons Co of A Swofford's Battalion. I later was moved to the 1st Bn of 7th Marines, but having been in the same unit for some of the same time I felt I could offer readers a unique perspective on the film's accuracy.<br/><br/>From a purely aesthetic perspective I thought the film was well done. The acting was very good, and the script was well written, witty, and accurate. The actors were well suited to their roles. My personal preference for a good plot would have been disappointed were it not for my personal interest in the film. In my opinion this film is an outstanding dramatic-documentary, so adjust your expectations accordingly. If you are expecting a driving plot line and all the accompanying dramatic tension, then I think you will be disappointed (as many whose comments I heard exiting the theater certainly were). But if you think of it as a chance to take a glimpse into a point in history, and see it as some of those who lived it did, then I think you will be impressed.<br/><br/>Many people may think that the obscenity of some of the interactions was overdone for effect. But whatever anyone's personal judgment of that behavior, that is the closest portrayal of Marines (or soldiers) being themselves I have yet seen on screen. Marines are vulgar. They do watch porn. They do fight among themselves. They do both hate, and love, the Marine Corps. There is an omni-present anti-war conspiracy theorist. The do say ridiculous things. There are some who are over the line. The reality of the Marine Infantry is that things happen there every day that are well beyond conventional sensibility, and which strain credibility to the average civilian. It's all true. I love the Marine Corps and I am still serving - I don't have an axe to grind. It just happens to be true.<br/><br/>Are there parts of the film that I find incredible? Yes. But they are not the essential things. There is a scene, it's even in the trailer, in which everyone is firing their weapon into the air. I wasn't there, but I can't fathom a breach of discipline on that scale. I can't say it's impossible, but I am doubtful. But whether it's true or not is not important. At its essence this is a film about Marines, how they adjusted to the Marine Corps, each other, and a war. If there are a few incredible details, then we can just be grateful that Hollywood didn't impose a car-chase on us.<br/><br/>This is a film about Marines. At that time, there were very few who turned down scholarships to Ivy League schools to come in. We were from strange backgrounds. We were obscene. We did want to get our kills. Many of us were frustrated that our war was only 100 hrs long. We knew we were filling the footsteps of giants - the Marines of Iwo, The Chosin, Belleau Wood - and I think we all wanted a chance to earn a place next to those men. In our wild, adrenalized youth, those aspirations just took the crude form of looking for a kill. Or at least that's how I've put it in perspective 15 years later.<br/><br/>If you go and see this film, try to recall yourself at 18 (as I was). Suspend your judgment of the obscenity and vulgarity until you're sure you would've done it differently. I can't speak for Swofford, but I am still incredibly proud of my service there. The insanity of this film reminds me why: because it is characteristic of the immense hardship that our youth bears on behalf of the rest. Do the characters look stressed? It's not hyperbole. We were 18 and we thought we were going to die over there. Still, at H-Hour, everyone marched North. In my opinion, you better fill some big shoes before you judge that. <br/><br/>So don't go into this film champing at the bit to pigeon-hole it as \"Anti\" or \"Pro\" war, with all the pre-fab rhetoric that comes with such a judgment. You have an opportunity here to look back into our little moment in history. Swofford has invited you into our memories. They are not Right, and they are not Left, they are just our story as Swofford lived it. If that kind of thing interests you, then go and see this movie.",
    "As a huge Woody Allen fan, I was delighted and surprised by this film.  I have scarcely heard anyone mention it, but for my money it is the single most comically dense of all of Woody's films.  There are so many truly impressive/hilarious/memorable one-liners that I'm amazed people don't quote this movie left and right. The setting, costumes, accents all add to the hilarity of the film--truly reminiscent of a Marx Brothers romp.  Really outstanding among his pre-Annie Hall films.  Only rivaled by Bananas in my opinion for simple laugh value.<br/><br/>Unlike any other of his films, this deals with his \"deep\" questions of death/metaphysics in an unflaggingly light and comical fashion.  For instance:<br/><br/>Sonja: But judgment of any system or a priori relation of phenomena exists in any rational or metaphysical or at least epistemological contradiction to an abstracted empirical concept such as being or to be or to occur in the thing itself or of the thing itself.<br/><br/>Boris: Yeah, I've said that many times.<br/><br/>Not Woody's \"best\" film (see Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanors), but perhaps his most laugh-filled. Satisfying throughout.  I give it a 9/10.",
    "I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.<br/><br/>It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.<br/><br/>Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). <br/><br/>What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).<br/><br/>So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/",
    "Caution: spoilers may abound. I think this movie is severely underrated. Most complaints I see are of people who can't let go of the vision of superman they got from Christopher reeve who played a superman who was a god among men who never made mistakes and always knew what to do. That's not someone we relate to in this day and age because in our cynical and jaded society it's impossible to be that morally upright. I like Henry Cavill's superman because he plays a man who has to learn how to be superman. He's not perfect out the gate and he doesn't automatically know how to handle every situation right out the gate. Because of this a lot of lives are lost in the battle of metropolis and superman is forced to end zod because there is no other recourse because there is no way to contain him on earth with all the kryptonian tech is destroyed. Whatever you can say about how believable it is that superman didn't have a choice it's still set up well. Krypton was very beautiful and Russell Crowe made a great jor el. As far as the plot for the movie I understand the criticism that the flashbacks don't make sense but I think the death of Jonathan Kent is done very well because it's a sacrifice intended to keep Clark undercover. All in all its not perfect but it's far from terrible.",
    "I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this one isn't even in the TOP 100.<br/><br/>This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:<br/><br/>-The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.<br/><br/>-The Emperor was Finally Revealled: Well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw The Emperor as kids.<br/><br/>-The Speeder Bike Chase: Alright, so this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!<br/><br/>-The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Moment)<br/><br/>-The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.<br/><br/>All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story.",
    "How do I start? I love this film! It has a great plot line and incredible music. It is a fun musical that makes you want to get up and dance.<br/><br/>Grease is the story of Danny Zucko and Sandy Olsen (or Dumbruski) two high school seniors who fall in love over the summer. They have a wonderful summer together and are sad to see it end. The first day of school arrives and little does Danny know him and Sandy would soon be reunited. But Sandy is shocked to find the nice guy she meet at the beach is the leader of a greaser gang called 'The T'birds' Meanwhile Sandy is trying to fit in with her new \"friends\" the T'birds female counterparts The Pink Ladies. Will Sandy and Danny ever be together again? Along with this plot comes song that will be stuck in your head for centuries. Such songs include Summer Nights, Beauty School Dropout and the now famous song Greased Lightining. Grease is a timeless classic that will have you singing and dancing by the end of the movie.",
    "I loved this movie, it's so funny :D one of the best comedy movies ever!!! It has (like many movies) a message, that it's best to tell the truth, but above all it was very funny. My favorite scene was: <br/><br/>About Mr. Allen <br/><br/>Miranda: Well, what do you think of him? Fletcher: He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless steaming pile of cow dung, figuratively speaking. a moment passes and Mr. Allen starts laughing. The other board members follow his lead and start laughing also] Mr. Allen: That's the funniest damn thing I have ever heard. You're a real card, Reede. I love a good roast. Do Simmons. Fletcher: Simmons is old. He should have been out of the game years ago but he can't stay home because he hates his wife. You have met her at the Christmas parties, she's the one that gets plastered and calls him a retard, and you, Tom; you're the biggest brown nose I have ever seen. You have got your head so far up Mr. Allen's ass, I can't tell where you end and he begins. Mr. Allen: *roaring with laughter* Priceless! *Fletcher continues with every member* Fletcher: You have bad breath caused by gingivitis. You couldn't get a porn star off. Your hairpiece looks like something that was killed crossing the highway. I don't know whether to comb it or scrape it off with a shovel and bury it in lime. Loser! Idiot! Wimp! Degenerate! *Slut*! Mr. Allen: I like your style, Reede! That's just what this stuffy company needs - a little irreverence! Fletcher: Good! I'll see you later, dick-head! <br/><br/>Great movie!!!",
    "Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as \"Sergeant Major Dickerson\",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.",
    "Overall I enjoyed the movie. There have been too many recent films about the Tudors and Elizabeth in particular, but this film looks good and it keeps you entertained. It's set at the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Elizabeth is shown as tough, smart, and married to her country. She also suffers from bouts of insecurity and irrational jealousies. This film is more hagiographic and melodramatic than its predecessor. <br/><br/>The film tends to ignore the facts when they get in the way of the story. Elizabeth was 55 at the time of the Spanish Armada and she was never a looker. Blanchett's Queen is youngish and attractive. Blanchett's acting performance is powerful and impressive but also a bit stagy. The way the politics of the time are depicted is a bit too black and white. The Spanish look grim and are dressed in dark colors. They are portrayed as crazy, religious zealots. Spain had a right to be upset at English privateers / pirates who attacked their ships and stole their gold. Mary, Queen of Scots is shown as a dowdy, schemer who disliked Elizabeth. The reality was that Mary was a pretty bimbo who made bad choices when it came to men.<br/><br/>Parts of the film veer too much towards soap-opera. Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen)becomes a favorite, but when Bess Throckmorton, one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting and Raleigh get secretly married, Elizabeth becomes jealous and behaves badly. Later, Raleigh and Francis Drake are shown defeating the Spanish at sea. In reality Raleigh was looking after the coastal defenses in the South West of England and didn't marry Throckmorton until 1591. The real Raleigh was a brilliant man: soldier, explorer, writer, poet and courtier and probably deserves his own film. The film is good fun but it's simplistic, cartoon history.",
    "I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was simply delighted.<br/><br/>I saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie, but then found it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started trying to justify liking this flick on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going way overboard: the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man; (b) the extensive male-female humor arising out of that basic conceit; and (c) some of the names (including Viola & Duke).<br/><br/>Aside from those names, the thematic commonalties (a & b) are really great themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. Beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary/traditional teen flick. And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like alluding to Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The movie is bright, fast-paced, emotive, stylized, funny ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and male/female humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part IMHO: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing over-the-top fun. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately, with such a complexity of invention that I'm still a little bewildered ... but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard, it's not that kind of a movie: things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next split-second happening.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes really is just delightful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke; David Cross does a wonderfully over the top Principal Gold. All of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. Cinematography was excellent.<br/><br/>Wonderful entertainment from beginning to end ... check it out!",
    "Gravity is a wonderful work of art. Cuaron and Lubezki are at their visual storytelling bests, which is quite a statement. The shots of outer space are long and gorgeous, and the sound design is impeccable, both encompassing the vastness and silence of space as well as letting us see Ryan's perspective. The grounded, careful science of the film and the exceptional effects and camera work give us a sense of what space is like - a tall order. What brings Gravity to the next level is the level of personal connection we reach with Kowalski, and especially Ryan. I felt nervous and scared every time Ryan was faced with a seemingly impossible situation. It is so impressive that Cuaron could get us to connect with Ryan and make every moment so thrilling despite having next to no dialogue and only having two characters in the whole film! The scene where Kowalski returns and enters the shuttle was far and away the scene of the movie for me, especially as it hit me that it was in her mind. The score is effective in heightening tension. Gravity is a groundbreaking work of art that, despite its narrow focus on just Ryan's journey, he manages to both amaze us visually and thrill us, start to finish.",
    "Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original \"Willy Wonka\" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",
    "My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.<br/><br/>\nFor someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:\n<ul><li>Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.</li><li>The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular \"Nolan's spirit\" in it.</li><li>The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.</li><li>Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.</li><li>Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/>\nSPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!<br/><br/>It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - \"extractors\" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of steeling, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called \"inception\". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels \"dream within a dream\", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.<br/><br/>The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.<br/><br/>\nSome short lines about the cast:\n<ul><li>Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.</li><li>Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).</li><li>There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...</li><li>Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.</li><li>Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.</li><li>Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.</li><li>Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.</li></ul>",
    "Even before the final credits rolled, I strongly suspected this movie would end up on my Top 20; in fact, perhaps even my Top 10. A teenage boy, his hearing impaired from having just been at the site of a bombing, and a young woman clutching at him, the two of them stumbling and sludging through a slimy, smelly bog. A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don't need vast, elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers' comments on the movie, it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most \"satisfying\". A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn't really get going until the second half. For me, it was the first half that got under my skin the most, for its cinematic originality, poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement, but it's only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman, defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also, never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed, and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema, rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn't always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See, rape is shown as nothing but pure, unadulterated, hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial, external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film, you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars. <br/><br/>On another subject, whoever thinks this movie contains \"propaganda\" is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it's a Soviet production, and should think things over a little more carefully. It's astonishing how you can still find little traces of the Cold War mentality surviving to this day, even in younger viewers... The fact that as detractors of Come and See claim, Stalin \"was no better than Hitler\" has nothing to do with anything at all, in this movie's context - Klimov's picture is NOT about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant - it's about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war - ANY war, though this one happened to be going on in Bielorussia. There was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan than the whole of Come and See. This is painful, sublime cinema. I've always believed there's something special about Russians when it comes to producing art, especially literature - this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression in me.",
    "Like many of you, the first time I saw the trailer for The Lego Movie (2014) I thought to myself, \"Are you kidding me?!\" Yet another movie based on a franchise of toys aimed towards families willing to cough up the cash just to shut their kids up. Can't we for once make movies for kids that don't dull the senses? Have we truly come to the point where there are no original thoughts? Yet after seeing not just families but college kids' line up to see sold out viewings I became interested. In addition, The Lego Movie managed to muster a staggering 93% on rottentomatoes.com, an unheard of fresh score in the February film graveyard. In short; curiosity got the best of me.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong about this film. I honestly couldn't have been more wrong about a film in my life. The Lego Movie is not only the must see film of the late winter season, I'm going to go ahead and call it now; it's the best family-oriented film for all ages of 2014. Okay maybe not but at the very least it's a very high bar to set.<br/><br/>The story busts out of the gate from the get-go; Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) a wizard and \"master builder\", while protecting a mystery weapon is blinded by Lord Business (Will Ferrell), obviously our caped and big booted villain. Before Vitruvius is kicked into the abyss by Business and his robotic minions, he foretells of a hero, the \"special\" who will put an end to his dastardly plans, whatever they might be. The next morning Emmet a seemingly ordinary Lego construction worker goes about his normal day. He comes across a woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for \"the piece of resistance\" which he unwittingly finds and becomes beholden to. Now it's up to Emmet and some newfound friends to fulfill the prophecy.<br/><br/>It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. Yet within The Lego Movie's brick-blocked world, everything including the story feels incredibly new and original. Children, especially the young will enjoy the fast action, laugh-a-minute jokes, sly slapstick and goofy characters. Obvious kid favorites will include perma-smiled Unikitty (Alison Brie) and zany 80's throwback astronaut Benny (Charlie Day) whose ability to create spaceships is frustratingly overlooked. Plus there's Batman (Will Arnett)Batman! <br/><br/>The older crowd however will be astounded not only with the seamless CGI effects but with the subversive element throughout the film. Yes a goofy, kiddy film of such unrestrained chirpiness can be positively incendiary, at least in this case. Throughout the film there are Orwellian elements tucked underneath crafty pop-culture references ranging from Star Wars (1977) to Harry Potter. There are mischievous pokes at what Henry David Thoreau referred to as \"(leading) lives of quite desperation.\" <br/><br/>Finally there's cheeky satire aimed at the Danish toy brand itself. Much of the conflict revolves around \"master builders\" who build whatever they want out of the parts they find versus Lord Business who wants everything built \"according to the directions.\" This particular theme struck the kid inside me as I was very fond of Legos. Younglings may not realize that back in the day, pre-designed Lego play sets took a back seat to the now impossible to find Lego Creative Bucket sets. To the uninitiated that particular red bucket set was an amalgam of potential foot sores but to this writer, those 200+ pieces were a gateway to an unlimited creative space.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie accurately and effectively recreates that creative space through accessible movie magic. It exhibits a fun hero story that may not be treading new narrative ground but nonetheless feels fresh and new. Finally the themes and occasionally biting humor makes The Lego Movie a kid's film that isn't just for kids but the child in all of us. This February do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an adventure story unlike any other. Then go home and order some Legos online! I know I am.",
    "First of all, it is an Adam Sandler movie. If you hate Adam Sandler movies, then you won't like this.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8/10 because it was one of the better Adam Sandler movies. The plot and storyline was better than I expected; the development was pretty good as well. There were definitely a lot of points where I had to slap my forehead b/c it was silly funny.<br/><br/>Yeah, its highly unrealistic, but if you expected realism, whats wrong with you? Sure, Jennifer Anniston is the \"uglier chick,\" which is like saying a million dollars isn't that much money, but she did a good job in the movie.<br/><br/>The only complaint I had was Adam Sandler used all the lines I planned on using with the girl I took to see it!",
    "I'll start this off with a warning. If you're a mainstream horror fan, you will not like this. It is not The Conjuring, it does not have jump scares, it is a slow movie. It's not scary in the way that most horror films are scary. It doesn't frighten you. It felt traumatic. This is an artsy movie for sure. If you don't like that, don't see it.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh is absolutely phenomenal. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invensted in such a disturbing film. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunningly gorgeous. I've never seen a film look so gory and grotesque and yet absolutely beatiful at the same time. It's some of the best cinematography that I've seen in years. The art direction is also phenomenal in providing us with a floral, candy colored, nightmare world.<br/><br/>And Ari Aster's screenplay and direction is what makes this so special and separates it from other horror pieces. It's slow, methodical, eerie. But the characters are psychological and deep. The dialogue is real and colorful. The plot is surreal and disturbing. He let's the scares crawl at you as opposed to jump at you. He allows you to see what will happen, process it, feel the shock of what's about to happen, and then still shock you even more when it happens.<br/><br/>This film will be divisive. I have no doubt that many people here will hate this. However, while this is a challenging film, it's also a great film. Halfway through a character says something along the lines of \"That was so messed up, but I'm trying to keep an open mind.\" I suggest that audiences take this advice.<br/><br/>PSA, this movie is extremely violent, bloody, and gory. It's pretty horrifying and it could have stuff that is triggering.",
    "I can believe this movie will be a serious disappointment for a person, who is used to and likes to watch Hollywood war movies. Four reasons: 1. It's made in a world, where movie makers tries to have some personality. If you think 'When We Were Soldiers'... well, there are hundreds of directors who you can imagine making a similar war movie with personality and values of a hamburger.<br/><br/>2. Screenplay has a different structure. There's no shocking opening scene like in 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie starts slowly in a very nice place and ends slowly in a very bad place, without hope or feeling that the characters have achieved something by their heroic actions.<br/><br/>3. It is first a movie about lost causes in the world of war, and only secondly a war movie which takes place in Stalingrad.<br/><br/>4. War scenes portray the horror, insecurity and confusion of a battle, instead of how cool, heroic and exciting fighting looks like. In this sense, this movie is closer to reality than most of the war movies you will ever see. 'Thin Red Line' also had similar \"I would probably crap in my pants in that situation\"-feeling.<br/><br/>Stalingrad, whether you think it as a movie or a war movie has so many good things in it... like honesty. Even the ordinary German soldiers were dreaming about farms in Russia when they were advancing. What a disappointment they must have had in Stalingrad! If you like to watch war movies, meaning also other war movies than When We Were Soldiers or Saving Private Ryan, you should see this one. (9/10)",
    "I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like \"Mr. Woodcock\" and \"Good Luck Chuck,\" movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.<br/><br/>\"Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!\" <br/><br/>\"He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!\" <br/><br/>No. Die.<br/><br/>Knocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with. Needless to say, he's the reason the movie works.",
    "I've watched this film for the third time in a few years last night. Instead of writing a straight review, I'd like to jot down ten thoughts just off the top of my head concerning this exquisite movie: <br/><br/>1) Watching this film will change forever your perception of the bank heist genre, making you question the contrived cinematic conventions these films usually make use of.<br/><br/>2) The source of this film's paradoxical and/or farcical elements spring from life itself, not from film or pre-existing cinematic conventions. Sometimes, the absurdities of life are so great, they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point, this film captures that concept beautifully. <br/><br/>3) Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time, even, in hardly making an issue out of it at all - it just IS. <br/><br/>4) It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober, you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.<br/><br/>5) Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero, with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash, bloated, childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.<br/><br/>6) Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. **SPOILERS**: Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car, where he doesn't say a word, but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie; you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live! <br/><br/>7) Watching this film, you'll realise that firing a gun-shot is a BIG DEAL in real life, and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way. <br/><br/>8) All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move away you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way. <br/><br/>9) No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness, inspiration and talent. <br/><br/>10) Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive film-making as it did first time round.",
    "I'm finding it hard to see why this film has taken such a tongue lashing (or keyboard lashing) by some people...<br/><br/>mostly it is said that the main character is selfish and self indulgent, and that this film builds him up to be some kind of hero..<br/><br/>but I think that's missing the point...<br/><br/>through-out I was thinking about how, on one hand it was admirable that he wanted to break from the materialistic, money grabbing oppressive shackles placed on us by modern society, but on the other, how he had gone about it in such an irresponsible, hurtful and self-righteous way...<br/><br/>the way he abandoned his parents and loving sister without a phone call note or explanation, and from the people he met along the way, like the kind old man and young romance, especially compounded this...<br/><br/>and ultimately he realised this at the end by scribbling into a book, \"happiness only real when shared\" surely that is the lesson here! that his selfish, hurtful adolescent behaviour was wrong, and he ultimately paid a terrible cost.<br/><br/>So ignore that haters...they are looking at this story the wrong way! Very much worth an open minded viewing!",
    "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \"Scarface\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \"American Dream\".<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about the \"cheesiness\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.<br/><br/>This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.<br/><br/>The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.<br/><br/>Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \"Scarface\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",
    "Because I lived in Sierra Leone, in fact in Kono, the diamond-mining area of the country, for three years, I had to see Blood Diamond as soon as it came out. It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio's performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I've ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. This movie just gets so many things right that the few places it departs from reality are entirely forgivable. I would heartily recommend this movie to everyone; it is the best Hollywood movie I've seen in years.",
    "I found myself really enjoying SULTAN. Ali knows how to push all the right buttons to keep the audience engaged. Ali's writing and directing are flawless. This is without a doubt Ali's best ever movie. Nushki is an acting diva and she is making her way to be the next great actress since Aishwarya Rai. I love love love Nushki, I truly adore her and always will. She's my love ;) xxx I must confess that I could watch Nushki in almost anything, but here she really delivers a performance that may be her best yet . . . and I've seen almost all of her work. Nushki elevates herself to a league of her own. She is a beautiful girl who is talented enough when playing \"regular\" characters, such as the journalist in \"PK\". But as a high profile corporate executive in \"NH10\" and in this film as a musclebound wrestler, she takes it to a level most female actors couldn't. You can tell how hard she worked to make this role believable because when she wrestles you forget it is Anushka Sharma in the ring. SK is always a pleasure to watch. Here his character's sizzling chemistry with Nushki is completely adorable and that moments of sweetness will surely MELT your heart. SK gives an incredible performance that will undoubtedly propel his career. Overall it is one motion picture that should never be missed nor put aside when selecting movies to be seen on a weekend. SULTAN is a sure winner for all.",
    "`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.<br/><br/>And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.<br/><br/>Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.<br/><br/>The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.<br/><br/>O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",
    "This film is the equivalent to a sixteen year old, fairly privileged middle class boy, who has a baseball cap, curtains and t-shirt with the marijuana leaf on it yet has only ever smoked one spliff and made a huge deal about it. He thinks that smoking weed makes him relevant. So he needs to let everyone know he does it because there's nothing else that will appeal about him. Because he doesn't want to come off as a nerd, he lowers his intelligence and because he is too 'dumb' to actually be funny, he swears every 10 seconds to constitute humour. Possibly still faps over that one single poster of a tanned girl in a bikini that his Uncle bought him on his birthday because he was 'becoming a man, bro.'<br/><br/>It was described to my boyfriend as 'offensive'. It wasn't. It's vulgar. It's not even the funny kind.<br/><br/>I watched it last night with my boyfriend. Only us and a group of three 'lads' were in the cinema. Understand, we all laughed more during the adverts and trailers than we did the actual movie.<br/><br/>Within the first five minutes, I was embarrassed that I subjected my boyfriend and I to this and knew it was going to disappoint me.<br/><br/>Immediately, you're met with profanity. Now, once or twice to give the impression that hot dogs swear is fine. Swearing so much to substitute for lack of humour is just pathetic. Amidst the language, nothing funny was said. That's bad writing.<br/><br/>There's the joke that hot dogs are having sex with buns when they're put into the buns. That makes sense as a joke. It's a safe bet. This would have been modestly funny had it not been repeated throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Yes, we get it. The sausage is a phallic shape and goes into a bun.<br/><br/>It really puts it to you within the first few minutes. A pack of sausages shaming each other about their size and shape. (BECAUSE THEY ARE METAPHORICAL PENISES DON'T YOU KNOW! HAR HAR!) Again though, not funny or clever. Then courting the lady-buns by being vulgar. Sausage calls bun a b***h.<br/><br/>It was clear that I'd sat us down for an uninspired and lazy flop.<br/><br/>I laughed modestly twice. I laughed out of obligation and embarrassment about 5 times.<br/><br/>There were a few clever bits. I am a fan of wordplay, so to see someone riding a bottle of 'Horseradish Sauce' was satisfying. The Frankfurters were played as Nazis who hated 'Juice' and their symbol was 'ff', made to look the Nazi alternative. Offensive, yes, but a little clever. I like offensive humour.<br/><br/>There were so many opportunities for actual humour it hurts. Nothing that could have been funny was displayed for more than a second.<br/><br/>There was a graphic rape scene.<br/><br/>I get that it sounds ridiculous when you hear that it's a douche forcefully sucking the juice out of a carton.<br/><br/>You might think I am being silly, but I swear to you, if it had been humans, it would have been pretty horrific.<br/><br/>Because it was a cartoon, you were expected to laugh at rape.<br/><br/>Ha ha. No. I don't think any of the viewers found that funny, even the 'laddish' blokes at the back didn't crack a humoured grin.<br/><br/>There's also this really awkward sex scene at the end where all the food engage. This is to really bring home the hot-dog/penis metaphor.<br/><br/>A taco has lesbian sex with a bread roll.<br/><br/>My fingers hurt from typing.<br/><br/>If you're 12 years old and completely new to sex, drugs and swearwords, you and your dude-bros will love this.<br/><br/>If you require a little more maturity and intelligence in your humour, AVOID. Otherwise you'll leave needing to take a shower and needing to withdraw from cinema.",
    "I always thought Captain America was a corny \"golden age of comics\" superhero that had long passed his expiration date. I was shocked by how much I liked him in his first film. I was delighted to grow to like him even more in this one. They set up the character beautifully in the first movie, but he explodes as a hero here. It's hard to fault the character or this movie. Not just the MC, but the whole cast was well written and acted here. The action is well directed and tense. Battles feel much more real than most Marvel battles. There was much less obvious CGI than most films in the franchise, and it pays off. This is one of the best Marvel films to date. Lightning in a bottle. A highlight in the MCU.",
    "Over the years Akshay Kumar's choice of selecting the films has certainly improved with significant examples being Holiday, Baby, Special Chabbis, Gabbar Is Back to name few. Move over commercial masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single blow and typical song-dance routine – Raja Menon's Airlift will give you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitement.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Airlift speaks about the Ranjit Katyal (played by Akshay Kumar) who helps the Indian Government collaborate with Air India to help evacuate 1,70,000 Indians from Kuwait after Iraq raided the country.<br/><br/>From the director of critical acclaimed films like Bas Yun Hi and Barah Aana, Raja Menon does a fantastic research about the feat that was even recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record and surprisingly people are unaware about it. Airlift will consume you right from the beginning especially when Akshay's family faces the issue of Iraqi raiding Kuwait. From here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. The music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. The soulful number such as 'Soch Na Sake' is already a superhit among the viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.<br/><br/>It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. After giving back-to-back hits in 2015 with Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Singh Is Bliing, Akshay Kumar is definitely on a roll. With Holiday, Baby and now Airlift, Akshay Kumar has managed to create a image of \"Mera Bharat Mahaan\" actor and fans will love him in new avatar. The fresh pairing of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur works well. Nimrat Kaur's realistic subtlety would harness Akshay Kumar's machismo and give us that perfect thriller<br/><br/>Overall , Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4.5/5",
    "«We didn't need dialogs, we had faces» said the narcissistic Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in Billy Wilder' \"Sunset Boulevard\", referring to the Silent Era, when she used to be big  before the 'pictures got small'.<br/><br/>The reason of this introduction is that after watching Michel Hazanavicius' critically acclaimed: \"The Artist\", I strongly felt this was the perfect illustration to Norma Desmond's iconic eulogy. From beginning to end, my eyes never ceased to be amazed by the communicative smile of Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, the aging silent movie star and the sparkling eyes of Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, the young and flamboyant starlet. Their faces occupy the screen with such an electrifying magnetism that they don't just steal the scenes, they steal the dialogs  literally.<br/><br/>I was awestruck by Dujardin's performance. To those who didn't grew up with French TV programs, he's one of the most popular and talented comedians of his generation. Dujardin created the character of Brice de Nice, a blonde surfer whose specialty was to 'diss people', but it was so funny it never sounded mean-spirited. He was a member of a cult comic-troop (who made sketches à la SNL) but even back then, he had a little something that made him special: a voice, a smile, a charisma in both TV and movies, in both dramatic and comedic register. There was no doubt in France that the guy who was famous for his impressions of Robert De Niro and the camel (and even De Niro doing the camel) was promised to a brilliant career.<br/><br/>Look closely at Jean Dujardin's face, it's like drawn with 'classic' features: the finely traced mustache who builds a Fairbanks-like charisma like the strength from Samson's hair, the dazzling smile making him look like the lost son of Gene Kelly, and a certain macho toughness reminding of a young Sean Connery. Dujardin's face is a gift from cinematic Gods, and \"The Artist\" finally lets it glide, earning him the Cannes Festival Award for Best Actor. I sincerely believe he deserves an Oscar nomination, because he just doesn't play an actor from the Silent Era, he embodies the Era with the same level of demented craziness as Norma Desmond, in a brighter and more light-hearted side.<br/><br/>Valentin's self-absorption echoes Desmond's cynical ego while his gaudy 'Don Lockwood' mask (Gene Kelly in \"Singin' in the Rain\") hides the more poignant face of his insecurity. He's the star of the screen because only the screen allows him to express his unique talent. While Lockwood had to adapt to the 'talking' revolution, George Valentin makes a conservative U Turn starting an inexorable descent into madness, from an outcast, to a has-been until being finally alienated by his own talkie-phobia. The direction is so clever that it challenges many times our perceptions, creating unexpected feelings of discomfort when real sounds are heard. But I was surprised to see how much it worked on a dramatic level.<br/><br/>And this is the strength of the film, although I expect it to discomfort some viewers: it isn't a tribute in the literary meaning of the word. It has its moments where it tricks us into the use of sounds or dialogs, but never fails to distract us from the core of the story: the romance. Very quickly, we forget about spotting the hints, the references to silent classics: chase scenes, over-the-top comical gesticulations, slapstick jokes etc. This mindset would disappoint those who expected a film with the same material as Mel Brook's \"Silent Movie\", which was clearly a tribute. \"The Artist\" IS a silent movie, featuring a beautiful romance between George and Peppy, who got her break with an idea from George, something that would make her different from the other actresses: a beauty spot above the upper lip. A clever credit-billing montage depicts her consequent ascension to stardom until she finally dethrones George and makes a has-been out of him.<br/><br/>If I mentioned the performance of Dujardin, Berenice Bejo also deserves some accolades because she succeeded in looking so \"old\" from our POV yet so fresh and modern in the film, with the appealing feel-good and optimistic attitude she constantly brings on screen. With her doll-face and youngish smile, she's like a cute little girl enjoying what she does. In a way, Peppy Miller embodies the film's most inspirational element: a positive message about passion and enjoyment. And this indirectly highlights George's source of troubles: being deprived from what he enjoyed the most and suffering from his progressive fading into oblivion. Along with this conflict, the evolution of George and Peppy's romance never feels forced, quite an accomplishment when we consider how slightly over-the-top silent movie stars used to act.<br/><br/>Both Dujardin and Bejo are indeed powerful in an Oscar-worthy level and at that moment, I can't continue without mentioning the third character of the film, George's dog. The relationship between George and the dog provides a sort of Chaplinesque feel to the movie, a mix of tenderness and poignancy, so natural and convincing I wonder if the Academy will think of a honorary Oscar. Anyway, I applaud Hazanivicius for not having reduced \"The Artist\" to a flashy spectacle with no substance, with the word 'homage' as the director's convenient alibi, and make a touching romance about two people who met each other at a pivotal time in the history of film-making, each representing a side of cinema, the old-school silent generation: Chaplin, Keaton, Pickford and the exuberant talkers: Grant, Hepburn, Davis  And I'm glad he found the true note to reconcile between these two universes at the end  didn't I tell you Dujardin was the lost son of Gene Kelly?<br/><br/>\"The Artist\" plays like a missing link between \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" and it's indeed one of the best films of 2011, with the absence of words as an endearing 'beauty spot'.",
    "Opening up with the shooting of Aldos Snow's latest music video and then showing his downward spiral that leads to present day was the hilarious, perfect beginning for this innovative comedic spin-off. If you saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' then this is exactly what you would expect a movie about Aldos Snow to be like. This movie has a heart that I did not expect to see, it's buried under lewd, vulgar and brilliant wit, but it's in there.<br/><br/>Russell Brand just opens his mouth and his words are comedic gold. Jonah Hill takes a step out of his comfort zone, a bit, and plays a \"no confidence good guy\". (Usually he's the overconfident prick, for all you naysayers). Diddy delivers a surprisingly strong performance that I'm sure shocked anyone who sees him. He's actually hilarious! His repartee with everyone he comes into contact with is spot-on. The entire cast has hilarious one-liners and the two main characters really make this movie a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The plot is actually a creative one, something we don't see a lot of nowadays. Albeit the humor treads into \"familiar gross-out\" jokes, there are clever jokes too. But it's all you have to expect when following \"Rock and Roll personified\". Another point I was surprised by was that a lot... a lot of the scenes from the trailers were not in the movie. I thought that was a good and bad thing. Good because it didn't show us stuff we've already seen and gave us the chance to see new stuff. But bad because a few of the scenes were real funny.<br/><br/>For the critics who are hating this movie: Do you like comedy? Do you like Apatow's stuff? Do you like Russell Brand or Jonah Hill? If the answer is no to any 2 of these... why are you reviewing this movie? Your opinion is pointless for the people that actually DO like these movies.",
    "I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action, suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about. This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is one amazing movie.",
    "An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.<br/><br/>Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.<br/><br/>Many details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation, but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However, a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here, hence, though the story moves quickly enough, there is always the feeling that for an action-thriller, there aren't enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren't exciting or grand enough.<br/><br/>But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence didn't do as well here as in the last film, probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog, his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.<br/><br/>Emotionally, this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it's partly because I know what is coming, but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it's because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions - nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.<br/><br/>It is still a movie that can be enjoyed though, and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don't feel for the characters, you won't care about the film.",
    "I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world. <br/><br/>For starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. <br/><br/>The creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. <br/><br/>However there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. <br/><br/>Still these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn't flawless by any means it's certainly entertaining!",
    "We are all familiar with the story and with Steven Hawking. His groundbreaking work 'A brief History of Time' and devastating disabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness and immortal fame.<br/><br/>But few of us could understand the complexities of his personal life and the shocking divorce in 1990 from his long sacrificing wife of more than 25 years. Indeed that episode served to darken his reputation in the minds of many, including myself, who felt ill at ease with anyone who could leave a partner who had done so much for him just at the long awaited moment when international fame and recognition finally arrived.<br/><br/>This wonderful production, so well scripted and paced throughout, serves to explain that vital anomaly in Hawking's life. And it is made all the more poignant as it is based upon the account written by his wife who has borne so much.<br/><br/>But it is the breathtaking performance of Eddie Redmayne as Hawking that simply blasted this film into an extraordinary level. It is difficult enough to mimic so famous a person as Hawking and it is even more difficult to portray so accurately the debilitating and gradually increasing effects of Motor Neuron Disease. But to transmit so clearly the profound emotions and inner suffering that Hawking must have experienced in his agonizing journey was a performance that left me quite speechless and at times in uncontrollable tears.<br/><br/>It would be a travesty of the industry if Eddie Redmayne is not nominated for an Oscar after this performance. And to my mind it was a work of art that simply cannot be equaled let alone beaten.<br/><br/>Have a good handkerchief ready to hand.",
    "Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?  If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.<br/><br/>There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).<br/><br/>In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.<br/><br/>As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",
    "(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was \"dazed and exhausted\" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)<br/><br/>Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'.  So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being \"wowed\" by each frame visually.  How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life?  \"Heck\" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...).  Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!).  But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color.  No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story.  But, I'm glad to say, it's not!  A Bug's Life has real heart.   Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!  Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think!  Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has.  This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing.  The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots.  Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not \"dumbing down\" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.  All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point.  Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?",
    "While book racks are brimming with thought provoking, high concept science fiction, the movie genre tends to be populated by invading aliens, intergalactic wars, and adventure, which makes Director and co-writer Duncan Jones' Moon that much more of an oddity.<br/><br/>Not since Steven Soderbergh's much overlooked 2002 rendition of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris has a movie firmly rooted in the sci-fi realm delivered reflections on the human condition, which Moon does deftly.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only inhabitant of an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from lunar rocks to be shipped back to Earth to fuel the energy starved planet.<br/><br/>Sam's isolated three year posting is about to come to an end and he longs to return to Earth to see his wife. His only company throughout this sojourn has been that of Gerty, the base's HAL-like robot voiced by Kevin Spacey. Unfortunately, the final weeks and days are proving to be the most difficult, and Sam finds himself going a bit squirrelly, leaving both he and the audience to wonder if what's unfolding is actually happening, or merely a drama taking place in his addled mind.<br/><br/>That's about as much plot detail as I'm going to deliver, for to delve any deeper into the story would give too much away. Be prepared, however, for a thought provoking narrative that touches on issues such as scientific ethics, corporate greed, human identity, and compassion.<br/><br/>There are no aliens, lasers/phasers, wormholes, warp engines or jump drives here, just a lonely space age concierge, an unflappable monotone robot, and a whole lot of fodder for your brain to chow down on.<br/><br/>This is what science fiction was meant to be.",
    "\"Absolutely magnificent, Dhoni,finishes off in-style, A magnificent stroke into the crowd! India lift the world cup, After 28 years , The party started in the dressing room. and, Its an Indian captain who's been absolutely magnificent in the night of the final.\" Pretty much one of the best moments of the movie. Massive goosebumps. Ms Dhoni The Untold Story - Is a fantastically made movie which is like two sides of the same coin. The first half which shows why Neeraj Pandey is one of the best directors in the country. While the second half shows why Neeraj Pandey should never make a love story. The movie's main strength is clearly Sushant Singh Rajput who shines in every scene. He has captured the essence of the calm and composed Dhoni and portrayed it brilliantly. The first of the movie is stunning, brilliantly acted, poor special effects with some great dialogues and excellent direction by Neeraj Pandey. The cricketing aspect of Dhoni is so well done. It shows that there is always a team behind a person who is successful. An ode to friendship, struggles, responsibility, compromise and facing life regardless of the unexpected turns and twists. I was in awe how well connected the movie was. Moving from one point to another so effortlessly. Neeraj Pandey's best hour in cinema. The second half starts of well but the two love stories really bring down the movie. The Actresses are likable and all. WTF Neeraj Pandey but the movie moved at a steady pace nevertheless. It was like living the past. The famous India-Pakistan series where Dhoni shines. A lot of moments. It was like a Pleasant flashback. The performances in the movie are brilliant. Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni. What a performance! Not his best, I feel Kai Po Che was better. He was seamless, cool, composed, confident. Just like MSD. He breaks down in one scene. Which was brilliant. The Supporting Star Cast is brilliant.Every Actor in the supporting role. FANTASTIC!!! They are a lot of them. Everyone was brilliant. The actresses were strictly average. The music was decent. The movie is a solid 8-8.5/10. The love angles and the bad special effects in the first half are the only things which could have been improved. You'll love it if you loved cricket. You'll like it if you love good cinema.",
    "This movie is everything I love about movies. It's got great acting, great characters, great story, great dialogue. It's nothing short of amazing. <br/><br/>I haven't seen Farrell in a roll like this before, but he certainly shines. Going from being a brat, to coked up as all hell, to depressed in a matter of minutes and it's hilarious as well as heart breaking.<br/><br/>Gleeson is fantastic in his role too! He plays a perfect mix of cold and calculating, still being sophisticated and also has a conscience of sorts.<br/><br/>Every scene in this movie develops either character or story, and the story unfolds so flawlessly with every passing scene. Going from thinking Ray is just being an arrogant brat to realizing what he has done and why he's acting like he is is a truly fascinating journey, and you can't quite tell whether to laugh or be upset by it, sometimes doing a bit of both at once.<br/><br/>The dialogues and delivery are truly perfect, and it leaves us with so many quotable lines about topics from saving someone you were going to kill from suicide and having a discussion with him about it afterwards to race wars with midgets. Sorry, \"Dwarves\". <br/><br/>The wife telling Harry to bring \"the fellas\" as he leaves and him apologizing for calling her an inanimate object because he was upset brings so much depth to characters and their relationship only from a minute-long scene. True magic with regards to acting and dialogue. This is why dialogue and acting is so important. It brings us closer to the person behind the character and gives the story immensely more depth and excitement.<br/><br/>A cinematic masterpiece!",
    "I teach a college course on WWII, in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. This film comes out on top, perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the Belorussian \"Come and See\" & \"Schindler's List\" are darn close as well).<br/><br/>I had the remarkable experience of watching this film last night with two veterans, one a GI who fought from Omaha to Czechoslovakia. . .and a German infantry officer, a veteran of four years on the Eastern Front. The German, who met Hitler several times, within minutes was exclaiming over the historical accuracy, right down to \"Hitler's\" lower class Munich accent. . .something an American audience would never pick up on. My German friend, who at the end of the war was in East Prussia, in the debacle of attempting to evacuate over a million civilians ahead of the Russians, was profoundly shaken by the film. . .saying the horror, the hospital scenes, the utter chaos, the lynchings, the sight of 12 year old children fighting. . .all of it was real. And an interesting observation by him. . .he had no idea Berlin, at the end, had been as bad as what he witnessed along the Baltic coast and is still haunted by. It truly was \"Gotterdammerung\" for an entire nation and this film brings it frightfully close to you. If you are a parent of small children, the terrifying ending for the Goebbel's children is an absolutely searing nightmare.<br/><br/>I think the most important point of the film was the portrayal of Hitler. . .not as the stereotyped raving madman, usually overplayed like a bad performance of King Richard, but far more subtle. I've talked with many who knew Hitler, including a childhood playmate of Helga, Goebbel's oldest child, and all will tell you that Hitler could be absolutely charming, focused on you, even courtly when with women. The terror is, that even as the actor shows us that \"human\" side, in his soft voice he is dictating orders, observations, and comments of absolute evil. The true form of evil rarely looks evil on the surface, it seduces us with a fair face as it leads, sometimes an entire nation, into damnation. THis film captured that evil.<br/><br/>My German friend's comment at the end of the movie. . .\"I still can not believe we fought for that monster for six years.\" <br/><br/>A history professor at Montreat College",
    "You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",
    "Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of \"otherness\" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. <br/><br/>Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience. <br/><br/>Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",
    "I thought \"The Island\" was fantastic and just was a movie worth watching. Ewan and Scarlett were just great together in this on the seat thriller, the story was just very exciting. Especially since cloning is such a huge debate right now, I know that it is going to get more intense in the future. That's the story's main plot, cloning and wither it's right or wrong of playing God.<br/><br/>The story itself just keeps you guessing and thinking with some very great effects. I would without a doubt recommend \"The Island\" for your viewing pleasure. It's a lot of fun, it's got excitement, romance, action, and a plot that actually worked coming from Michael Bay. :D My only complaint is the ending, which I choose not to give away, but it leaves some room for questioning. Other than that, enjoy! <br/><br/>9/10",
    "This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.<br/><br/>It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. <br/><br/>Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.<br/><br/>We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. <br/><br/>But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.<br/><br/>It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10.",
    "A retired CIA operative, hunted by his own people, reunites his old team for one last mission. It's certainly not an original story, mashing together ideas that we've seen before in the Bourne series, The Expendibles and The Losers. 'RED' (which stands for 'Retired, Extremely Dangerous') is the 4th film this year to be adapted from a graphic novel. It is also the 4th to feature men going on a mission, and the 5th with a plot involving the CIA. I couldn't help but feel skeptical. But then I noticed the cast list and realised that this is meant to be a comedy. At this point I saw the project in a different light. 'RED' is a film in which John McClane, God, Cyrus the Virus and The Queen join forces and kill people for laughs. Clearly this was going to be a film where story and sense came second to cast and chemistry. <br/><br/>From 'Die Hard' to 'Sin City', Bruce Willis' good-guy-having-a-bad-day routine has evolved little, but it does not need to be fixed. His performance in 'RED' is familiar, but he is never less than entertaining. This time he brings with him an air of self-parody. Throughout the film he maintains a carefree poker-face, as though he's done this so many times over the years that he can afford to be relaxed. There are valid attempts at making Willis seem more normal, and these can be quite amusing. The first 10 minutes, which show him adjusting to retirement and aimlessly wandering around the house in his dressing gown, are reminiscent of Carl Fredricksen's first appearance as an old man in 'Up'. Deeper characterisation, however, only serves to show how abnormal he really is, and it is a delight to see him in action.<br/><br/>With the exception of Willis, the cast is made up of actors who have no business waving guns around. Helen Mirren was an inspired choice, as if making up for the predictability of Willis' casting. Flower-arranging OAP on the outside and bad-ass hit-woman on the inside, Mirren is strangely suited to action. There is something about the juxtaposition of her gran-like demeanour with exaggerated violence that makes her very funny and extremely watchable. <br/><br/>John Malkovich is particularly entertaining in his performance as a mentally questionable conspiracy theorist who refuses to retire peacefully. After the numerous roles he has played with an undercurrent of insanity, it is hilarious to see him go full-on howling mad. It is not often that Malkovich gets to flex his comedy muscles, but he steals every scene in which he appears.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is unfortunately the weakest part of this alternative A-Team, not because of his performance but because he is under-utilised. He has little action time and even less characterisation. There is a glimpse at pervy-old-man behaviour (which could have been funny) and a mention of health problems (which could have been touching) but these are quickly forgotten. It is as though the writers were distracted, trying too hard to develop a secondary storyline involving Willis' romance with a pension office clerk. This subplot adds little and distracts from the main picture. It is a pity, because the wasted effort could have been more effectively put into making the story tighter, or on giving Morgan Freeman more screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good laugh, even if you won't remember it afterwards. Taking things less seriously and trying less hard to be cool means that 'RED' is more fun than 'The Expendibles', and less embarrassing too. Stallone can mumble all he wants about \"shooting real action\" - I'd rather see the Queen fire machine guns.",
    "A great story of friendship and survival where an animal escapes from the zoo and his friends go to pick it up but everything goes wrong. The plot and their misadventures are quite original and the whole thing is rendered very well and generates great fun",
    "I just watched this movie last night for the first time. I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.<br/><br/>The movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.<br/><br/>I feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.<br/><br/>If I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it. It's too late now - I can't get it out of my head. I don't think I've ever been affected this much by a movie.",
    "What's interesting to me is the deeper meaning and symbols of the film. The film is really about two women. Sarah, and her friend, Juno. The film opens with Sarah losing both her husband and child in a horrific wreck. Over the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that the accident was caused because the husband was distracted and upset over an affair he was having with Juno. Sarah is aware, at least subconsciously, of Juno's betrayal and that it lead to the deaths of her husband and child. She is not in a place mentally or emotionally to acknowledge it on a conscious level. When Sarah awakens from the wreck, there is a sequence where she runs from darkness. The darkness symbolizes a call to action. Sarah rejects it by running from it. She isn't ready yet. This is classically what chase dreams are about. The dreamer is being pursued by their subconscious given horrible form. If the dreamer can make a conscious effort to stop running and speak to the scary thing chasing them, that dreamer's unconscious will speak directly to the dreamer. This would be the conscious (dreamer) dropping the ego defense (running) and interacting with the subconscious (chaser) to gain new insight.<br/><br/>A year passes and Juno get all the friends together to go spelunking. She lies and takes them to a cave she has discovered because she wants Sarah and her to be the ones who find the cave complex and name it. In Juno's sick mind, she's trying to perform some type of penance. She doesn't see that she's manipulating her friends to do something incredibly dangerous. Juno is a manipulator who only sees things from her own narcissistic point of view. Other people are only as real as Juno feels about them.<br/><br/>Going underground is dream imagery for going into the subconscious. This could be going into a basement under a bar as in Fight Club or even underwater.<br/><br/>Sarah is returning to the darkness that she ran from earlier. She starts to experience hallucinations (waking dreams) mainly her daughter's laugh. Her subconscious is pulling her back to the event that damaged her psyche (the wreck).<br/><br/>They get trapped and so must go deeper into the cave to find a way out. Thus Sarah is going deeper and deeper into her subconscious. It's not readily apparent but it's when they get to the deepest point of the caves (the deepest level of consciousness) that they actually encounter the cave people. If you watch you'll notice that they stop traveling downward (they may fall or are be pushed downward but the never choose to go down). Thus the cave people are the most base and ancient level of Sarah's mind. They lack all their senses. They have no problem-solving or tool-using skills but they are very strong and aggressive. They are a primal force.<br/><br/>While down with these creatures, several key events happen. The first is that Juno and Sarah's friends began to be picked off. The second is Juno's true character is revealed. She stabs one of her friends (accident) but then leaves rather then helps her (because of shock but on purpose). What's interesting is that as soon as Juno reunites with the main group, she makes a big show about she won't leave without Sarah who is missing. She acts differently when people are around. Character is what you do when others aren't watching. Juno is a person of weak character.<br/><br/>The biggest key event is that Sarah is separated from the group and ends up in the den of the cave dwellers. The heart of this lowest level of her subconscious. It is here that Juno's original betrayal becomes fully known to Sarah's conscious self. The friend that Juno stabbed is bleeding to death and tells Sarah of Juno and her husband. It's at this lowest level that Sarah understands Juno. Juno is the type of woman that would wreck the marriage of a good friend, stab a friend and leave them to die alone, and lead all her friends to certain death because of an ego trip. In short, Juno is a destructive force. Sarah kills her hurt friend to end her suffering. This is the action that Juno refused. Sarah empathized with her friend and refused to leave her in pain to make her escape. Juno did not do this. Juno felt that her feelings and safety were more important than her friend's suffering.<br/><br/>The other event that happens in this room, is that Sarah kills a cave dweller child and observes it's mother grieving over the loss. Sarah has now committed the same sin as Juno. The mother tries to kill Sarah. This is what is missing from Sarah's life. Sarah needs to take vengeance on Juno to become whole.<br/><br/>Sarah eventually meets up with Juno again and they began to make their way out as the last two survivors. After the last big fight against the cave dwellers, Sarah confronts Juno about her lies, manipulations, and betrayals. Then, Sarah stabs Juno in the leg and leaves her for the cave dwellers. This the same action Juno took earlier when she stabbed her friend and left her. What is different is that Sarah makes a conscious choice to kill Juno and takes responsibility for the action where Juno avoids the responsibility of everything she has done.<br/><br/>Then there is a long sequence where Sarah is climbing upward out of the dark to the light. This is symbolic of a return to consciousness and the real world.<br/><br/>This movie has parallels with Hamlet. What is missing from Sarah is what was missing from Hamlet. They both need to take action but because of the horribleness of the action they must take, they have recoiled from it and spend the whole story getting to a point where they come to terms with what they must do to be whole.",
    "Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.<br/><br/>Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).<br/><br/>The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.<br/><br/>The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.<br/><br/>What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!",
    "It takes a while for your eyes to get used to the uncanny animation, but once you overcome the ordeal, Beowulf turns into an outrageously entertaining ride. The performances are solid, the visuals are unique, the score is uplifting, and it has great action sequences. It's really good fun for adults of all ages.",
    "You've often heard the sales pitch, \"adults will love it, too!\" almost always referring to a kids' movie and in particularly, an animated movie for children. Well, in this case I agree. Even as a middle-aged adult, I enjoyed this.<br/><br/>The dialog is adult-friendly but at the same time not coarse or crude with no sexual innuendos, no profanity or even a hint of it. Yet, it's hip with some very clever lines.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and offers a few unique twists. David Spade does a fabulous job narrating, has a very pleasing voice, one that's fun to hear. I actually do think adults would like this more than children.",
    "I was very skeptical about this movie from the very beginning, because I thought that this would probably be a dumb monster movie with a similar theme like \"Beauty and the Beast\". However, I was very surprised when I saw the movie and think that it was brilliant!<br/><br/>After reading the reviews on this site, it is my understanding that many people that saw this move completely misunderstood it, both the people that loved it and the ones who hated it. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie is not something similar to Beauty and the Beast for those who might think that! <br/><br/>There are several themes in this movie, but the overall theme is about minorities and how privileged people view those who are different. However to make this message more clear the movie is set in the 1960's, where minorities were generally marginalized. <br/><br/>The lead character Elisa Esposito is a mute woman, who was an orphaned child that was found in a river with wounds on her neck and communicates through sign language. She works in a government laboratory as a cleaning lady. Her friends are her co-worker Zelda, a black woman who serves as an interpreter for Elisa, and her next-door neighbor Giles, a closeted gay man. Elisa discovers a mysterious creature in the facility and begins to bond with it. The creature is a mute humanoid amphibian that was captured in a river in South America by Strickland, who is in charge of the project to study it.<br/><br/>Elisa is the main protagonist in this story, and together with Zelda and Giles, they represent a social minority. Women, handicapped people, black people and gay people are all amongst those that were outcast by society at the time. On the other hand, there is Strickland who is the main antagonist in the story and he represents the privileged people at the time. He is a white man in a privileged position, married with children, religious, and is hostile to those who are not like him. He treats the creature hostilely, beats and abuses it, and calls it a monster.<br/><br/>When Elisa learns that Strickland plans to vivisect the creature, she hatches a plan with the help of her friends to free the creature and keeping it in a bathtub at her apartment and planning to set it free in the ocean. Elisa and the creature bond romantically and it is revealed that the creature has healing powers.<br/><br/>When the day arrives to set the creature free, Strickland arrives and shoots Elisa and the creature. The creature heals itself and kills Strickland. The creature takes Elisa and jumps into the ocean where it heals her. When the creature applies his healing touch to the scars on her neck, she starts to breathe through gills.<br/><br/>Here is the TWIST: This scene reveals that Elisa was of the same kind as the creature all along. She just had a more human like form than the creature. There are different clues throughout the film. She was found as child next to a river like the creature. She was found with the \"scars\" on her neck and they turned out to be dormant gills as the creature healed her. She was mute like the creature. She loved being in water as shown in her morning habits. She was initially attracted to the creature whereas most people would fear it. She comes from a Spanish speaking country, as her last name is Spanish whereas the creature was found in a river in South America.<br/><br/>The creature itself and Elisa represent a minority, as they are alike. The fact that the creature is different yet human like, symbolizes how privileged people viewed minorities at the time. The point of the monster is simply to symbolize how we sometimes view other people that are different from us.<br/><br/>The message of the story is this: You view other people that are different from yourself as \"monsters\" if you don't try to understand them. However, if you try to understand people who are different from yourself, then you will see that we are basically all alike even though we look different.<br/><br/>I think this movie was brilliant and very clever. Guillermo Del Toro did a great job. It is definitely a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>This is my point of view and I hope that you found this helpful.",
    "I saw a sold-out opening night screening of \"Across the Universe\" last night with a group of my friends who had really been looking forward to it. Many of them were extremely disappointed, while in the critical world, Roger Ebert and the New York Times loved it. Because the film was so highly anticipated, and a number of people have asked me how I liked it, I'm writing this review in an attempt to express why the movie is so divisive. I'm not going to talk about plot, or describe any of the numbers. If you're interested in seeing the movie, they'll be more enjoyable if they're unexpected.<br/><br/>It's a bizarre and beautiful movie musical, almost a music video at times, that uses thirty- three of The Beatles' songs and director Julie Taymor's unique visual style to illustrate both a personal love story and the overall conflict in the sixties. The movie is incredibly original and ambitious, and therefore its failings are as dramatic as its successes. Both stem from the same source: Julie Taymor's self-indulgence. That's nothing new to her movies, \"Frida\" and \"Titus\" have the same problem, but in a movie stripped of traditional narrative, it's glaringly obvious. Some songs are impeccably chosen and staged with great creativity, but others are too obvious, or thematically forced so Taymor can cram in another song and stunning visual sequence.<br/><br/>For the first half of the movie, I was frequently divided. One innovative sequence would really pull me into the style, then a forced number or awkward staging would distance me again. When an obvious, recognizable number began, I was torn between a cynical impulse to roll my eyes and an almost exhilarated impulse to laugh and applaud.<br/><br/>\"Across the Universe\" is a mess. There's no denying that. It is poorly paced and badly structured, and at times its feather-light plot and contrived or obligatory numbers become tedious. But at one point, about halfway through, I decided just to go along for the ride. I delighted in every brash, bold choice, whether it worked or not. I let the poignant moments move me, whether or not I intellectually felt that they were contrived.<br/><br/>The Beatles' music had a huge effect on me; from the fateful day that my friend accidentally copied the first three tracks of \"Revolver\" onto my computer, a love affair was born. Their songs are inexorably tied to memories beautiful and horrible scattered all over my life, and as I grow older, I'm constantly discovering new, deeper resonances in their familiar refrains. Even when the context was vague or stretched, the film's reinterpreting and revealing new facets of these songs seemed to serve as a tribute to their breadth and greatness. Taymor's damning depiction of the horrors of war, and lyrical portrait of young, idealistic love are both painfully expressive and unique, and simply took my breath away. By the film's shamelessly corny close, I realized that I had just had a genuine cinematic experience. For all the movies that I watch, that's incredibly rare.<br/><br/>In his review in the New York Times, Stephen Holden writes, \"I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you've tumbled.\" I could laughingly list this movie's flaws from now till next week, but I sort of fell in love with its sheer audacity. You might not. It's extremely naïve, and thematically simple, and you could find that endearing or irritating. You may love it, or you may hate it, but you're going to feel something. This movie will not change your life; don't expect it to. But if you let your criticism fade to the background, and abandon yourself to Taymor's passionate fervor, you may have a pretty amazing experience.",
    "A Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) in the original. Now, that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: Protect John Connor. John Connor(Edward Furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill him;The T-1000(Robert Patrick). Sarah, John, and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day, with a trailing, shape-shifting Termiantor trailing from behind.<br/><br/>This is the greatest of the Terminator trilogy. I have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that Cameron could have improved on. The move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. Schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. He isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. He is a machine. I hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.<br/><br/>The special effects are incredible beyond belief. The shape-shifting T-1000 is some of the greatest animation I have witnessed in cinema history. It absolutely blew my mind when I first experienced this visual extravaganza. The animation looked so real(remembering this was a good ten years). The movie included fast-paced action along with some clever sci-fi drama/horror. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. But the T-1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.<br/><br/>Sci-fi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. This is one of the few exceptions. The prediction of judgment day with Hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of Armageddon. The theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by The Terminator\" It's in your nature to destroy yourselves\". This brings the movie to a whole new level of sci-fi.<br/><br/>Overall, Termiantor II: Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it, buy it! Because once you have seen it, you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "I heard that this movie received negative reviews and feedback, so I was pleasantly surprised when I enJOYed the movie as much as I did.<br/><br/>There is no denying that the grand appeal to the movie was Jennifer Lawrence's compelling performance. The movie's story itself does not seem like it has much to offer. A poor, overworked woman selling a plastic mop does not sound that thrilling on paper. However, Lawrence takes it up a level to a powerful story about a woman never giving up and making her own opportunities happen against all odds. She takes you on an emotional journey from start to finish. Lawrence has the undeniable ability to make you ache along with her struggles. This can be uncomfortable for the helpless movie-goer, which leads me to wonder if this is the reason so many people had distaste for the film. No one wants to be told that hard work and strong will are not enough to succeed in this world, and, as a whole, \"Joy\" does just that. <br/><br/>That being said, \"Joy\" still left me feeling inspired. As a young, aspiration-filled woman myself, Lawrence's portrayal of Joy makes me feel like I can take on the world (which is dream that current American society consistently crushes on the daily). Lawrence's deadpan stares as she struts in and out of offices along with her turning point bathroom haircut, confirm that both Jennifer and Joy are a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>\"Joy\" also possesses a subtle humor, although many reviews seem to deny its existence. The purposefully over the top soap opera scenes obsessed over by bed-bound Terry (played by Virginia Madsen) are just enough to raise the otherwise dark tone. <br/><br/>Lawrence and David O. Russell take you on an emotional journey with \"Joy.\" It may not be the uplifting movie you want this holiday season, but I would argue it is the movie you need.",
    "It's true that you can have too much of a good thing...please no more different editions!<br/><br/>THEATRICAL CUT - was the best version of any of the \"cuts\" it was the most cleanly edited and it had the best soundtrack out of the three. It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.<br/><br/>SUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.<br/><br/>ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don't even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the \"safe room scene\". A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money.",
    "I am 31 so I was 3 when this movie came out. The first time I saw Saturday Night Fever was the \"Edited For Television\" version probably when I was 6 or 7 years old. At that point, it was about the music, the dance scenes and the clothes.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be until years later that I understood what a great story this is. It's a coming of age movie. It's a modern day tragedy. It's a love story.<br/><br/>The first thing that people think about when they hear Saturday Night Fever is disco and bell bottoms, but the story is timeless. Travolta plays Tony Manero, a loser in a nowhere job who only feels alive when he is on the dance floor at the local disco. There he is adored by his friends, by women and by strangers. There he is king. Everywhere else he is nobody. Even at home.<br/><br/>Tony becomes infatuated with a woman named Stephanie. On the surface Stephanie appears to be much better off than Tony. For the most part Stephanie is a big talker, but Tony is bothered by her observations.<br/><br/>\"Let me guess. You work all week long at some dead end job and then you go and blow it at all at 2001 (the disco) on the weekends. You're a cliché. You're no one, going nowhere.\" As much as Tony is upset by her words he can't argue with them. Soon Tony becomes frustrated with his \"station in life\" and tells Stephanie he wants out (of Brooklyn).<br/><br/>What makes Saturday Night Fever work so much for me is Tony is very typical of a lot of males who would rather have a good time and party now than build something toward the future. Bars are full of guys like Tony. Guys who are super stars in their local drinking establishments, but have no life outside of the night life.<br/><br/>And of course there's the superb dance scenes that most people remember Saturday Night Fever for. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, Saturday Night Fever also has my favorite closing shot of all time. It's really nothing special, but I get choked up every time I see it.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is also a snapshot of a period in recent American history. The movie took place in 1977. The country was a mess after the Vitenam war ended and before Reagan stormed Washington and once again instilled a sense of pride in Americans. There was no longer a war to protest, but the average American didn't have much faith in our country. I think Saturday Night Fever does an excellent job of capturing what was probably a common attitude among young adults during the late 70's. Live for the moment because the future is pretty bleak.",
    "For those who don't like documentaries (the documentary about Snowden, which is part of this movie, is excellent education about what our government can do with us) watch this first. Oliver Stone paints a portrait of a stand-up, pretty much button down guy who realizes the work he falls into is anything but what he was taught was right -- and then he needs to find a way out, without endangering his girlfriend. Another great film about a whistleblower --- and for his whistleblowing, he faces far harsher penalties just for coming home. Oliver Stone delivers thought provoking film again, and the entire cast, as well as the writing, is stellar.<br/><br/>For those who made up their mind about Ed Snowden through what was reported in mass media, I would simply say, watch this with an open mind. What happened to him could happen to any of us. This is a cautionary tale based on true facts told in the most exquisite way by Stone and his cast.<br/><br/>Isabeau Vollhardt, author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey",
    "I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.<br/><br/>At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.<br/><br/>There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",
    "***SPOILER ALERT - I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS MOVIE! ***<br/><br/>It's a shame that this film was promoted as a \"hot\" erotic thriller. Kubrick would not have allowed that marketing campaign to go forward had he been alive.  Sure there's a lot of eroticism in this movie, but those who go to it looking for sexual thrills are going to be (and were) sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>The events in this movie are triggered by the protagonist's wife's revelation that she almost slept with another man.  This kicks off a range of emotions and prompts him to re-evaluate his sexual relationship with her, subsequently leading to a trip through his sexual SUBconscious.  This is the critical point that all too many viewers miss, though it's so overtly surreal I don't see how one could miss it.  None of this is real!  It's called Eyes Wide SHUT for a reason!<br/><br/>All of our protagonists' \"encounters\" represent manifestations of his sexual fantasies and fears.  His fantasies include group sex, sex with a teenager, sex with a prostitute, sex without strings.  His fears include disease, homosexuality (notice the brutal and brief encounter with the gay-bashing gang), and most of all: discovery.  Discovery of his hidden fantasies, which might reveal his true nature to the world.  Discovery that he is really a pretender, doesn't really belong, and is not worthy after all.  This latter is probably universal, and in his case while it has sexual dimensions it is not purely sexual.  In the end he realizes that his fantasies are just fantasies, at least some of his fears are legitimate, and that instead of just fantasizing about sex he should actually have sex with his wife.  Not rocket science here, but plenty of people need reminding of this from time to time, and it's a well-told story.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to first see this movie in theaters overseas, and was spared the atrocity of digital editing to make things less explicit. David Lynch did the same thing more recently in Mulholland Drive, and I hope that this is not the beginning of a trend.  Given all of the explicit gore and brutality in movies, the level of sexual explicitness that triggers the censors is simply laughable.  Frankly, having seen the un-edited version, I didn't think it was a big deal.<br/><br/>One can't dismiss criticisms that the nudity was all female and many of the women were depicted as sexual objects, but this movie is quite pointedly a trip through a fairly conventional man's sexual unconscious and necessarily told from a male point of view.  So none of these things should be a surprise.  It would be very interesting to see a comparable exploration of the female sexual subconscious by an accomplished woman director, though I'm not holding my breath that the Hollywood establishment will allow that to happen soon.",
    "I had no idea what was going on most of the time because I'm not particularly familiar with Warcraft's story. That being said, this is a decent movie, especially considering it's a video game franchise film...90% of the time video game films are very badly adapted to the screen.",
    "Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)<br/><br/>It was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn't end there however...<br/><br/>This film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali's face, and Zahra's tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.<br/><br/>We see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali's Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.<br/><br/>There is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.<br/><br/>Later in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.<br/><br/>The film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour.  This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.<br/><br/>The film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.<br/><br/>Missing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.<br/><br/>I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Ollie",
    "Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.<br/><br/>What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (on scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation who is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The set up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it is involving, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action so much more effective, as we are so invested in the characters, for all their all too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge for its entirety, and doesn't cop out at the end either.<br/><br/>The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles, when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on-screen power these days). This film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and the quality of the film. It just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt, it ends up going straight to video. I wish I'd got the chance to see this on the big screen.",
    "I must say, no signs of aging. Embedded in its day and yet totally relevant. Perhaps the most entertaining of all of Hitchcock's films. Marriage is the theme and murder is the hook. James Stewart is as perfect as he's ever been. He uses the contradictions of his character to create someone immediately familiar. Thelma Ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. Grace Kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream. She remains a sort of dream that's why to see her climb the killer's balcony is one of my most cherished film memories. If you haven't seen the film you may think I'm rambling but if you have, you know exactly what I mean, don't you?",
    "Pier Paolo Pasolini, as is well known, was murdered not long after he finished work on this, his most audacious and confrontational film, yet even the most casual viewing of SALO begs the question - had he not been murdered, would he have taken his own life anyway? Every sequence, every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair, barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race, one gets the impression that Pasolini was barely hanging onto life - and any attendant shreds of hope - by his fingernails. Although ostensibly an adaptation of one of DeSade's most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the Second World War with the Fascist ruling classes as its (authentically vile) villains, SALO also contains a lot of contemporary criticism - Pasolini hated the modern world, and explained the stomach-churning 'banquet of s**t' as a none-too-subtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains. (The scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society - those who come to SALO expecting titillation or B-movie sleaze will be sorely disappointed.) Beyond the nihilistic content, which has been well documented elsewhere, the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washed-out, faded film stock using primarily static cameras, long shots, choppy editing and very few cutaways, SALO has a visual style reminiscent of cinema-verite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music, piano dirges and the (intentionally?) scrappy post-dubbed dialogue, and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. SALO comes across as one long primal scream of rage, designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency, and in this respect, the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once, or indeed for 'entertainment', is another matter, but SALO is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it.",
    "I had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.<br/><br/>I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.",
    "There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic that will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers, just like its predecessors by Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott. Despite the many questions I had in my mind when I left the theater and the moments during the film when I felt disappointed or confused, I knew this, and I have not stopped thinking about the movie and longing to be back in front of the screen.<br/><br/>It is easy to criticize this movie as some have done for being overly ambitious, pandering to low taste, being too simple or too complex, with too few actors or too many, or even for celebrating revenge violence against professional critics who write negative reviews. They may all be correct, but these critics will still put themselves in the same category as those that warned audiences against 2001 or Blade Runner. The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach, its visual and acoustic impact, its mesmerizing flow and its completely ground-breaking storytelling, and movie goers will see it and feel it in their guts. <br/><br/>It is a movie that is a product of our age of internet-driven universal knowledge and vision, and the freedom we have to travel the world and jump between ages, genres, images and identities at our will. It reminds us that we are human and that we can still hear our heart beat, if we listen.",
    "Some reviewers have suggested that the storyline of this movie is a bit plodding and portentous, and I'd be willing to allow that. But even if this film had absolutely no plot to speak of, I would have considered the money I plunked down yesterday to see \"Hero\" to be money well-spent, because I have been witness to some of the most achingly beautiful film-making I've ever seen. As in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but \"Crouching Tiger\" surely could have benefited from the sublime camera eye of \"Hero.\" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality. At a time when movie theaters show a lot of utter dreck, we ought to be supporting movies like this.",
    "Anyone who knows me knows my favorite band is The Beach Boys, and my favorite musician is their leader, Brian Wilson. I first got deep into their music last November when I heard their album SMiLE, an album which wasn't officially released until 45 years after its conception and recording. It was worth the wait, as I consider it the best album I've ever heard.<br/><br/>I found out that a biopic of Wilson was in the works, and would be screening at SXSW with Wilson in attendance. I knew I had to go and see this film. The experience is one that will stick with me for the rest of my life as one of the most emotionally powerful events I have been a part of.<br/><br/>Love and Mercy is the story of The Beach Boys' founder Brian Wilson. The film chronicles his rise to fame in the 1960's and the his decline into mental illness, and his escape from the control of his therapist in the 1980's.<br/><br/>Paul Dano plays Wilson in the 1960's, and John Cusack plays him in the 1980's. It also stars Elizabeth Banks as Wilson's future wife, Melinda Ledbetter, and Paul Giamatti as his therapist, Eugene Landy.<br/><br/>Paul Dano exudes the boyish look of young Wilson perfectly. He relearned how to play piano for the role, and sings much of the music in the film.<br/><br/>His performance is hard to watch at times because of how depressing it is seeing him devolve from an energetic, fun young man into a tortured, drained artist. Dano handles the role with passion and care, and his performance never feels forced or fake.<br/><br/>When Wilson begins to suffer a panic attack, anyone who's had one will feel deeply for him. When he starts to have physical symptoms of depression after years of physical and mental abuse from his father and disapproval of his musical direction from fellow band mate Mike Love, Dano portrays the hurt that comes from those events with subtle facial expressions and natural transition.<br/><br/>John Cusack looks less like Wilson physically, but his performance may be even more complex. His Wilson has been to the bottom, and he brilliantly portrays how challenging it is to rebuild your life after going through mental and physical anguish.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Banks has a great departure from her more well known comedic film roles, and as Ledbetter, she shows her strength and respect for the man she loves through actions and subtle expressions instead of overt, over the top dialog.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti has the most campy role in the film as Eugene Landy, but this is unfortunately how Landy was in real life. He was as violent and controlling over Wilson's life as the movie portrays, so his abusive, manipulative, angering performance is highly accurate.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Love and Mercy is that it doesn't exaggerate or make up events to make the film more interesting. The filmmakers trust the strength of its source material is interesting enough to make for a great story.<br/><br/>The storytelling structure of the movie is interesting and risky. The film jumps from the 60's to the 80's without warning, and it works. The slightly askew technique allows the audience to experience the downfall and uprising of Wilson's life simultaneously, and allows the movie to end on a happy note.<br/><br/>One complaint people have is that the film skips over the 1970's, Wilson's most tumultuous period in which he weighed 300 pounds and spent the majority of three years in bed, crippled by depression and drug addiction. However, this allows the audience to examine the reasons for his downfall and redemption instead of indulging in the horrible escapism Wilson turned to.<br/><br/>Beach Boys fans will appreciate the movie more than the average film-goer. Mike Love in hats, dancing, and mentioning \"the formula\"? Check. Drug tent and piano in the sandbox in Wilson's living room? Check. The infamous \"Fire\" session? Check. Everything is on point, from the scarily accurate wardrobe down to recreating the \"Sloop John B.\" and \"Surf's Up\" promo videos shot for shot. It's these moments that show the film was made by fans with an attention for detail.<br/><br/>Almost every song on the album Pet Sounds is featured in the film somewhere. Seeing Wilson's unorthodox recording techniques is such a pleasure for music nerds.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Robert Yeoman, best known for creating the look of Wes Anderson's films, blends stylistic tone with realistic camera work, creating a sense of false nostalgia that is surreal yet inviting and intense.<br/><br/>Composer Atticus Ross works wonders with the score, using a great wealth of Wilson's music in different ways and choosing songs that fit with the emotional tone of the scene brilliantly. Hearing the instrumental version of \"Don't Talk\" play as Wilson takes LSD for the first time is haunting. Witnessing the song \"Til' I Die\" play over a surreal, Kubrickian scene in which Wilson has an epiphany made me cry because of the powerful combination of imagery and music.<br/><br/>The film is being released on June 5, to capitalize on The Beach Boys music being a staple of the summer, but it feels more like a Thanksgiving release to me. The cinematography, acting, script, and score are all Oscar worthy in my opinion, but the film may get lost in the race to other contenders, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Love and Mercy is an awesome, unorthodox biopic that takes risks with form and narrative that has strong performances, script, cinematography, and of course, an amazing soundtrack. It will expose young people to the brilliance of Wilson's music and give older fans an insight into why Wilson is the poster boy for using creativity as an escape and an outlet from the pain of life and mental illness.<br/><br/>And seriously, listen to the album SMiLE.",
    "If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.",
    "With workers striking in Russia, the crew of the battleship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me  surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.<br/><br/>The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the media but also a cracking good film in its own right.",
    "Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.<br/><br/>Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to \"Christmas Town\". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.<br/><br/>People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! <br/><br/>10/10",
    "The internet is a funny place... it seems to be filled with people who have graduated with 5 Ph.Ds. and clearly seem to be smarter than everybody else (thousands of astronauts and astrophysicists on IMDb apparently). One star rating? Come on... Clearly, you haven't watched enough films to know decent from terrible.<br/><br/>I watched this film without having heard of it (no trailers, spoilers or anything). I'm a sci-fi fan and thought this was a good watch.<br/><br/>I found the characters to lack depth and their actions were questionable at times but the plot was believable and the acting decent. Special effects were good and made the movie believable in my opinion. The movie was well shot and I thought the scenes with the creature were pretty cool.<br/><br/>I don't get how people even compare this movie to \"Aliens\"; it's nothing alike. Overall, I thought it was pretty good.",
    "The cultural references of Wayne's World may date it a bit, but the nature and personality of its humor set it apart. There is a kind of naive benevolence and boundless joy which makes this movie so lovable. Its aimless plot and exaggerated humor are cute, without ever transcending that barrier into maudlin sentiment. This is a difficult mix to achieve, especially when so many comedians go out of their way to achieve \"street credibility\" through as much forced vulgarity and stereotypical humor as possible. Campbell and Carvey's characters were the ultimate comedic anti-heroes for generation X, even more so than Jay and Silent Bob, Bill and Ted, or Beavis and Butthead. They championed amateurism, paraded self-affecting humor, and became worshiped for telling everyone they weren't worthy. If '60s pop culture encouraged people to \"do your own thing,\" Wayne and Garth were the genuine article in the '90s. Two complete geeks had fun acting as themselves, and became celebrated in the process. One of the true comedy classics of our time. 8.5/10",
    "Let me confess I'm not a Catholic, I don't have children, I can't stand schmaltz and yet I love The Sound Of Music. I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: \"It makes you feel alive\" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you.",
    "I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, i was simply compelled to watch it until the end. I already knew how it ended so i was surprised it commanded my attention so intensely.<br/><br/>The fact is the characters were all so realistically portrayed and the film was so expertly directed that it was almost as if the Apollo 13 disaster was filmed and that is what i was watching.<br/><br/>Now this film is certainly not to everyone's taste, it is quite slow in the build up and the film relies almost entirely on the script and ability of the cast.<br/><br/>If you like your disaster films loud and in your face then this is probably not for you, but if you like them realistic (slightly dramatised) then watch it and be astounded.<br/><br/>9/10",
    "A true best of both worlds for classic Disney and classic Pixar fans. It had already been many years since the acquisition, but for me this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar doing Disney.",
    "Much as I admire Spike Lee's talent and audacity, this film just didn't work for me. Too many preposterous plot points while the motivations (of everyone, it seemed) were never clear. The whole thing was just confusing.<br/><br/>And yes, disjointed.",
    "Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger has experienced both. On January 15, 2009, Sully made the decision to land the crippled aircraft of US Airways flight 1549 right into a river  an event immediately labeled \"Miracle on the Hudson\".<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this is the first film collaboration for Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood. Both have cinematic experience with true life stories and real people: Hanks most recently in Captain Phillips and Bridge of Spies; and Clint with American Sniper and J. Edgar. This one is the perfect fit as Hanks takes on a good man who takes pride in doing his job, and Clint brings to life a story that showcases the best of human nature.<br/><br/>Tom Komanicki adapted the screenplay from the book \"Highest Duty\", co-written by Sully and Jeffrey Zaslow. Much of the attention is given to the doubts and uncertainty Sully experienced during the NTSB review. The scrutiny of his work by the committee (played here by the ultra-serious Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan) left his career and reputation dangling, inspiring nightmares that are much worse than yours and mine.<br/><br/>Certainly we are in awe of what Sully pulled off that morning, but as movie goers, we are anxious to see the plane crash/splash/landing. Clint comes through in breath-taking fashion. While it lacks the hysterics and drama of the upside-down plane in Flight, this re-creation is so realistic that we nearly obey the flight attendants repeated instructions of \"Heads down. Stay down\". Even the cockpit chatter, passenger evacuation, and first responder's (many of whom are real life folks, not actors) activities are played in matter-of-fact manner  more people just doing their job. We shiver knowing the icy Hudson River water is 36 degrees, and we feel Sully's anxiety as he desperately tries to get a final count  a count that he prays will hit 155.<br/><br/>Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles and has a couple of memorable scenes, and Laura Linney embraces the thankless role of telephone wife of Sully during the aftermath and hearings. We get a glimpse of Sully's background with flashbacks to his flight lessons at a Denison Texas private airfield, as well as a portion of his military service. Hanks is the perfect choice for a role that would have suited James Stewart just fine if it were the 1940's.<br/><br/>The conflict here comes from the NTSB inquiry. Backed by computer simulators that show the plane could have coasted back to LaGuardia, we get the distinct feeling that the committee's goal is finding human error – naming a scapegoat (other than Canadian geese) for their \"lost\" plane. It's Sully who reminds us that the committee is simply doing their job  just as he was, Skiles was, the Flight Attendants were, and the first responders were.<br/><br/>This is technically expert filmmaking. We know the ending, but are glued to the screen. Frequent Eastwood collaborator Tom Stern handles the cinematography, and like the acting and story-telling, the camera work avoids any excess or over-dramatization. The film provides one of the best examples ever of the duality of hero worship and intense scrutiny, and how a person can be a hero by simply doing their job. The closing credits show clips of the flight's reunion and every survivor would agree that the best among us allowed a continuation of life  something that could have gone to the other extreme.",
    "It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan's \"worst\" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. <br/><br/>Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the aestetics of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the \"comic book\" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me. <br/><br/>As for the score, I am more than willing to argue that this is, hands down, James Newton Howard's best score of his very successful career. It is compelling and booming. It's very powerful, but not over-the-top and excessive. For anyone with the soundtrack, check out 'The Orange Man' and 'Visions'. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. And I stress the word \"powerful\". Yeah, he's no Hermann or Morricone, but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling. <br/><br/>The writing and the direction are just as captivating as the score. Almost every line of dialogue and every scene seems to be placed out on an island, alone so that everyone can stop and judge it. Some people might view this as cocky and/or boring direction, but I see it as daring and unique. Much of Shyamalan's writing is done that way. ('…I see dead people…' '...They call me Mr. Glass…' etc. etc.) Another aspect of the film that tickles my fancy is the underlying themes. I do believe, to a certain extent, that people do have somewhat supernatural powers at times. People have been known to make miracles and do unbelievable things. Maybe these things could be 'developed' in some way. These theories are, in a way, intertwined with some aspects of psychology, such as selective attention and self-actualization. If you care to discuss some of these ideas, let me know and I will relate them to the film through my eyes. In short, I do believe there is a superhero in everyone. It may not be through supernatural powers, but it may simply be through the act of reaching out to a person in need. Other themes of the movie, like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing, yet universal. From a psychological point of view, Shyamalan really gets inside the head of OI patients (osteogenesis imperfecta). He then brings this psyche to the next level with Jackson's character. Elijah, is very passionate but very tortured and evil. His interactions with Willis bring depth and focus to both the characters and the story. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. The shots of Willis in his security poncho. The train station scene. Elijah's breathtaking fall on the stairs and many more speak so loudly to me and say so much in just a simple clip. For some reason this movie just speaks to me, like art. If anyone cares to discuss more about this film, that'd be cool. There is a lotta other cool stuff to talk about with this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it a few more times. It may not be the feel good film of the year, or the masterpiece that everyone was looking for, but it definitely sits well with me.",
    "Well, if I could split the movie into two, I would say that the first half is a superb Proposal and the second half is fairly traditional Hollywood pablum. In the first half, the wonderful comedic timing and chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds was terrific. The writing was first-rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put-downs. Kudos to the Director, Anne Fletcher, and the Screenwriter, Pete Chiarelli.<br/><br/>The completely different tone in the second half, I surmise, could only be attributed to the studios/producers stepping in and stating that the film must appeal to a wider audience. We, then, get lots of family characters thrown in, with a great reduction of Bullock and Reynolds mutual screen time. And when they do share time in the second half, it's more about slapstick/physical humor (cue studios/producers needing appeal to wider, a.k.a, younger audience). Maudlin music comes in on the soundtrack, letting us know that this part of the movie is supposed to tug on our heartstrings.<br/><br/>I don't buy the inevitable resolution either. I don't believe that it is supported well or justified by what came before it.<br/><br/>The 1st 45 minutes is WELL worth seeing. I wish the filmmakers could have pushed and maintained the pace and feel for the entire movie. Reynolds and Bullock are so good, they could be this generation's Tracy and Hepburn. I'd like to see them in another project that follows through all the way.<br/><br/>BTW, this film was actually shot in Boston and (the Alaska scenes) in Manchester by the Sea and Rockport on the North Shore with digital effects adding snow capped mountains. You might even recognize Motif No.1, a famous small building on a wharf in Rockport which has been the subject of many famous painters' and photographers' work. It was also fun seeing some of my local Boston area acting colleagues doing background work in the film.",
    "I was supposed to be be seeing either Flight or Argo today, but to my disappointment I missed both showtimes, and I was in a tight time frame where I could see anything. So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how \"pretty\" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. <br/><br/>Overall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it. Highly recommended.",
    "What unlikely trio to fall in love with, just as unlikely as the landscape. When a movie fits so well without a tag that links it to anything else in its historic film context, it can only be described as a happy accident. Premeditated for sure, but accident nonetheless. Terence Stamp, is an actor with a spectacular career. Varied and surprising. It defies description, but let me try. Peter Ustinov's \"Billy Budd\" William Wyler's \"The Collector\" Federico Fellini's \"Spirit of the Dead\" John Schlesinger's \"Far From The Madding Crowd\" Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"Teorema\" Joseph Losey's \"Modesty Blaise\" Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\" Stephen Frear's \"The Hit\" Richard Donner's \"Superman\" \"Steven Sodebergh's \"The Limey\" Am I making my point? He is an actor for all seasons, beautiful beyond belief to boot. In \"The Adventures of Pricilla Queen of The Desert\" he unveils another unexpected side to his considerable talents. A Woman. And what a woman, a Meryl Streep with a past and, thanks to director Stephan Elliot, with a future. Dressed by geniuses. More human than ever. He is flanked by two spectacular Aussies. Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) giving a performance of such tenderness that even my brother in law, a homophobic macho man of the first order,loved him. And Guy Pearce (L A Confidential) He is such a beautiful,sexy, funny girl that made me long for a her/he all to myself. Some other monstrously cloned movies were rushed into production trying to capitalize on the success of Pricilla. They all failed miserably and rightly so. Frank Capra, accepting his AFI Lifetime Achievement Award sent a profound and heartfelt advise to young filmmakers. \"Don't follow trends, start new ones\" Well done Mr Elliot. Well done.",
    "The movie, \"Se7en\", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.<br/><br/>The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from \"The Divine Comedy\", sets out to, \"preach\" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.<br/><br/>Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.<br/><br/>Score 10/10",
    "Army of Darkness (1992) is in my opinion by far the best one of the \"Evil Dead\" trilogy! It is my second favorite film of the trilogy, I just love, love this movie to death!!!! It is my personal favorite horror movie in the Evil Dead series. The best one is the theatrical cut the rest versions are pure crap with lameness. The original cut kicks ass!!! Great movie! This movie is so silly, that it's actually funny. <br/><br/>I have always loved Army of Darkness and I always will. I love this film to death!!!! I was watching with my dad this film and even he loved it. So yes I proud to say I love this film and I have enjoyed More than the original The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987)! This film has funny moments, balance, smart genius creativity, great babes, mystic forces and mystic knights in it.<br/><br/>Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun. <br/><br/>Army of the dead who were actually skeletons were fabulous, the fights were awesome and they and they were highly enjoyable. The film was fast paced from the beginning till the end. I am sorry if you guys love Evil Dead 2 much better than this film, I just love Army of Darkness much better, this film is just a great worthy sequel to their predecessors. Ash is like ably hero on screen and he is one of the most popular hero's till it's days. Army of Darkness is a classic. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, & the special effects masters KNB! You cant ask for more. Great story, funny lines, fantastic looking monsters. I don't care what anyone says I just love this film to death!!! <br/><br/>What we get in here is a hybrid of sorts with Bruce Campbell once again as Ash the reluctant hero fighting ghouls and goblins (well maybe not goblins) in the medieval times. This third chapter goes for more of the laughs rather then the scares and actually offers up a fun take on the genre mix director Sam Raimi tells. The movie is not as annoying as the previous 2 films and closes out the trilogy nicely. They are a lot of talks of an Army of Darkness 2 and I don't want any sequel to this horror/comedy flick. I thought this film closed the trilogy beautiful. There is a lots of comic relief, over the top cuts, BOOMSTICK!!!!! <br/><br/>Army of Darkness is my second favorite movie (Evil Dead II, Dark Knight, ARMY OF DARKNESS) and here's why. It follows the character of Ashley (Ash) J. Williams in his journey to the past that is far better explained in Evil Dead II. He is only able to be sent back to his own time (and his job at S Mart) if he finds the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) which will also free the people who can help him from the attacks of the deadites. Ash has to find the book, get the babe, fight some demons, and get back home...like in the deal. This movie has it all, and some sugar, baby! It is a hilarious, gory, wonderful display of Bruce Campbell's ingenious acting ability, and anyone who says differently is a deadite. It's a film that would make Clive Barker proud. An oddball yet absolutely successful pairing of slapstick Comedy and undead Horror with a medieval setting thrown into the mix for good measure, 1992's Army of Darkness sits proudly near the top of the list of most unconventional yet absolutely entertaining motion pictures in history. Following up on 1981's oft-banned The Evil Dead and 1987's The Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (itself a Horror-Comedy hybrid), Army of Darkness represents the most accessible and audience-friendly of the three. Special effects; gore; humor; and of course, Bruce Campbell's over-the-top antics are Awesome!!! Hail to the king, baby.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is a 1992 American dark fantasy action comedy film directed by Sam Raimi. It is the third installment of the Evil Dead franchise. The film was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell (also acting as co-producer) and Embeth Davidtz. Continuing from Evil Dead II, Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.<br/><br/>Beyond in human flesh, inked in blood-and amazingly hard to pronounce-the ancient \"Necronomicon\" (Book of the Dead) unleashes unspeakable evil upon mankind in director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic. Back to do battle with the hideous \"Deadites,\" Bruce Campbell reprises his role from the Evil Dead series as Ash, the handsome, shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk from S-Mart's housewares division. Demonic forces time warp him-and his '73 Oldsmobile-into England's Dark Ages, where he romances a beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and faces legions of undead beasts, including a ghastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the dead, rescue his girlfriend and get back to his own time? This movie is personal second favorite movie it is 10/10.",
    "Going into the theater, I was under the impression that this was a silly James Franco and Seth Rogen movie that made fun of The Room, a legendary bad movie. That's not what the Disaster Artist is at all. Instead, it celebrates The Room. It celebrates Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, their passion, and their pursuit of a dream. <br/><br/> Sure, The Disaster Artist comments on how The Room bombed terribly; it had to acknowledge this. It comments on the utter lack of acting talent that Tommy and Greg possessed; it had to acknowledge this too. But it handles these details with such delicacy and care that I never felt that it was putting down the characters. Actually, it seemed that the film admired them. Even when the world told them to quit, they never gave up on themselves or each other. The message is surprisingly inspiring. <br/><br/> The movie becomes something more than mere mockery because of the way it handles the relationship between Tommy and Greg with such care and affection. The two genuinely liked each other and saw each other in ways that no one else did. Greg certainly did not understand all of Tommy's methods and decisions, but he understood Tommy's good intentions. Establishing this buddy connection is crucial later in the movie. <br/><br/>After Tommy writes The Room and they begin filming, Tommy expresses his idiosyncrasies in full force. While the film crew sees him as a confusing weirdo, we know there's something more. Despite his utter incompetence in directing and acting and all aspects of filmmaking, we still root him. And we still root for Greg, ever the supportive friend. Tommy makes absurd and confounding choices that don't make sense to Greg and they don't make sense to anyone else either. Even one of Tommy's explanations was simply \"people do crazy things.\" Still, Greg remains loyal. <br/><br/>With as strange as Wiseau behaves, capturing his eccentricities would clearly prove challenging. Give James Franco credit for capturing Wiseau's weirdness in character without ever devolving into derisive mockery. Franco captures his gait, stiff shoulders, hunched posture, indeterminable and inconsistent accent, and his laugh. Watching The Room and hearing Tommy Wiseau laugh, I thought that it sounded completely fake. I chalked it up to another instance of poor acting. But after seeing Wiseau in interviews, I realized that it was his real laugh. To him, the laugh wasn't poor acting because that's what he thinks a genuine laugh sounds like. <br/><br/> Seeing and hearing Wiseau behaving as himself explains a lot about his behavior in The Room. He's just an interesting and very unusual guy. His acting and the acting of others in his movie is still atrocious, but it shifts from startlingly and confusingly bad to understandably bad. And more importantly, seeing the real Tommy makes his movie all the more fun. <br/><br/> You don't need to see The Room to enjoy The Disaster Artist. Would it help? Sure. Seeing The Room first makes many of the inside jokes made in The Disaster Artist funnier and gives a clearer sense of how confoundingly weird the movie truly is. Words cannot do it justice. To understand, you have to see The Room for yourself. I recommend seeing both.",
    "This film is an insult to Faith Sultan Mehmet, to Ottoman history, and to the intelligence of any audience. It is the very example of how western orientalizm can be internalized. The reason why the conquest of Constantinopolis was a matter of survival for the Turks -the economical, political reasons- were totally non existent. Mehmet II, a well educated man, is nothing more than a religious zealot in this film. Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, who is well respected by the Turks, is a caricature. <br/><br/>Suicide bombings, only a phenomenon of late 20th century, is a common theme in the film: all Ottoman soldiers behave like suicide bombers! What is this? What are they trying to imply? This is a part of the recent series of superficial films and TV shows which seem to aim de-educating Turkey, constantly attack reason, and play at Turkish people's feelings of being under attack of western contempt, orientalizm and memories of WWI defeat.<br/><br/>The side themes fail as hard as the main theme: an absurd love story, a wife with no dialogue, unexplainable motives of Urban, and so on... <br/><br/>This film is harshly criticized in Turkey. I can't imagine why it is being defended so eagerly on IMDb. Because it fails in stirring any feeling of satisfaction of national pride as well. No character study, no context, no wit, not even a propaganda, just the first depiction of the conquest with a relatively big production, a way to imagine how it was, and that's why people go to see this movie in masses. One can't deny the production of war scenes is an improvement for Turkish film industry, but unfortunately, that's all.",
    "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy's dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit & charm along with Indy's usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.<br/><br/>This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg's output: A young Indiana \"beginning\" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat \"You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it.\" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. <br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There's a bit of kissing/banter, and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. There's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy's Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it's up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
    "I attended the Cast and Crew screening on Sunday, in Leicester Square, with high hopes for this film as it's without doubt the most exciting job I've had. This was my first feature experience, and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.<br/><br/>But, even as someone with a lot of time for his films, and a pre-existing bias, I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free-floating, evocative trip. Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.<br/><br/>With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his \"Tideland\" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem, that Tim Burton, while he is still making decent films, has been a long way off special for some time now.<br/><br/>6/10 (if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5), but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids, I'm sure it'll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved, and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film (although I got this one for free...)",
    "I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.<br/><br/>I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created. The Return of the King was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!",
    "What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! <br/><br/>I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.<br/><br/>Back to the Future (1985) <br/><br/>From the Academy Award \"- winning team of Steven Spielberg\" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.<br/><br/>At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car \"DeLorean\". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.<br/><br/>After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.<br/><br/>What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.<br/><br/>They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.<br/><br/>More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost \"chewed every scenes\" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs \"The Power of Love,\" and \"Earth Angel\".<br/><br/>The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as \" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! \"",
    "***May contain Spoilers***<br/><br/>I was embarrassed as an American seeing this film. Just knowing that it would be seen over seas. It's amazing how a submarine can withstand 40 depth charges while another could be put out by two. And I believe it would also be a virtual impossibility for Americans to commandeer a German sub and vice versa.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this movie is its arrogant rewriting of history. It was the British who first captured the enigma machine NOT the Americans. We have no right to take credit for other nations accomplishments. Hollywood simply has a historical ignorance. But beyond that it is still just an awful, awful movie. No one with half a brain would be entertained by this garbage.",
    "This film isn't for all people. That's to say about a lot of movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs?<br/><br/>First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of \"time slowdowns\" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads traveling in slow-motion across the screen... it's all there. <br/><br/>The story on the other hand isn't very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.<br/><br/>Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly cliché phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. \"I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honor then live in shame!\" Sounds familiar? <br/><br/>Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.<br/><br/>Now that's fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.<br/><br/>I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.<br/><br/>So here's the deal.<br/><br/>If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes, wonderful camera-work and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You'll be missing out if you don't. There is so much to see, so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It'll leave you in awe.<br/><br/>However, you are looking for a good story, clever plot twists, some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this, nor does it wants to give you this. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie so much, but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish, and that's understandable. Just be sure to make up your mind about what you want to see when you go to the theater yourself instead of being drawn into bias by the tons of reviews this site has to offer.",
    "The early 90s version of an action movie - non stop gunfire and fights. One very good reason to watch this series is that any movie after this seems to be excellent. The only saving grace are some really old wisecracks from Jason Statham. Skip it, if you need to.",
    "The assassination of JFK has been told in every possible way through every available medium. Oliver Stone managed the unimaginable transforming and almost folk tragedy, through a mix of drama and cinema veritè, into a riveting mystery thriller with the paranoiac style of a man who's in touch with paranoia in a quasi permanent basis. Unnerving, frustrating and spectacularly satisfying. Kevin Costner manages to be convincing as the center piece of the conspiracy theory. We believe the whole damn thing because we see it through his logic. Sissy Spacek, as his wife, represents most us and she does it brilliantly. Tommy Lee Jones and Kevin Bacon are a pleasure to watch. Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and even John Candy, Sally Kirkland and Vincent D'Onofrio deliver little parts of the puzzle without ever becoming distracting. Gary Oldman is a chilling dead ringer for Lee Harvey Oswald. For film lovers, for history nuts, for pop culture fanatics and for conspiracy theorists, this is a must.",
    "Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.<br/><br/>Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!",
    "In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.",
    "I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can't get aboard the hype train. It's really the same as every other cartoonish, overblown comic-book action movie, except with a female protagonist.<br/><br/>Actually, this is worse than the average comic book movie, because it preaches to the audience about pacifism but then hypocritically celebrates \"heroic\" violence. In other words: Wonder Woman is an alleged pacifist who kills a bunch of people. Wonder Woman is also an alleged feminist, who allows Steve Trevor to drive the entire plot and basically steal the movie from her. Really, this thing is about as progressive as Dick Cheney's great-great grandfather.<br/><br/>I could forgive Wonder Woman's flimsy social commentary, if it were any good in other respects. But the plot is loose and shabby, the CGI is poor, and about half the scenes were shot in front of a green screen. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if I was watching a real movie, or Patty Jenkins playing God of War on her Playstation 2. (When exactly did cinema and video games blend into this horrible hybrid art form, which has none of the beauty and charm of old-school cinema?)<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the villains. The World War I era Germans are depicted as cartoonishly eeeevil, while the same era's British Empire is held up as a heroic ideal. Meanwhile, the main villain is a nightmare of bad CGI, who looks like he belongs on a 1980s heavy metal album cover. Naturally, they got a wonderful actor for this stupid part and wasted him entirely.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm going overboard on criticisms, but we need some balance to the rapturous praise this film has received. Movie fans often accuse professional critics of being too harsh, but lately, I think critics have actually become too lenient. Mainstream movies get dumber, louder and tackier all the time, and they are increasingly substituting mawkishness for real emotion and character development. And yet the critics have given this thing a great Rotten Tomatoes rating! I guess we've all lowered our standards to rock bottom?",
    "I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on \"the list\" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like \"Superbad\", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of \"40 Year Old Virgin\", \"Superbad\", or \"Knocked Up\".<br/><br/>For starters, there was a definite presence of the \"TV actors on the big screen\" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of \"That 70s Show\" didn't follow her to \"Forgetting\"'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that \"Forgetting\" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than \"American Psycho 2\" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.<br/><br/>The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.<br/><br/>The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on \"CSI\") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious \"American Psycho 2\"); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with \"Superbad\"). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt \"Knocked Up\"). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write \"Fun with Dick and Jane\".<br/><br/>All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically.",
    "Eclipse is the beset Twilight movie so far and now I'm starting to give this series a little mercy. Yes, the writing is still bad, the CGI is awful, there's no chemistry between the leads, there's a lot of laughable dialogue, and terrible characters, but I enjoyed the movie and that's what movies are supposed to do. I'm actually going to watch the next movie with an open mind even if this movie wasn't that good.",
    "I'm a huge fan of the first Shrek and the second one also exceeded my expectations. Both of those movies had an meaningful and multidimensional plot. They also shared clever humor and for the most part unpredictable. I was extremely excited for the the third movie and I have to unfortunately say I was totally disappointed! The whole time I was waiting for it to start, like trying to convince myself, \"ok, any second now it will pick up\" - but it never did. The plot is so thin and unexciting - Prince Charming wants to takeover the throne while Shrek wants to get a young (King) Arthur to replace him as next in line to the throne. You never really feel any interest in what is happening or what will happen to the characters because you know exactly whats going to happen. Basically I spent the movie forcing myself to laugh because, hey, I was watching a Shrek movie. I know this review will not stop anyone who loved the previous movies from going to the third, but I just want to warn that its nothing to rush to or stand in line for.",
    "Talk about an appropriate title. <br/><br/>This is a collection of 11 short stories directed by indie stalwart Jim Jarmusch (\"Strangers in Paradise\", \"Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai\") that have been filmed over the last 18 years, all of which involve two or more characters simply sitting at a table, conversing over...yep, coffee and cigarettes. <br/><br/>In the hands of a lesser director that might be extremely boring, but Jarmusch is a master of subtle understatement and great deadpan humor. This may be one of the funniest movies you've ever seen in which no one cracks a smile. <br/><br/>Almost all the actors play themselves, which adds a meta-theatrical, slightly surreal touch to it all. <br/><br/>Among my favorite stories are one in which an overly eager Alfred Molina has a surprise in store for coolly arrogant fellow actor Steve Coogan and a great one in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin Shelby. Then there's the one where Tom Waits and Iggy Pop meet in a dive bar to discuss things and have a smoke (to celebrate quitting smoking), Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes experimenting with a Tesla coil, and in the funniest casting, RZA and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan sharing some downtime with, of all people, Bill Murray. I also like the one with Spike Lee's twin siblings, Joie and Cinque, dealing with an invasive waiter (a hilarious Steve Buscemi). Almost all the stories are excellent, but there are three that are very forgettable and pretty unnecessary, and they're all in a row, which disrupts the flow of the film. If those three had been taken out, \"Coffee and Cigarettes\" would be just about perfect, but it's still really good. And those three are out of the way in the first half, anyway.<br/><br/>\nFor the first hour the movie feels mainly just like fun. Straight-faced, deadpan, B&W comedy just like \"Strangers In Paradise\". But as it goes on, and strange connections are made between the stories, it seems to have a sudden dreamlike depth to it. <br/><br/>The final story in particular, in which two old men in a dark room (Bill Rice and Taylor Mead) discuss life while on a coffee break that feels like it'll last forever, has a distinct \"Waiting For Godot\" feel and ends the movie on a perfect note of haunting, existential sadness.<br/><br/>\nIt was at that point that I realized I hadn't just watched a string of jokey short stories, but a string of jokey short stories that say a lot about human nature and life in general. <br/><br/>And if that's not enough to interest you, how often do you get to see Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have a conversation? Or RZA, GZA, and Bill Murray?"

    "The Labour Party is facing heavy criticism over accusations of failing to honour a key campaign promise to voters, casting a shadow over its credibility.\n\nOpposition MPs and other critics have accused the party of making a \"broken pledge\" over a key policy commitment made during the general election campaign. Critics argue that the alleged U-turn is an indication that the party cannot be trusted to keep its promises, raising concerns about it potentially reneging on other commitments.\n\nThe exact policy in contention has not been mentioned, however, this alleged failure to follow-through on election promises has raised questions about the party’s commitment to its voters.\n\nA spokesman for the Conservative party said: \"This is a typical example of Labour saying one thing and doing another. It's clear that they cannot be trusted with delivering on their promises, nor to lead our country.”\n\nResponding to the accusations, a spokesperson for the Labour Party argued that the party remained committed to its pre-election pledges. They added that circumstances had changed since the election and the party was responding in the best possible way in light of the current national situation.\n\nThe spokesperson said, \"Disinformation is being spread about our commitments. We are dedicated to honouring our manifesto, but we must also adapt to changing circumstances. Sometimes that demands a shift in approach. That is not the same as breaking a pledge.\"\n\nThe spokesperson further reemphasized that policy realignment was sometimes necessary and this should not be seen as a deviation from commitment.\n\nPolitical analysts suggest that this controversy comes at a bad time for Labour, as the party seeks to strengthen its position in the face of various challenges, both across the UK and within their own ranks. This situation, they suggest, provides ammunition to the party's opposition and could potentially dent their standing in public opinion.\n\nHowever, Labour maintains its stance arguing that the party's ultimate commitment is to effectively respond to the needs of the country as circumstances evolve. It remains to be seen whether the party's core supporters and the general public will agree with this explanation, or view it as just an excuse for not fulfilling one of their main campaign promises. \n\nThe longer-term implications are yet unclear. How Labour handles this situation, and whether they are able to regain public trust, could significantly influence the political landscape in the months and years to come.\n",
    "England rugby star, Billy Robinson, has been ruled out of the upcoming Six Nations tournament due to a severe knee injury, dealing a significant blow to England's campaign.\n\nRobinson, who has been a key player for England in recent years, sustained the injury during a training session on Tuesday. Medical tests have confirmed that he has torn his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), an injury that typically requires several months of recovery.\n\nThe 28-year-old flanker's absence will be a major setback for England, who were hoping to build on their impressive performance in last year's tournament. Robinson's dynamic play and leadership skills have been instrumental in the team's recent successes.\n\nEngland head coach, Eddie Jones, expressed his disappointment at the news. \"Billy is an exceptional player who contributes so much to the team both on and off the field,\" he said. \"His absence will undoubtedly be felt, but it also provides an opportunity for other players to step up and show what they can do.\"\n\nJones added that Robinson's long-term health is the priority. \"We want Billy to take the time he needs to recover fully. We have a strong squad and we're confident in our ability to perform well in the Six Nations.\"\n\nRobinson's injury will likely see Tom Curry, another talented flanker, taking on a more prominent role in the team. Curry has previously impressed in the Six Nations and will be expected to fill the void left by Robinson.\n\nRobinson took to social media to express his disappointment at missing the tournament. \"Gutted to be missing the Six Nations, but I'll be cheering the boys on and working hard to get back on the pitch as soon as possible,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe Six Nations tournament, which features England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales, is set to begin on February 5th. Despite Robinson's injury, England remains one of the favourites to win the tournament.",
    "Campaigners and politicians across Europe are urging the European Union (EU) to intensify efforts to clamp down on fraud within its borders, amid mounting concerns over the scale and impact of such activities.\n\nReports suggest that fraud is costing the bloc billions of euros each year. According to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), approximately €500 million was diverted from the EU budget due to fraudulent activities in 2020 alone. However, critics claim that the actual figure could be much higher as many cases go undetected.\n\nThe call for action comes as a number of high-profile scandals have hit headlines in recent months, sparking outrage and intensifying concerns over the EU's ability to prevent and manage fraud. Cases have ranged from corruption and money laundering to tax evasion and benefit fraud.\n\nOne notable scandal involved a multinational corporation accused of exploiting loopholes in EU tax laws to evade hundreds of millions of euros in taxes. Another recent incident involved allegations of significant misuse of EU funds by a high-ranking government official in one of the member states.\n\nCritics argue that these cases highlight systemic issues within the EU regarding fraud prevention and management. They claim that there currently lacks sufficient regulation, transparency, and oversight within the bloc's financial systems, making it easier for fraudsters to operate.\n\nIn response to the growing pressure, several EU figures have pledged to bolster the bloc's fraud prevention measures. Frans Timmermans, the Vice President of the European Commission, acknowledged the severity of the issue, stating: \"We need to take strong measures to ensure the integrity of our financial systems and protect the bloc's budget, which is funded by our taxpayers.\"\n\nTimmermans outlined plans to establish a robust, cohesive, and transparent anti-fraud framework across the EU. This would involve improving cooperation between member states, enhancing data sharing procedures, tightening regulations, and implementing stronger penalties for those found guilty of fraud.\n\nNonetheless, implementing such changes may not be straightforward. Any attempts to increase regulation and oversight are likely to face opposition from those who view it as an infringement on national sovereignty.\n\nDespite potential challenges, campaigners are urging swift action, arguing that failure to effectively combat fraud could undermine trust in the EU and damage its international reputation. \n\nThe EU must now grapple with crafting an effective response to these concerns that balances the need for greater oversight with respect for the autonomy of its member states. In doing so, it will be addressing not only the immediate financial losses from fraud but also its broader implications for the bloc's social and political stability.",
    "Supermarket giant Sainsbury's has announced a financial donation to the Labour Party ahead of the pending elections, marking a significant shift in their political affiliations.\n\nTraditionally, Sainsbury’s has been associated with the Conservative party, with the Sainsbury family known to have made generous donations over several decades. This makes the announcement all the more surprising. The exact amount of the donation has not been disclosed, but it is said to be 'substantial'.\n\nThe move comes as a major boost for the Labour Party, which has faced struggles with fundraising in recent years. A Sainsbury's spokesperson explained the decision, saying, \"We believe in supporting a diverse range of voices in political discourse. This donation comes as part of our broader commitment to social and economic equality.\"\n\nThe Labour Party has warmly welcomed the contribution, expressing gratitude and optimism about what this could mean for their campaign. A spokesperson for the Labour party applauded, “This contribution from such a major player in the UK business environment demonstrates confidence in our party's economic policies.”\n\nOn the other hand, the move has been criticised by the Conservative Party. A spokesperson from the party expressed disappointment over Sainsbury's decision. “Sainsbury’s always had a good relationship with the Conservative party. We believe in making business-friendly policies and this move is unexpected,\" they said.\n\nThe supermarket chain, however, clarified that the contribution should not be viewed as an endorsement of the Labour Party's entire political agenda. A statement issued by Sainsbury’s stated, “We don't endorse every policy of any political party. We believe that a robust, democratic system is in the best interest of all UK businesses and society.”\n\nSainsbury's is one of Britain's leading supermarket brands with a significant influence over consumers. This move could potentially spark a series of high-profile donations from businesses to the Labour Party, thereby shifting the party's financial landscape and impacting the dynamics of the upcoming election.\n\nThe decision from Sainsbury’s also comes amid growing debates about political funding in the UK. The controversy surrounding campaign finance clearly shows the importance of transparency in political donations, a topic likely to gain more scrutiny in the wake of this unexpected announcement. \n\nWe are yet to see what influence Sainsbury's move has on the forthcoming election and what this might mean for the relationship between big business and politics in the UK.",
    "Talks aimed at resolving the ongoing pension strike have reached a deadlock, with both sides failing to reach an agreement. The strike, which has seen thousands of workers across the country down tools, is now set to continue into its third week.\n\nThe dispute centres around proposed changes to the pension scheme, which unions argue will leave their members worse off in retirement. Employers, on the other hand, maintain that the changes are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the pension fund.\n\nNegotiations between the unions and employers have been ongoing for several weeks, but have so far failed to produce a resolution. Both sides have accused each other of intransigence, with the unions claiming that employers are refusing to consider alternative proposals, while employers argue that the unions are unwilling to accept the need for change.\n\nThe stalemate has led to widespread disruption, with strikes affecting a range of sectors, from public transport to education. Many workers have expressed frustration at the lack of progress in the talks, with some warning that they are prepared to continue striking for as long as it takes to secure a fair deal.\n\nThe government has urged both sides to return to the negotiating table and find a resolution to the dispute. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \"It is deeply regrettable that these talks have reached a stalemate. We urge both sides to continue negotiations in good faith, with the aim of reaching a fair and sustainable solution.\"\n\nHowever, with neither side showing any sign of backing down, it appears that the strike could continue for some time yet. This raises the prospect of further disruption for the public, as well as increasing financial pressure on the striking workers.\n\nThe unions have called for a national day of action next week, in a bid to increase pressure on the employers. Meanwhile, employers have warned that the ongoing strike action is damaging the economy and have called on the unions to reconsider their position.\n\nAs the stalemate continues, the impact of the strike is being felt across the country. With no resolution in sight, the public can only wait and hope that a compromise can be found soon.",
    "Acclaimed director Mira Nair, known for her extraordinary visual storytelling, is diving into an ambitious new territory. Departing from her usual narratives, set in the intricate societal settings of India, she is embarking on a unique project which goes well beyond her regular thematic arena. The new project, dubbed 'Vanity' by the director herself, further proves her prowess in interpreting and presenting human psyche and interpersonal relationships in an ingenious manner.\n\nDeftly known for her films like \"Monsoon Wedding\" and \"The Namesake\", Nair's exploration of human interactions has always resonated with her audience, resulting in a strong international following. Now, with Vanity, she is venturing into a realm that she hasn't touched before - the complex infusion of modern technology into the intimacies of our daily lives.\n\nWithout revealing too much about the film's plot, Nair shared, \"Vanity, for me, metaphorically stands for the digital age's illusory self-worship. It surprisingly unravels underlying insecurities, vulnerabilities, and the deep-rooted desire for validation in each of us.\"\n\nThe project has been attracting interest from the film fraternity due to its unique approach to address the intricacies of human emotion against the backdrop of the digital domain, a first for Nair. Academy award-winning actor, Anthony Hopkins has shown interest in playing a principal role subject to his commitments while Kate Winslet has reportedly been roped in for a major character.\n\nIn true Nair fashion, the movie's production design is set to be subtle yet intricate, showcasing well-detailed sets that encapsulate the essence of a digitised world. The renowned cinematographer, Roger Deakins, who previously collaborated with Nair on 'The Namesake', has been brought on board to bring Nair's vision to life.\n\nThe film is still in its scripting stage and with Nair’s reputation for immaculate storytelling and layered characterisation, Vanity is keenly awaited by both fans and critics alike. As the director famous for pushing boundaries takes on the contemporary reality of digital obsession, cinephiles around the world keep their fingers crossed for another classic from Nair.\n\nHowever, like any other project of this magnitude and novelty, Vanity is seen as a substantial risk. Critics have pointed out that it largely departs from Nair's consistent themes of culture, tradition, and the societal pressure that reflects in her films. Yet, if there's one thing that Nair has proven, it's her ability to adapt, evolve and push the boundaries of her work",
    "In an ambitious move to combat poverty, the Indian government has rolled out a comprehensive budget aimed at disrupting the persistent cycle of deprivation among its distressed citizens. The anti-poverty budget, set to address critical issues of income inequality across the country, symbolises a renewed focus towards Social-Security led growth.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her annual budget speech in the parliament unveiled a raft of pro-poor policies that will pour billions of rupees into the rural economy, health sector, and other critical social services. Among the eye-catching measures being proposed are substantial hikes in spending on public health and education, significant boosting welfare payments, and increased financing to housing and urban development programs.\n\nBoosting rural incomes is among the critical concerns addressed through this budget. Creating more employment opportunities in rural areas is seen as a strategic move to facilitate reverse migration of workers who moved to cities and suffered during the Covid-19 lockdown periods. The rural jobs program is set to receive more than $8 billion, a nearly fifty percent increase compared with the previous budget.\n\nThe budget also includes heavy investments in universal healthcare, setting aside nearly $30 billion for health-and-wellness centres across the nation by the end of the current financial year. This initiative places special emphasis on strengthening health care in rural areas where medical facilities remain largely inaccessible for most of the population.\n\nAnother crucial announcement is the expansion of the nation's affordable housing scheme, with an emphasis on urban areas where the housing crisis is more pronounced. The Finance Minister pledged to deliver affordable housing for all urban poor by 2022. \n\nEducation, claiming a significant slice of the budget, plans to improve and expand access to quality education for underprivileged children across the country. The government has set aside an unprecedented sum to this sector, promising an innovative approach to ensure children in remote areas benefit from the digital revolution.\n\nReaction to the budget has been mixed. While many praise the bold step towards poverty alleviation, critics argue about the risks of the budget deficit. However, the government stands firm on the priorities set forth in the budget, expressing confidence in long-term economic growth brought about by investment in human and social capital.\n\nIt is clear that the government has prioritised alleviating poverty and reducing inequality over short-term economic yardsticks with this budget. The measure will certainly go some way in helping stressed and disadvantaged segments of Indian society while reflecting India's commitment to achieving Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations.\n\nThe success of these measures, however, will critically depend on how effectively they are implemented and the resilience of the Indian",
    "Spanish football giants Real Madrid are reportedly in negotiations over a possible move for Danish international footballer Thomas Gravesen. The club, renowned worldwide for its collection of top-tier footballing talent, famously tagged as 'Galacticos', appears keen on enlisting the services of the Everton midfielder as they look to strengthen their midfield options.\n\nGravesen, who is currently playing for English Premier League side Everton, has been in consistent form this season, catching the eyes of several top European clubs. However, it's the La Liga leaders Real Madrid who are reportedly leading the race for his signature.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been one of the standout performers for Everton this season, helping the Merseyside club compete at the upper end of the Premier League. Moreover, his combative presence in the midfield alongside a decent goal-scoring record has made him one of the most sought-after midfielders in Europe.\n\nA move to Real Madrid would certainly be a huge step-up for Gravesen. The Spanish side boasts an illustrious history and a current line-up full of star-studded players including Ronaldo, Luis Figo, David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, amongst others. However, the Everton star seems unfazed by the challenge, proving his worth at both club level and on the international stage for Denmark.\n\nDetails over the possible transfer fees have not been disclosed, but given Real Madrid's reputation for securing top talent at considerable prices, a significant sum could be involved. Gravesen, who has a contract with Everton until the summer of 2006, has yet to comment on the reports.\n\nWhen approached for comments, both clubs, Everton and Real Madrid, chose to maintain silence over the ongoing speculation. The winter transfer window has just opened, and if the rumours turn true, this could be one of the biggest moves happening during this period.\n\nMore updates will follow as information becomes available.\n",
    "Shares in MCI Inc., the US telecommunications giant, have surged after it received a takeover bid, sending its stock to a two-year high.\n\nAn undisclosed bidder, described as a 'major telecommunications company', is reported to have made an unsolicited $6.25 billion bid for MCI. This comes less than a year after the firm emerged from the significant financial scandal that resulted in its bankruptcy in 2002.\n\nThe news resulted in a 24% rise in the MCI's stock to $21.78 in New York trading on Monday, its highest price since June 2002, valuing the company at around $5.6 billion. More than 85 million shares changed hands, over five times the average daily volume.\n\nThough the potential deal would still require regulatory approval, the takeover bid signals the confidence in the company's ability to recover from its previous financial misfortunes.\n\nIndustry insiders have speculated that the prospective purchaser could be one of the handful of major US telecoms providers looking to increase their enterprise customer base in the much-fragmented market. The anonymised bid has spurred a wave of speculation around rival firms such as AT&T and Verizon Communications.\n\n\"The bid represents a huge vote of confidence in MCI's performance over the last year,\" said Patrick Comack, an analyst at Zachary Research. \"The premium offered by the undisclosed firm illustrates the perceived value of MCI's existing customer base and potential for future development.\"\n\nMCI has declined to provide a further comment about the ongoing negotiations, leaving market players eagerly waiting for more concrete information.\n\nMCI, formerly known as WorldCom, was at the heart of one of the biggest financial scams in the US history, which resulted in the company filing for bankruptcy. It emerged from Chapter 11 protection last year after reporting over $11 billion in fraudulent accounting adjustments.\n\nMCI's improved business structure and changes in its corporate governance have helped it regain its foothold in the market. This takeover bid, if successful, could potentially herald a new chapter in MCI's history, proving that a company can reinvent itself after a full-scale financial scandal.",
    "Argentina has successfully completed a debt restructuring deal worth $102.6bn, marking a significant step in the country's efforts to revive its struggling economy. The deal, which was announced by the country's Economy Minister, Martin Guzman, will provide Argentina with much-needed relief from its crippling debt burden.\n\nThe debt swap involves exchanging bonds that were issued under foreign laws for new bonds. The new bonds have different terms, including lower interest rates and longer maturity periods. This move is expected to ease the pressure on Argentina's public finances, allowing the government to focus on reviving the economy.\n\nArgentina has been grappling with a severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The country defaulted on its sovereign debt for the ninth time in its history in May 2020. The debt restructuring deal is seen as a crucial step towards stabilising the economy and regaining the confidence of international investors.\n\nThe agreement was reached after months of negotiations with major creditors, including BlackRock, Ashmore, and Fidelity. The creditors had initially rejected Argentina's proposals, demanding better terms. However, the government stood firm, arguing that it could not afford to pay more.\n\nThe deal was finally accepted by 99% of the creditors, according to the Economy Ministry. This high acceptance rate will allow Argentina to move forward with the debt swap without facing legal challenges from holdout creditors.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is Argentina's largest single creditor, welcomed the deal. The Fund's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said the agreement would \"contribute to restoring debt sustainability\" in Argentina.\n\nHowever, despite the successful debt swap, Argentina still faces significant economic challenges. The country's economy is expected to contract by 12% this year, according to the IMF. Unemployment and poverty rates are also on the rise.\n\nThe government has pledged to implement a series of economic reforms to boost growth and reduce poverty. These include measures to increase investment in infrastructure, improve the business environment, and strengthen social safety nets.\n\nThe successful debt swap is a major achievement for Argentina. However, the country's long-term economic recovery will depend on the government's ability to implement these reforms effectively and regain the confidence of international investors.",
    "Low-cost airlines have dealt a significant blow to Eurotunnel, the company that operates the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France. The rise of budget air travel has led to a significant decrease in the number of passengers using the tunnel, causing a drop in revenue for the company.\n\nEurotunnel has reported a 4% decrease in passenger numbers in the last year, with the company attributing this decline to the increasing popularity of low-cost airlines. The company's annual report revealed that passenger numbers fell from 10.3 million in the previous year to 9.9 million.\n\nThe rise of budget airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet has revolutionised the travel industry, offering cheap flights across Europe. This has posed a significant challenge to Eurotunnel, which has traditionally relied on a steady stream of passengers travelling between the UK and mainland Europe.\n\nEurotunnel's Chief Executive, Jacques Gounon, acknowledged the impact of low-cost airlines on the company's performance. \"The growth of low-cost airlines is a challenge we cannot ignore,\" he said. \"We need to adapt and innovate to ensure we remain competitive.\"\n\nDespite the decrease in passenger numbers, Eurotunnel's freight business has remained stable, with the company transporting 1.6 million trucks in the last year, a slight increase from the previous year. This has helped to offset some of the losses from the passenger business.\n\nIn response to the challenge posed by low-cost airlines, Eurotunnel has launched a series of initiatives aimed at attracting more passengers. These include a new flexible ticketing system, improved customer service, and partnerships with tourism operators to offer package deals.\n\nHowever, some industry analysts have questioned whether these measures will be enough to counter the threat from low-cost airlines. \"The travel industry is changing rapidly, and Eurotunnel needs to do more than just tweak its business model,\" said transport analyst, Paul Charles. \"It needs to fundamentally rethink how it operates.\"\n\nThe company has also been hit by other challenges, including Brexit-related uncertainty and ongoing security issues at the Calais terminal. These factors have further complicated Eurotunnel's efforts to boost passenger numbers.\n\nDespite these challenges, Gounon remains optimistic about the company's future. \"We are confident that we can adapt to the changing market conditions and continue to provide a vital link between the UK and mainland Europe,\" he said.",
    "Electronic Arts (EA), one of the world's leading video game companies, has announced plans to expand its operations into the film and television industry. This move is set to position EA as a direct competitor to major film and television giants such as Netflix, Disney, and HBO.\n\nEA, known for popular video game franchises like FIFA, Madden NFL, and Battlefield, has a vast library of intellectual property that it can adapt for the big and small screens. The company's decision to venture into the film and television industry is seen as a strategic move to leverage its existing content and fan base.\n\nThe company's Chief Studios Officer, Laura Miele, stated in a recent interview, \"We have a wealth of compelling stories and characters that we believe would make for entertaining and engaging viewing experiences. Our goal is to create high-quality content that resonates with our audience and brings our games to life in a new way.\"\n\nEA's move into the film and television industry follows a trend of other video game companies making similar moves. Ubisoft, for example, has seen success with its Rabbids Invasion animated series and is currently developing a film based on its Assassin's Creed franchise.\n\nHowever, EA's entry into this space is not without challenges. The company will need to navigate the complexities of the film and television industry, including production, distribution, and marketing. Additionally, while video game adaptations have seen increased popularity, they have a mixed track record in terms of critical and commercial success.\n\nDespite these challenges, EA is optimistic about its prospects. The company believes that its strong brand recognition and loyal fan base will provide a solid foundation for its film and television ventures.\n\n\"We're excited about the potential of this new venture,\" Miele said. \"We believe that our unique storytelling and immersive gameplay can translate well to film and television, providing new ways for fans to engage with our franchises.\"\n\nEA has yet to announce specific projects or timelines, but fans can expect to see their favourite video game characters and stories on their screens in the not-too-distant future.

    "A prodigious feat occurred in the film industry as \"Miggy: A Cherub's Tale,\" became a front-runner for Best Picture at the Oscars even though its protagonist is just 18 months old.\n\nLittle Miggy Lane, an extraordinary baby is grabbing major attention and making headlines as the heart of \"Miggy: A Cherub's Tale.\" In an unprecedented move, the Academy has taken notice of this atypical, youthful talent.\n\n\"Miggy: A Cherub's Tale\" is an astonishingly moving film that chronicles the first year of Miggy's life. Using a smart blend of cutting-edge technology and innovative storytelling techniques, the film intimately captures the universal journey of early childhood development.\n\nCritics and audiences alike are marvelling at the sonorous laughter, joyful antics, and candid innocence so authentically displayed by Miggy on the screen. His expressions in the scenes where he takes his first steps, says his first words, and explores his surrounding world have struck a deeply emotional chord with viewers.\n\nHelmed by skilled director Harry Goldfinch, the film offers a refreshingly unique take on storytelling. \"We wanted to bring out the innocence and wisdom that a baby can teach us, remind us those simple joys of life that are often overlooked,\" says Goldfinch.  \n\nThe Academy's recognition of \"Miggy: A Cherub's Tale\" could potentially challenge the traditional norms of acting categories. Miggy, despite being a toddler, has been put forth for Best Actor consideration. His nomination would be groundbreaking, underlining the evolving perceptions of performance art.\n\nThis year, the Oscar race includes movies that have toyed with storytelling conventions and pushed the definition of a leading performance. From animated poles to bilingual role-playing, the frontier of film criteria appears to be expanding.\n\nHowever, \"Miggy: A Cherub's Tale\" taking centre stage is perhaps the most unexpected of all. It's also a testament to the universal resonance of childlike wonder and innocence.\n\nAs the Oscars approach, all eyes will be on Miggy and his emotional portrait of childhood. Success at the Academy Awards could inspire a whole new genre of films, focusing on the lives and experiences of our youngest stars.\n\nRegardless of whether it takes home the coveted golden statue, \"Miggy: A Cherub's Tale\" has already made its mark, proving that talent knows no age. This charming film - and its baby star - have created a ripple in the cinematic world that won't soon be forgotten.",
    "The UK economy has shown greater resilience than previously predicted, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The figures indicate a robust performance across several sectors, defying earlier forecasts of a slowdown.\n\nThe ONS reported that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.6% in the last quarter, surpassing the 0.5% growth predicted by economists. This marks the third consecutive quarter where the economy has outperformed expectations.\n\nThe stronger-than-expected performance was largely driven by the services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the UK's economic activity. The sector grew by 0.8%, its fastest pace in nearly two years. Manufacturing also showed signs of recovery, expanding by 0.4% after two consecutive quarters of contraction.\n\nThe construction sector, however, continued to struggle, contracting by 0.7%. Despite this, the overall economic picture remains positive.\n\nThe ONS's head of GDP, Rob Kent-Smith, said: \"Services again led the way with construction also performing well. Manufacturing also boosted the economy with an improved performance after a weak second quarter.\"\n\nThe stronger economic performance could ease pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates. The central bank had previously hinted at a rate cut if the economy continued to weaken.\n\nHowever, some economists warn that the current strength of the economy could be temporary. They argue that the growth could be due to stockpiling ahead of the Brexit deadline, which could lead to a slowdown in the coming months.\n\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"The pick-up in GDP growth in the third quarter probably overstates the underlying health of the economy.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the latest figures are likely to boost confidence in the UK's economic resilience amid ongoing Brexit uncertainty.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, welcomed the news, stating: \"Today's figures are another sign that despite the challenges across the globe, the fundamentals of the British economy are strong.\"\n\nThe government has pledged to continue its investment in infrastructure and public services to support the economy. However, it also acknowledges the need for caution given the potential economic impact of Brexit and other global uncertainties.",

    "Continental Airlines, one of the largest carriers in the United States, has warned that it may run out of cash due to the ongoing financial crisis. The airline has been hit hard by the economic downturn, with a significant drop in passenger numbers and a sharp rise in fuel costs.\n\nIn a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the airline stated that it had $2.6bn (£1.7bn) in unrestricted cash and short-term investments at the end of September. However, it also warned that it could face a cash crunch if the current economic conditions persist.\n\n\"The current financial crisis has created a very difficult operating environment for us,\" the airline said in the filing. \"If these conditions continue, we may not be able to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and continue our operations.\"\n\nContinental, like many other airlines, has been struggling to cope with the double whammy of falling demand and rising costs. The airline has already taken several measures to cut costs, including reducing its flight schedule and laying off staff.\n\nThe airline industry has been one of the hardest hit by the financial crisis, with several airlines already filing for bankruptcy. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has predicted that the global airline industry will lose $5.6bn this year.\n\nContinental's warning comes just days after American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, reported a third-quarter loss of $360m. The airline also warned that it could face a cash crunch if the economic downturn continues.\n\nThe US government has already stepped in to help the struggling airline industry, with a $25bn bailout package. However, some analysts have warned that this may not be enough to save some airlines from bankruptcy.\n\nContinental's shares fell by more than 7% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

    "Two senior executives at Fannie Mae, the US government-backed mortgage finance company, have resigned, according to an announcement made by the firm. The departures come at a time when the company is grappling with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has triggered a wave of home loan defaults.\n\nChief Executive Officer Hugh Frater and Chief Financial Officer Celeste Brown have stepped down from their roles, the company said in a statement. The reasons for their resignations were not immediately clear, and Fannie Mae did not provide further details.\n\nFrater, who has been with Fannie Mae since 2016, served as CEO for three years. Brown, on the other hand, joined the company in 2017 and was appointed CFO in 2018. Their departures mark a significant leadership shakeup at the mortgage giant.\n\nFannie Mae, along with its smaller sibling Freddie Mac, plays a crucial role in the US housing market, buying and guaranteeing mortgages from lenders. This allows lenders to make more loans to homebuyers. However, the pandemic has put significant pressure on the company, with a surge in mortgage defaults and requests for forbearance.\n\nThe company has appointed David Benson, currently President, as the interim CEO and Michael Bathon, currently Vice President and Deputy Chief Financial Officer, as the interim CFO. The board will conduct a search for permanent replacements.\n\n\"The board is confident that David and Michael will provide strong leadership and continuity as we navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead,\" said Sheila Bair, Chair of Fannie Mae's Board of Directors.\n\nThe departures come at a critical time for Fannie Mae, as the Biden administration is expected to make significant changes to the housing finance system. The administration has signaled that it wants to end the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which has been in place since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe resignations also follow a period of intense scrutiny for Fannie Mae, which has faced criticism over its handling of the pandemic's impact on homeowners.

    "The increasing accessibility and affordability of high-speed broadband connections is transforming the traditional landscape of television viewing, a trend which may pose a serious competition to traditional TV broadcasters. \n\nThis shift is powered by streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, which allow audiences to enjoy their favourite shows, movies and documentaries at any time and from any location. By offering tailored content recommendations based on user interests and viewing behaviour, these platforms provide a personalised user experience which is often lacking in traditional broadcasting.\n\nResearch from Ofcom reveals an upward trajectory in the number of UK households opting for streaming subscriptions, overtaking the number who only watch broadcast television. In the first quarter of 2020, for example, Ofcom noted that nearly 15 million households in the UK had subscribed to Netflix, up from 11.2 million in the same period the year before. In contrast, traditional TV broadcasters saw their audience numbers dwindle.\n\nStreaming services are capitalising on the high-speed broadband internet, which has become a standard feature in most homes across the UK. Unlike the traditional broadcasting model, which requires a specific broadcasting time slot, the streaming model gives the user the liberty of choosing when and what to watch, thus offering unprecedented levels of convenience and flexibility.\n\nMoreover, streaming services offer high-quality, original content at competitive pricing, which is often less than the cost of a standard TV license. Combined with the appeal of ad-free viewing, this factors into making streaming platforms a compelling alternative to traditional television.\n\nTo keep up with this paradigm shift, several traditional TV broadcasters have forayed into the streaming arena. For instance, the BBC and ITV have joined forces to launch BritBox, a new streaming service offering the \"best of British\" television to their audiences.\n\nHowever, experts argue that this shift in viewer preference does not mean the immediate end for traditional TV. Many viewers, particularly from the older generation, continue to rely on broadcast television for their news and entertainment needs. The live nature of sports, news and event programming also offers a unique appeal that streaming can't substitute.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of broadband and streaming services signals a monumental transition in how we consume media. It's an evolving landscape with plenty of room for both streaming platforms and traditional TV to reshape and redefine their offerings in a bid to attract and retain viewers.",
    "The year 2004 was indeed a memorable year for Irish athletics, marking significant achievements and remarkable performances by athletes that not only made the nation proud but also elevated the status of Irish sports on the global platform. \n\nWhile the world watched in awe, Sonia O'Sullivan, a veteran star of Irish Athletics, added an extra feather to her illustrious career by taking part in her fifth and final Olympic Games. The County Cork runner, long-reputed for her talent and tenacity, represented Ireland for one last time on the international platform and gave a respectable performance despite struggling with fitness problems. Part of her unforgettable legacy was enhanced in 2004, reminding the world and Irish youths of the potential for greatness. \n\nMeanwhile, young blood was already drawing much attention to itself. A rising star, Alistair Cragg showed exceptional enthusiasm and talent. After a disappointment in the Olympics, where he failed to make it past the heats in the 1500 metres, he brilliantly bounced back to smash the Irish record in the 3000 metres and secured his place as one of the iconic runners in the making. \n\nThere were also some notable contributions in field events. Cork’s Robert Heffernan, an accomplished race walker, provided another memorable moment when he broke the Irish record for the 20km walk in the Summer Olympics in Athens. Despite finishing eighth, his achievement brought immense pride and indeed, showed promise of better days to come for Irish field events.\n\nIn addition, there were numerous achievements by Irish athletes at the European Championships and other international meets. The performance of Ireland’s 4x400m relay team at the Olympics, which advanced to the final and finished in seventh place, displayed the depth of talent within the nation. Gillian O'Sullivan, the silver medalist at the 2003 World Championships unfortunately had to sit out this year due to injury, yet her past accomplishments continued to inspire other Irish Athletes. \n\nOn a grassroots level, the ongoing commitment to athletic development across Ireland was reflected in increased participation in school and district level championships, further underscoring the vibrant health of athletics.\n\nThe year 2004, thus, not only highlighted the powerful performances of Irish athletes but also signified a critical turning point for Irish athletics. Just as Sonia O'Sullivan's illustrious career was drawing to a close, new talents such as Alistair Cragg and Robert Heffernan were paving the way for the next generation of Irish athletes. \n\nIreland found its heroes, observed its potential and looked forward to",
    "The Conservative Party has announced a new initiative to provide free sports lessons to children across the UK, in a bid to tackle childhood obesity and promote physical fitness. The pledge is part of the party's broader strategy to improve public health and reduce strain on the NHS.\n\nUnder the proposed scheme, children aged between 5 and 16 will be eligible for free sports lessons, with a focus on encouraging participation in a wide range of activities. The Tories believe that by making sports lessons more accessible, they can help to instil a lifelong love of physical activity in children and young people.\n\nThe initiative is expected to be funded by a combination of government investment and partnerships with private sports organisations. The Tories have not yet provided specific details about the cost of the scheme, but have stated that it will be included in their next budget.\n\nThe Health Secretary, who announced the pledge, said: \"We are committed to improving the health and wellbeing of our nation's children. By providing free sports lessons, we can help to tackle the obesity crisis and encourage children to lead active, healthy lives.\"\n\nThe announcement has been welcomed by many health and sports organisations. The CEO of UK Active, a not-for-profit health body, said: \"This is a positive step towards addressing the physical inactivity epidemic among young people. We look forward to seeing the details of the scheme and working with the government to ensure its success.\"\n\nHowever, the Labour Party has criticised the pledge, arguing that it does not go far enough. The Shadow Health Secretary said: \"While we welcome any initiative that promotes physical activity, the Tories are simply papering over the cracks. We need a comprehensive strategy to tackle childhood obesity, not just free sports lessons.\"\n\nThe pledge comes amid growing concern about the levels of childhood obesity in the UK. According to the latest figures from the NHS, nearly a third of children aged 2 to 15 are overweight or obese. The Tories hope that their initiative will help to reverse this trend and promote a healthier lifestyle among the nation's youth.\n\nThe free sports lessons are expected to begin in the next academic year, with further details to be announced in the coming months.",
    "In an adrenaline-packed match, Ireland have triumphed over England with a six-point lead, finishing the match at 19-13. The victory has undoubtedly reinforced the dominance and excellence of Irish rugby.\n\nIreland opened the match with fierce determination, aiming to reclaim their standing after their defeat against Scotland last week. The English side, however, made a slow start, struggling to keep up with the pace set by the Irish. \n\nIrish fly-half, Johnny Sexton, proved instrumental in the side's victory, contributing an impressive 14 points through his reliably accurate boot. He also successfully converted a penalty five minutes before halftime, providing Ireland with a critical edge.\n\nWith a cheering home crowd fuelling their courage, the Irish did not let their guard down in the second half. Tadhg Beirne’s evasion of English defence resulted in a splendid try, effectively raising Ireland's score and hopes of winning the match.\n\nHowever, England did not surrender without showcasing their own skills. Owen Farrell responded with a couple of well-aimed penalty kicks that briefly bolstered English hopes. Anthony Watson also came through with an impeccably timed try, but it was not enough to turn the tide in their favour.\n\nDespite a late surge from England, Ireland's defence remained unyielding. Though Eddie Jones' side managed to close the scoreline to a six-point lead, they failed to monster a match-levelling try in the final minutes.\n\nIreland coach, Andy Farrell, was undoubtedly pleased with the outcome. \"We played with spirit and determination. Our hard work during the week paid off,\" he said in a post-match interview.\n\nThe defeat serves as a significant blow to England's title ambitions. Meanwhile, this victory is a massive surge forward for Ireland, positioning them in a more favourable light for the rest of the championship.\n\nFans worldwide are eagerly awaiting the upcoming games, as the nature of this year's championship remains unpredictable and enthralling. No doubt, Ireland will be entering their next match with renewed confidence after this significant victory.\n",
    "The Conservative Party has launched a scathing attack on the government's handling of burglary offences, accusing it of making 'U-turns' on its policies. The Tories claim that the government's approach to tackling burglary is inconsistent and ineffective, leading to a lack of confidence in the justice system.\n\nThe criticism comes in the wake of recent statistics showing a rise in burglary offences across the country. The Tories argue that the government's response to this increase has been marked by a series of policy reversals, which they claim have undermined efforts to tackle the problem.\n\nShadow Home Secretary, who led the attack, said: \"The government's approach to burglary is a mess. They make grand announcements about cracking down on burglars, only to backtrack later. This lack of consistency is undermining public confidence in our justice system.\"\n\nThe Conservatives have pointed to several instances where they believe the government has reversed its stance on burglary. These include a proposal to increase the maximum sentence for burglary, which was later abandoned, and a pledge to introduce tougher penalties for repeat offenders, which was subsequently watered down.\n\nThe government, however, has defended its record on burglary. A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"We are committed to tackling burglary and have introduced a range of measures to help protect homeowners. These include increasing police funding, improving home security, and introducing new laws to crack down on repeat offenders.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"The claim that we have made 'U-turns' on burglary is simply not true. We have consistently taken tough action to tackle this crime and will continue to do so.\"\n\nThe row over burglary policy comes at a time when crime is likely to be a key issue in the upcoming general election. With the Tories keen to portray the government as soft on crime, and the government eager to defend its record, the debate over how best to tackle burglary is set to continue.",
    "After almost 56 years since the release of the much-loved classic, \"The Sound of Music,\" is returning to its roots in Salzburg, Austria. A new, immersive theatrical production of the beloved musical will be staged in the very place that inspired the original story, bringing the tale full circle.\n\nThe grand opening is scheduled for Summer 2023 at Salzburg State Theatre, promising audiences a unique and authentic experience. The renowned play, based on the memoir of Maria von Trapp, will unfold on an Austrian backdrop, reflecting the real-life story of the von Trapp family.\n\nArtistic Director Tadeusz von Moltke elaborated on the homecoming of the esteemed musical, \"To stage 'The Sound of Music' in Salzburg seems both like closing a cultural circle and a daring venture. We want to offer our audience an earnest interpretation of this story that is deeply rooted in our city.\"\n\nThe musical, with its evergreen numbers like \"Do-Re-Mi\", \"Edelweiss\", and the titular \"The Sound of Music\", has been celebrated worldwide, garnering five Tony Awards, including Best Musical. Its conversion into a film extended its legacy, and it won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n\nThe Sound of Music is based on the 1949 memoir \"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\" by Maria von Trapp. It narrates the life of the von Trapp family, who fled Austria during the Nazi regime and their subsequent life in America.\n\nThe story remains timeless and globally respected for its touching narrative of overcoming adversity through unity, resilience, and the power of music. This upcoming homecoming production aims to encapsively present Julie Andrews's Maria and Christopher Plummer's Captain von Trapp in a way that is respectful to the original while providing a fresh outlook for new audiences.\n\nThe Austrian audience and international tourists alike eagerly await the re-envisioned staging of the play. The show marks a significant moment as the famous hills of Salzburg once again reverberate with the \"Sound of Music\".\n\nWhen asked about the forthcoming production, Sophie Mitterer, a long-time fan of the musical residing in Salzburg, said, \"This is an exciting time for us.

    "A new, more affordable chip for mobile phones has been developed, promising to significantly reduce the cost of smartphones and potentially increase access to technology in developing countries.\n\nThe chip, developed by a team of engineers at the University of Cambridge, is said to be 40% cheaper to produce than current models. This could lead to a significant reduction in the retail price of smartphones, making them more accessible to a wider range of consumers.\n\nThe team used a novel manufacturing process that reduces the amount of silicon - a costly component of most chips - required. Instead, they used a cheaper, more abundant material, which they claim performs just as well.\n\n\"The new chip performs at a similar level to current chips, but at a fraction of the cost,\" said Dr. Robert Thompson, who led the research team. \"This could be a game-changer in terms of making smartphones and other mobile technology more affordable and accessible.\"\n\nThe development could have significant implications for the global smartphone market, which is currently dominated by a small number of manufacturers. If the new chip can be produced at scale, it could disrupt the market and potentially lead to a wider range of companies producing affordable smartphones.\n\nThe team's findings have been published in the journal Nature Electronics, and they are now working with industry partners to explore the potential for commercial production.\n\nThe development could also have a significant impact in developing countries, where the high cost of smartphones can be a barrier to access. By making smartphones more affordable, the new chip could help to bridge the digital divide and enable more people to access the internet and digital services.\n\n\"This is not just about making cheaper smartphones,\" said Dr. Thompson. \"It's about making technology more accessible and empowering people in developing countries to access digital services and opportunities.\"\n\nThe team is now working on further refining the chip and exploring other potential applications for their technology. They believe that their approach could also be used to reduce the cost of other types of electronic devices, potentially leading to a wider revolution in the electronics industry.",
    "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been given a significant financial boost ahead of the summer transfer window. The club's board has reportedly handed him a substantial 'war chest' to strengthen the squad for the upcoming season.\n\nThe Frenchman, who has been at the helm of the North London club for over two decades, is under pressure to deliver after a disappointing season. Arsenal finished outside the top four in the Premier League for the first time under Wenger's reign, leading to calls from some fans for a change in management.\n\nHowever, the board has shown faith in Wenger, providing him with a significant budget to bring in new talent. The exact amount of the war chest has not been disclosed, but it is believed to be in the region of £150 million.\n\nWenger has been criticised in the past for his reluctance to spend big in the transfer market. However, this summer could see a change in strategy, with the manager already linked with several high-profile players.\n\nAmong the potential targets are Monaco's teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe, Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette and Leicester City's Riyad Mahrez. Wenger is also reportedly keen on strengthening his defence, with Southampton's Virgil van Dijk and Juventus' Alex Sandro on his radar.\n\nThe Arsenal boss has previously stated that he is looking for \"top, top quality\" additions to his squad. With this war chest at his disposal, fans will be hoping that he can attract the calibre of players needed to challenge for the Premier League title next season.\n\nHowever, Wenger will also need to focus on keeping his current stars at the club. Key players such as Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil have been linked with moves away from the Emirates Stadium, and securing their futures will be a priority for the manager.\n\nThis summer promises to be a crucial one for Arsenal and Wenger. With a significant war chest to spend, the pressure is on to deliver a squad capable of challenging for major honours. Only time will tell if Wenger's summer spending spree can return Arsenal to the top of English football.",

    "The Mayor of a small town in the UK has refused to retract a controversial comment he made, comparing a local policy to Nazi Germany. Despite facing significant backlash, the Mayor has stood by his remarks, stating that they were intended to highlight what he perceives as an overreach of authority.\n\nThe Mayor, whose identity has been withheld due to the sensitive nature of the issue, made the comment during a town council meeting last week. He compared a proposed local regulation, which would limit the number of pets residents can own, to the oppressive policies of Nazi Germany.\n\nHis remarks were met with immediate criticism from fellow council members and the public, many of whom called for an immediate apology. Critics argue that the comparison was not only inappropriate but also trivialised the atrocities committed during the Holocaust.\n\nHowever, the Mayor has remained defiant, refusing to retract his statement. He argues that his comments were not intended to belittle the Holocaust but to draw attention to what he sees as an encroachment on personal freedoms.\n\n\"I stand by my comments,\" the Mayor said in a statement. \"I did not mean to offend anyone, and I certainly did not mean to trivialise the Holocaust. My intention was to highlight what I see as an overreach of authority. I believe that the proposed regulation is an infringement on our personal freedoms.\"\n\nThe Mayor's refusal to retract his comments has sparked a heated debate within the community. Some residents support his stance, arguing that the proposed regulation is indeed an overreach of authority. Others, however, believe that his comments were insensitive and inappropriate.\n\nThe controversy has also attracted the attention of national media and prominent figures within the Jewish community. The Chief Rabbi has condemned the Mayor's comments, stating that \"comparisons to Nazi Germany are always inappropriate and offensive, particularly when used in such a trivial context.\"\n\nThe local council is expected to discuss the matter further in a meeting next week. It remains to be seen whether the Mayor will face any disciplinary action for his comments.",

Wilkinson, who famously kicked the drop goal that won England the 2003 World Cup, will take over from Eddie Jones following the conclusion of the Six Nations tournament.\n\nWilkinson, 42, has been working as a skills coach with the England team since 2018, and his promotion to the top job marks a significant moment in his post-playing career. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of English rugby, and his appointment has been met with widespread approval from players and fans alike.\n\nRFU Chief Executive Bill Sweeney said in a statement: \"Jonny is a true legend of the game and his success as a player for England speaks for itself. We believe he has the vision, the passion and the knowledge to lead England to future success.\"\n\nWilkinson's first task as head coach will be to prepare the team for their summer tour of Australia. He will be expected to build on the progress made under Jones, who led England to the final of the 2019 World Cup and two Six Nations titles during his tenure.\n\nSpeaking about his appointment, Wilkinson said: \"I am incredibly honoured to be given this opportunity. I have always been passionate about English rugby and to be able to lead this team is a privilege. I am excited about the challenges ahead and look forward to working with the players and staff to continue to push this team forward.\"\n\nWilkinson's appointment comes at a time when English rugby is looking to rebuild after a disappointing Six Nations campaign. His experience and understanding of the game will be crucial as England look to re-establish themselves as one of the world's leading rugby nations.\n\nFormer England captain Lawrence Dallaglio described Wilkinson's appointment as a \"fantastic move\" for English rugby. \"Jonny has a deep understanding of the game and what it takes to succeed at the highest level,\" he said. \"I have no doubt he will bring the same dedication and commitment to his coaching role as he did as a player.\"\n\nWilkinson's tenure as England head coach will officially begin on 1 July, following the conclusion of the Six Nations tournament.",
    "Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has escalated a row with his critics, doubling down on the views that led to fierce scrutinizing of his final years in charge of the prestigious club.\n\nWenger, who left the Gunners in 2018 after 22 years in charge, told BBC Sport he absolutely stands by his decisions, which aimed to balance the club's financial health and on-pitch success.\n\nThe 71-year-old Frenchman's stance has increasingly attracted criticism as Arsenal has struggled to keep pace with England’s elite in recent years. Wenger's latter years were marred by fan protests and unrest over the perceived lack of investment in players.\n\nHowever, Wenger defended his position and his association with the club's board, who, he says, were not ready to throw money at the problem. \"I think I worked in a very honest and brave way,\" he said adding, \"It was important to make sure the club was safe for the future.\"\n\nHe also took a swipe at critics who, he says, are rushing to judge his successor Mikel Arteta despite the team's recent poor performances. \"In our job, you can look in two directions - the future and the day,\" Wenger said. \"People are always more focused on the day and it creates a lot of controversies and impatience.\"\n\nThe legacy of Wenger at Arsenal remains a talking point, with fans divided over the club's direction under his stewardship. However, Wenger insisted that his guiding principle had been what was best for Arsenal in the long run. \n\nDespite his controversial tenure, Wenger said he never thought about quitting Arsenal. \"I believe myself to be a fighter in my whole life; I've had to fight a lot to get what I wanted,\" he said. \"I've never considered giving up that fight.\" \n\nRegardless of the current row, Wenger's contribution to English football is undeniable, leading Arsenal to three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups, and overseeing the 'Invincibles' season in 2003-04 when the team went unbeaten in the league. However, his defence of his latter years at the helm continues to fuel the controversy and spark debate amongst English football fans and pundits.\n\nWhether Arsenal will find success after Wenger's reign, or whether the Frenchman's critics will be proven correct in their critiques, remains to be seen. Until then, the debate surrounding Wenger's final years at Arsenal, it seems, will continue to rage on.",
    "General Motors (GM), the world's largest carmaker, has issued a warning that its profits for 2005 will be significantly lower than previously forecasted. The Detroit-based company has attributed this to a slump in sales in North America and increased healthcare costs.\n\nGM now expects to make $1-$2 per share in 2005, down from its previous estimate of $4-$5. This news has led to a sharp fall in the company's shares, which dropped by 14% on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe company's North American operations have been hit hard by a decline in the sales of sports utility vehicles (SUVs), one of GM's most profitable product lines. The fall in sales is believed to be due to high petrol prices and increased competition from foreign carmakers.\n\nIn addition to the decline in sales, GM is also grappling with rising healthcare costs for its US workforce. The company is one of the largest private providers of health care in the US, and these costs have been a significant drain on its finances.\n\nGM's chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner, described 2005 as \"one of the most challenging years in GM's history\". He added that the company was \"not standing still\" and was taking \"tough but necessary actions\" to address its problems.\n\nThese actions include a plan to cut 30,000 jobs and close several plants in North America over the next few years. GM is also in talks with the United Auto Workers union about ways to reduce healthcare costs.\n\nDespite the gloomy forecast for 2005, Mr. Wagoner remains optimistic about the company's future. He said that GM was \"aggressively implementing\" its turnaround plan and was \"committed to turning our North American business around\".\n\nHowever, some analysts are sceptical about GM's ability to recover quickly. They argue that the company's problems are deep-rooted and will take time to fix. They also point out that GM is facing stiff competition from Asian carmakers, who are gaining market share in the US.\n\nThe profit warning from GM is the latest in a series of setbacks for the company. Last year, it lost its status as the world's largest carmaker to Toyota, and it has been struggling with a series of accounting scandals and lawsuits.",
    "The United Kingdom has emerged as the world's biggest music buyer, according to a recent report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The study reveals that the UK music industry is now worth an estimated £1.33 billion, surpassing the United States, which has traditionally held the top spot.\n\nThe report attributes this surge to the growing popularity of streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. The UK's digital music consumption has seen a significant increase, with 91% of the population now listening to music online.\n\nThe IFPI's report also highlights the UK's contribution to the global music scene, with British artists accounting for one in every eight albums sold worldwide. This is a testament to the global appeal of UK artists, from established acts like Ed Sheeran and Adele to emerging talents like Dua Lipa and Stormzy.\n\nFrances Moore, Chief Executive of IFPI, said: \"The UK is a global music powerhouse. The results of this report are a testament to the outstanding creativity of our artists, the resilience of our industry and the passion of music fans.\"\n\nThe report also indicates a shift in the way music is consumed. Physical sales have continued to decline, while digital sales and streaming have seen a significant increase. This trend is expected to continue, with streaming predicted to account for over half of all music consumption by 2023.\n\nThe UK government has recognised the importance of the music industry to the economy and has pledged to support its growth. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has announced a £1.57 billion recovery fund to help the music industry recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe UK's position as the world's biggest music buyer is a significant achievement and reflects the nation's love for music. It also highlights the importance of the music industry to the UK economy and the need for continued investment and support.\n\nHowever, despite the UK's success, the report also warns of the challenges facing the music industry. These include the need to ensure fair remuneration for artists and the impact of Brexit on the industry's ability to tour and trade freely.\n\nThe UK's music industry has shown remarkable resilience and adaptability in the face of these challenges. With continued support and investment, it is well-positioned to maintain its status as the world's biggest music buyer and continue its significant contribution to the global music scene.",

However, the European stage presents a different level of competition, with teams like Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich boasting world-class talent.\n\nGerrard's comments come ahead of Rangers' opening group stage match in the Europa League against Lyon. The French side, who reached the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2020, are considered one of the favourites to win the competition.\n\nDespite playing down his team's chances, Gerrard insisted that Rangers would not be overawed by the occasion. \"We're not here to make up the numbers,\" he said. \"We'll approach every game with the belief that we can get a result.\"\n\nThe former England international also highlighted the importance of the club's supporters in their European campaign. \"Our fans have been fantastic and their support will be crucial for us,\" he said. \"We'll need them every step of the way.\"\n\nWhile Gerrard's realism may dampen some fans' expectations, it also underlines the scale of the task facing Rangers in Europe.

    "A recent report revealing a startling upsurge in custody deaths in the United Kingdom has left Members of Parliament deeply shocked and concerned. Members from all political parties are calling for urgent investigations and reforms to halt this unsettling trend.\n\nIn the last year alone, recorded deaths in police custody, prisons, and immigration detention centres across the UK have spiked alarmingly. Detailed figures show that the number of deaths has increased by 25% compared to the previous year. These figures include instances of suicide, natural causes, and deaths under investigation concerning potentially inappropriate or negligent conduct.\n\nMps across the aisles have expressed their astonishment and deep concern over these alarming figures. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, tweeted \"Disturbing increase in deaths in custody - immediate action needed. The figures raise urgent questions about the support being provided.\"\n\nConservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley echoed Cooper's sentiments, stating, \"The death of any individual in custody is a cause for concern, let alone such a dramatic surge. These devastating statistics require urgent review and attention.\"\n\nRecent high-profile cases of alleged police negligence resulting in the deaths of individuals like Brian Ringrose and Leroy Junior Medford have further drawn the public’s attention to this, already volatile issue. Family members of these victims were present later in Parliament, urging for changes in the system.\n\nQuestions are being raised about police use of force, training, and whether appropriate mental health assessments and support are being provided to vulnerable detainees. It is believed that a significant proportion of the individuals who died in custody struggled with mental health issues or addiction – problems inadequately addressed in the current custodial system.\n\nCampaigners advocating for prisoners' rights have also voiced their dismay, pointing out a stark deterioration in the prison service. Frances Crook, CEO of the Howard League for Penal Reform, called it, \"An indication of a system in crisis, where basic humanity has been compromised.\"\n\nIn response to the outcry, the Minister for Crime and Policing, Kit Malthouse MP, promised a review of the concerning data. \"It is vital that every individual in custody is treated humanely and fairly,\" he stated. \"We are committed to reducing custody deaths, ensuring the safety of detainees, and maintaining trust and confidence in our justice system.\"\n\nAs Parliament gears up to deal with this escalating crisis, the wider public is calling for immediate transparency, accountability, and reform in the system.

    "The festive season has seen a surge in box office numbers, with the comedy sequel \"Little Fockers\" leading the pack. The film, which is the third installment in the \"Meet the Parents\" series, has topped the UK and Ireland box office chart over the Christmas period.\n\n\"Little Fockers\", starring Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro and Owen Wilson, raked in £3.1m between Boxing Day and New Year's Eve, according to film industry analysts. The film's success is a testament to the enduring popularity of the franchise, which began with \"Meet the Parents\" in 2000 and continued with \"Meet the Fockers\" in 2004.\n\nThe film's plot revolves around the comedic trials and tribulations of Greg Focker (Stiller) as he navigates the challenges of parenthood and dealing with his overbearing father-in-law, played by De Niro.

The Conservatives and Labour have both unveiled their fiscal strategies, sparking a fierce debate about the future of the UK economy.\n\nThe Conservative party has pledged to freeze income tax, VAT and national insurance contributions, arguing that this will help hard-working families and stimulate economic growth. They have also promised to increase public spending on health and education, while maintaining a commitment to fiscal prudence.\n\nLabour, on the other hand, has proposed a more radical approach, promising to increase taxes on the wealthiest in society and large corporations. They argue that this will generate additional revenue to fund public services and reduce inequality. However, critics have questioned whether these measures would deter investment and potentially damage the economy.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have also entered the fray, proposing a balanced approach that includes modest tax increases for high earners and additional spending on key public services. They argue that their plan is the most sustainable and fair, and would help to protect the economy while also improving public services.\n\nThe Green Party, meanwhile, has proposed the most radical changes, including a wealth tax, a financial transaction tax, and significant increases in public spending. They argue that these measures are necessary to address inequality and fund the transition to a green economy.\n\nThe SNP has focused its campaign on opposing austerity and advocating for increased public spending in Scotland. They argue that the other parties' plans do not go far enough in addressing the needs of the Scottish people.\n\nThe pre-poll clash on tax and spend has highlighted the stark choices facing voters in the upcoming election. While all parties agree on the need to invest in public services, there is significant disagreement about how to fund these investments and the potential impact on the economy.\n\nEconomists have warned that the UK's economic outlook is uncertain, with Brexit and global trade tensions posing significant risks. They argue that the next government will need to strike a careful balance between stimulating growth, maintaining fiscal discipline, and investing in public services.\n\nAs the election campaign enters its final weeks, the debate over tax and spend is set to intensify.

    "Campaigners pressurising the UK Government to extend the Border's railway link from Tweedbank to Carlisle have organised an enthusiastic public rally to accentuate their point. Their aim is to reconnect communities in the Scottish Borders with the rail network in England. \n\nThe event held at Galashiels Transport Interchange drew large crowds, many of whom support the extensive campaign labeled \"Destination Carlisle\". Veterans of the original Save the Border Rail Campaign were in attendance, who fought for the reinstatement of the Edinburgh-Tweedbank railway line that was officially reopened in 2015.\n\nThe Campaign for Borders Rail (CBR) is optimistic about the potential for socio-economic upliftment in the region with the inclusion of a direct rail link. The journey between the two cities, at about 58 miles, currently requires a car or bus. \n\nCBR spokesperson, Jess Granger, voiced her enthusiasm at the rally, stating \"It's a pleasure to see such a fantastic turnout at the rally. It underscores the passion and desire of the Borders community to see the rail link restored. This is more than just about transportation. It's about integration, growth, community development, and forging closer ties with our English neighbors.\"\n\nMoreover, David Parker, former leader of the Scottish Borders council and a long time campaigner stated, \"We need to keep the pressure on all levels of government to see this project realised. It's essential for strengthening the local economy through improved access to jobs and educational opportunities.\"\n\nAdditionally, the campaign has devised an online petition, garnering over 10,000 signatures thus far. Their efforts aim to convince the UK government of the lasting benefits that the rail link can offer.\n\nPolitics aside, the extension could be a crucial opportunity for Scotland and England to become more interconnected, creating a quicker, more sustainable method of transport between the regions.\n\n An economic impact study, conducted by the Scottish Border council into the proposed extension, expect its findings to be published later this year. This evidence could potentially boost the case for a new rail link, substantiating the socio-economic benefits the campaigners believe it will bring. \n\nTransport Scotland, the national transport agency, expressed that they are aware of the campaign and eagerly await the economic impact study's results. \n\nNonetheless, it is clear the Borders community is rallying together to achieve a common goal, and their united front will surely make it hard for their voices to be ignored.",
    "Returning to Europe’s top-tier football competition this year might still be a pipedream for Rangers FC, as their manager, Steven Gerrard, refuses to let high expectations get the better of the team's steady progress this season. \n\nThe Scottish Premiership leaders have been awarded plaudits for their remarkable domestic form this season, making waves and raising hopes for European qualification in the process. However, in a recent press conference, Gerrard made it clear that staying grounded remains the primary goal. \n\n“Our focus is on the Scottish Premiership, and ensuring we stay consistent through the season,” Gerrard stated. “Europe is definitely an aspiration; the dream for any club at this level. But to say we’re within reach is to overstate our situation.”\n\nThis caution shouldn't be misconstrued for a lack of ambition from the former Liverpool stalwart. Gerrard is acutely aware of the impact a European top-tier berth would have on the club and its fans, but he refuses to let this dilute their domestic focus. \n\n“We have worked very hard to instil a strong mentality within the squad, and complacency can undo much of that good work. As much as we are hopeful, and as much as we want it, we will not let aspirations for Europe distract us from our domestic duties,” Gerrard added.\n\nUnder Gerrard's guidance, Rangers have made significant strides. Their current league form is undeniably their best since their return to top flight football, but the manager is adamant that nothing should compromise their domestic stability. \n\nThe former England international concedes that every upturn in form naturally comes with heightened expectations, but he remains resolute in his methodical approach. “Our fans have been tremendous, and one of the most gratifying aspects of our current form has been seeing their excitement. But we owe it to them to maintain a realistic perspective. There’s still plenty of football to be played, both domestically and in Europe.\"\n\nIt's crystal clear that Gerrard is refusing to count his chickens before they hatch.

    "Mobile phones, the ubiquitous devices that have revolutionised communication, have now been in use for two decades, marking a significant milestone in the history of technology. \n\nThe first mobile phone call was made on 3rd April 1973, but it wasn't until the 1990s that mobile phones became widely available and affordable for the general public. Since then, they have evolved from bulky, expensive devices with limited functionality to sleek, powerful gadgets that are an integral part of our daily lives.\n\nOver the past 20 years, mobile phones have transformed the way we communicate, work, and entertain ourselves. They have made it possible to stay connected with people around the world, access information at our fingertips, and capture and share moments in real-time.\n\nThe evolution of mobile phones has been driven by advances in technology and changing consumer demands. The introduction of smartphones in the late 2000s marked a significant shift, turning mobile phones into multi-purpose devices that can be used for browsing the internet, sending emails, playing games, and much more.\n\nThe rise of mobile phones has also had a profound impact on various industries. For instance, they have disrupted the traditional media industry by enabling the rise of social media and streaming services. They have also transformed the retail industry by facilitating online shopping and mobile payments.\n\nDespite the numerous benefits, the widespread use of mobile phones has also raised concerns about privacy, security, and the impact on mental health. There are ongoing debates about the need for regulation to address these issues.\n\nAs mobile phones celebrate 20 years of use, it's clear that they have become an indispensable part of our lives. Looking ahead, it's exciting to imagine what the next 20 years might bring. With advancements in technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality, the future of mobile phones looks promising.\n\nIn the meantime, as we mark this milestone, it's worth reflecting on how far we've come and the incredible impact that these small devices have had on our lives. From the first call made on a brick-like device to the latest smartphone in our pocket, the journey of mobile phones over the past 20 years is truly remarkable.",
    "UK supermarket giant, Sainsbury's, has made a significant contribution to the Labour Party's election campaign, marking a notable shift in the political landscape. The donation, which is believed to be in the region of six figures, is one of the largest the party has received from a corporate entity in recent years.\n\nThe move is seen as a significant endorsement of the Labour Party's economic policies, which have been criticised by some business leaders for being too left-wing. However, Sainsbury's decision to back the party suggests that there is growing confidence in the business community about Labour's plans for the economy.\n\nA spokesperson for Sainsbury's confirmed the donation, stating: \"We believe in a fair and balanced economy and feel that the Labour Party's policies align with our own values. We are proud to support them in the upcoming election.\"\n\nThe Labour Party has welcomed the donation, with a spokesperson saying: \"This generous donation from Sainsbury's is a clear endorsement of our economic policies. It shows that businesses, both big and small, are beginning to recognise that a Labour government would be good for the economy.\"\n\nThe donation comes at a crucial time for the Labour Party, which has been struggling to match the Conservative Party's fundraising efforts. The Conservatives have traditionally enjoyed strong support from the business community, but this latest donation suggests that the tide may be turning.\n\nPolitical analysts suggest that Sainsbury's donation could encourage other businesses to follow suit. \"This is a significant moment,\" said Professor David Cutts, a political scientist at the University of Birmingham. \"If other businesses see that a company as big and respected as Sainsbury's is backing Labour, they might feel more confident about doing the same.\"\n\nHowever, the Conservatives have dismissed the significance of the donation. A party spokesperson said: \"We are confident that our policies are the ones that will deliver for businesses and for the economy. One donation does not change that.\"\n\nThe Labour Party will be hoping that Sainsbury's donation will give them a much-needed boost in the polls, as they seek to close the gap on the Conservatives ahead of the election.",
    "US car giants General Motors (GM) and Ford have announced significant cuts in production due to a sharp decline in sales, reflecting the ongoing impact of the global chip shortage and the pandemic on the auto industry.\n\nGeneral Motors, the largest US automaker, said it would reduce production at most of its North American plants for two weeks because of the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage. The company did not disclose how much volume it would lose or which suppliers were causing the largest issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford, the second-largest US automaker, also announced that it would temporarily halt production at its Kansas City assembly plant, which makes its best-selling F-150 pickup truck, due to the chip shortage. The company also said it would cut shifts at two more of its plants.\n\nThe global chip shortage has hit automakers particularly hard, causing delays in production and forcing some to temporarily close factories. The problem was exacerbated by a fire at a key chip plant in Japan and severe winter weather in Texas, where a large number of chipmakers have factories.\n\nThe production cuts come as both GM and Ford are grappling with a significant drop in sales. According to the latest data, GM's sales fell by 6.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year, while Ford's sales dropped by 14.1%.\n\nBoth companies have warned that the chip shortage and the production cuts will significantly impact their profits. GM said it could shave up to $2bn off its earnings this year, while Ford warned it could hit its profits by as much as $2.5bn.\n\nThe auto industry is a key part of the US economy, and the production cuts could have wider implications, potentially leading to job losses and a slowdown in economic recovery.\n\nThe chip shortage is expected to last into 2022, according to industry experts, adding to the challenges facing the auto industry as it tries to recover from the impact of the pandemic.",
    "Swiss cement giant, LafargeHolcim, has embarked on a significant acquisition spree, snapping up several companies in a bid to expand its global footprint. The move comes as the company seeks to capitalise on the booming construction industry and strengthen its position as a leading supplier of building materials.\n\nIn a series of deals announced over the past few weeks, LafargeHolcim has acquired a number of smaller firms across Europe, Asia, and North America. The acquisitions include a majority stake in a German cement company, a Chinese concrete firm, and a Canadian aggregates business.\n\nThe company's aggressive expansion strategy is seen as a response to the growing demand for construction materials, driven by a global surge in infrastructure projects and residential construction. The acquisitions are expected to significantly boost LafargeHolcim's production capacity and market share.\n\nCEO of LafargeHolcim, Jan Jenisch, said: \"These acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. They will allow us to better serve our customers by providing a wider range of products and services, and to expand our presence in key markets.\"\n\nThe Swiss firm's buying spree has been largely financed by its strong cash flow and robust balance sheet, which has been bolstered by a series of cost-cutting measures and efficiency improvements implemented over the past few years.\n\nHowever, the acquisitions have also raised concerns about potential anti-competitive behaviour. Some industry observers have warned that LafargeHolcim's growing dominance could lead to higher prices and less choice for consumers.\n\nIn response to these concerns, Jenisch said: \"We are committed to fair competition. We believe that our acquisitions will benefit customers by providing them with better products and services, and we will continue to work closely with regulators to ensure that our business practices are in line with competition laws.\"\n\nDespite these assurances, the company's acquisition spree is likely to face scrutiny from competition authorities in the countries where the acquired firms are based.\n\nLafargeHolcim is the world's largest cement manufacturer, with operations in more than 70 countries. The company was formed in 2015 through the merger of French firm Lafarge and Swiss company Holcim, and has since become a major player in the global construction industry.",
    "The UK's sport betting industry is under scrutiny as questions are raised about the current betting rules and regulations amid increasing concern over gambling addiction and related harm.\n\nThe Gambling Act 2005, which currently governs how betting, sports, bingo, casino games and lottery draws are run in the UK, is due for review, with increased focus on the sports betting arena. This review comes against a backdrop of mounting public concern about the effects of gambling on vulnerable individuals and communities.\n\nOne of the main areas for consideration is the role of advertising in local sports. Critics argue that relationships between sports teams and betting companies can encourage problem gambling. The integration of betting advertisements within sports broadcasts is also a contentious issue that will be addressed.\n\nOver the past decade, the betting landscape has dramatically shifted with the advent of online gambling. This uptick has seen a rise in cases of gambling addiction, prompting calls for tighter controls over online bookmakers and gambling companies. According to the Gambling Commission, 55,000 children aged 11 to 16 have a gambling problem, a figure that has quadrupled in the past two years.\n\nDuring the review, a prominent concern will be whether betting companies are doing enough to safeguard young people and limit their exposure to gambling advertisements. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will scrutinise existing legislation to ensure it is fit for the digital age.\n\nSome stakeholders have called for a complete overhaul of the sports betting rules. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Gambling Related Harm has suggested drastic measures such as a blanket ban on gambling advertising and setting limits on betting.\n\nMany soccer teams in the UK count betting firms among their main sponsors, who they rely on for significant financial support. Therefore, any rule changes could have considerable implications for these teams, sparking intense debate among stakeholders in both the sports and betting worlds.\n\nAt the same time, sport betting providers argue that current regulations are sufficient and it is the enforcement that needs to be toughened up.\n\nLegislators, health bodies, and sporting organisations have acknowledged that a balance must be struck between the economic benefits brought by the gambling industry and the need to protect the most vulnerable from harm.\n\nThe government review into the Gambling Act 2005, spearheaded by the DCMS alongside the Advisory Board for Safer Gambling, is expected to publish its findings and recommendations by the end of the year.\n\nWhile the outcome of this spotlight on sports betting rules remains uncertain, it is clear that this is a pivotal moment for the future of the UK’s sport betting industry.

    "Former Chelsea and Arsenal defender, William Gallas, has predicted that the Premier League race this season is likely to come down to two teams - Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nThe experienced Frenchman, who played for Chelsea and Arsenal between 2001 and 2010, stated this during his recent interview with a popular sports channel. He believes that the superiority of these two teams in recent seasons, coupled with their formidable squads, positions them as front runners for the 2021-2022 Premier League title.\n\nGallas, who won two Premier League titles during his time at Chelsea, said: \"I believe this season will be between City and Liverpool. They have been very strong for the last few years, and I think they will be again this year. They have the best squads and the best managers, so for me, it's between those two.\"\n\nManchester City, managed by Pep Guardiola, won the domestic title last season, finishing 12 points clear at the top of the table, while Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool side were the champions in the 2019-2020 season.\n\nThe comments from Gallas set up an exciting narrative for the new season, adding more fuel to the already blazing competition. However, he did not completely rule out other contenders, specifically mentioning his former club Chelsea under the leadership of Thomas Tuchel, and Manchester United with their new signing, Jadon Sancho.\n\n\"Of course, you cannot discount Chelsea or Manchester United. They have been signing some very good players. Chelsea have a good coach in Tuchel, and Man Utd have now added Sancho. They will be dangerous, definitely, but I still see City and Liverpool as the main contenders,\" Gallas added.\n\nThe Premier League season kicked off on August 13, with the intensity and competition set to ratchet up over the coming months. Fans worldwide will be keen to see if Gallas' prediction comes true or if there's a surprise waiting down the line.\n",
    "Former Liverpool manager, Rafael Benitez, has issued a stern warning to Steven Gerrard, as the latter prepares to take over the reins at Aston Villa. Benitez, who managed Gerrard during his successful stint at Liverpool, has cautioned the former England captain about the challenges of Premier League management.\n\nGerrard, who recently left his role as Rangers manager to take up the Aston Villa job, is set to embark on his first managerial stint in the Premier League. Benitez, currently managing Everton, has offered some words of advice to his former player.\n\n\"Managing in the Premier League is a different ball game,\" Benitez said. \"The pressure, the expectations, and the level of competition are all much higher. Steven has done a fantastic job at Rangers, but he must be prepared for a different kind of challenge at Aston Villa.\"\n\nBenitez, who won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005 with Gerrard as his captain, also highlighted the importance of having a good support system in place. \"It's crucial to have a strong team around you. You need people who understand the game, who can offer advice and support when things get tough,\" he added.\n\nThe Spanish manager also warned Gerrard about the high expectations that come with managing a Premier League club. \"Aston Villa is a big club with a rich history. The fans will expect results and performances. Steven must be ready to deliver on those expectations,\" Benitez said.\n\nGerrard, who won the Scottish Premiership title with Rangers last season, will be hoping to replicate his success in England. However, with Benitez's warning, it's clear that the former Liverpool captain has a tough task ahead.\n\nBenitez concluded his advice by wishing Gerrard well in his new role. \"I wish Steven all the best at Aston Villa. He was a fantastic player and has shown he can be a great manager. I'm sure he'll do well, but he must be prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.\"\n\nGerrard's first game in charge of Aston Villa will be against Brighton on November 20th. It remains to be seen how he will fare in the Premier League, but with advice from seasoned managers like Benitez, Gerrard will surely be better prepared for the task ahead.",
    "Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has praised the agreement reached to initiate talks between Turkey and the European Union (EU), describing it as a \"historic moment\". \n\nMr Blair, who has been a long-standing advocate for Turkey's EU membership, said the decision to start negotiations was a \"huge achievement\" and a \"win-win\" for both sides. He added that Turkey's accession to the EU would be a \"powerful symbol\" of the union's commitment to diversity and inclusivity.\n\nThe decision to start talks was reached after intense negotiations, with Austria dropping its objections after the EU agreed to include a reference to \"privileged partnership\" as an alternative to full membership. The talks are expected to last for at least a decade and will cover a wide range of issues, including human rights, economic reforms and Cyprus.\n\nMr Blair said: \"This is a historic moment for Turkey and for Europe. It shows that the EU is a truly inclusive organisation, open to all countries that share its values and are willing to abide by its rules.\"\n\nHe added: \"Turkey's accession would be a powerful symbol of the EU's commitment to diversity and inclusivity. It would show that the EU is not a Christian club, but a union of nations committed to democracy, human rights and the rule of law.\"\n\nThe former Prime Minister also highlighted the economic benefits of Turkey's membership, saying it would create new opportunities for trade and investment. He said: \"Turkey is a dynamic, fast-growing economy. Its membership would bring new energy and vitality to the EU.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Blair acknowledged that the negotiations would be \"long and difficult\", and that Turkey would need to make \"significant reforms\" to meet the EU's membership criteria. He said: \"This is the start of a long journey. But I am confident that Turkey is ready to take on this challenge.\"\n\nThe decision to start talks with Turkey has been controversial, with some EU member states expressing concerns about the country's human rights record, its treatment of the Kurdish minority, and its refusal to recognise Cyprus, an EU member state. However, Mr Blair said these issues would be addressed during the negotiations.\n\nHe concluded: \"This is a historic opportunity for Turkey and for Europe. We should seize it with both hands.\"",
    "The UK property market is experiencing a slowdown, according to a recent survey conducted by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). The survey, which included responses from estate agents and surveyors across the country, revealed a significant drop in the number of people looking to buy a home and a decrease in property prices.\n\nRICS reported that the net balance of surveyors seeing a rise in buyer enquiries fell to -15% in August, down from -7% in July. This is the lowest level since May 2020, when the country was in the midst of the first national lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe survey also found that the net balance of surveyors reporting house price increases fell to +46% in August, down from +52% in July. This indicates a slowdown in the rate of house price growth, although prices are still rising overall.\n\nRICS attributed the slowdown to a combination of factors, including the end of the stamp duty holiday and the ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. The institution also noted that the supply of properties for sale remains limited, which could be contributing to the slowdown in buyer activity.\n\n\"The market is starting to lose some steam with both demand from potential buyers and sales starting to slip back,\" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS Chief Economist. \"However, with the supply of properties for sale remaining tight, it's likely that prices will continue to rise in the short term.\"\n\nThe survey's findings are in line with other recent reports suggesting a slowdown in the UK property market. Last month, the Nationwide Building Society reported that house price growth had slowed to its lowest level in six months, while the Bank of England reported a drop in mortgage approvals.\n\nDespite the slowdown, RICS noted that surveyors remain relatively optimistic about the market's prospects over the next 12 months. The net balance of surveyors expecting house prices to rise over the next year stood at +30% in August, down slightly from +33% in July.\n\nHowever, Rubinsohn warned that the market could face further challenges in the coming months, particularly if the economic impact of the pandemic worsens. \"The big question is what happens next,\" he said. \"With the furlough scheme coming to an end and job uncertainty rising, the outlook for the housing market is very much up in the air.\"",
    "Former England Under-21 boss Stuart Pearce has expressed strong interest in succeeding Kevin Keegan as the permanent manager of Newcastle United. Keegan stepped down from the coveted position earlier this month due to disagreements with the club's hierarchy over player signings. Pearce, who guided the England Under-21 team to the final of the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, said he is ready for a new challenge in his career.\n\nPearce spent two years as manager of Manchester City before being sacked in 2007. Since then, he has gained significant experience working with young players as the head coach of England Under-21s. During that time, he successfully led the team to the Under-21 European Championships final in 2009 and semi-finals in 2007.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Pearce said, \"I've always maintained that my future lies in club management and the vacancy at Newcastle United represents a fantastic opportunity. It's a club with great tradition, passionate fans and a talented squad of players.\"\n\nHe expressed his admiration for Keegan, saying, \"Kevin did an incredible job whilst in charge of Newcastle, however the game moves on and now the focus is to build on his legacy.\" \n\nReacting to the news, former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer said, \"Stuart is a determined, ambitious coach with a strong mentality. I believe he could be the right leader for Newcastle at this critical time.\"\n\nPearce's interest in the role comes as Newcastle United has already began the search for a new manager, a process they admit might not be swift. Names such as former Lyon boss Bruno Genesio and ex-Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger have also been mooted as potential candidates for the role.\n\nNewcastle United are currently 14th in the Premier League, having won only one of their first four games of the season. Pearce, if appointed, would be tasked with improving the team's performances and hauling them up the table.\n\nEarlier this year, Pearce expressed his desire to go back into full-time management after enjoying his time in coaching duties with the England national team.\n\nNo official comment from Newcastle United regarding Pearce's statement has been made public yet.",
    "Former Liverpool and Leeds United winger, Harry Kewell, remains sideline amidst long-standing injury concerns. The Australian football legend's return to the field continues being delayed, casting a shadow over his highly anticipated comeback.\n\nKewell, now 39, who also had a distinguished international career with the Socceroos, has been suffering from a gruelling lingering injury, the nature of which hasn't been disclosed. His long-awaited return to the field has now been put on hold indefinitely.\n\nThe stalwart, who was at the peak of his career in the early 2000s, has been diligently working on his recovery, undergoing rigorous rehabilitation programmes. However, despite his disciplined efforts, his injury is taking longer than expected to heal, leaving fans and followers in continued suspense.\n\nKewell's spokesperson earlier spoke with the press, stating, \"Harry is understandably disappointed with the delay. He's, however, committed to returning to the field in pristine condition and won't rush his recovery process risking further complications.\"\n\nThe Australian's last competitive match came for Melbourne Heart, where he retired in 2014. Last year, he had hinted at making a surprise return to action, generating widespread enthusiasm amongst his followers. The current setback, however, has resulted in dampened spirits for those hoping to see the ex-Galatasaray player back in action.\n\nMedical experts suggest the type of injury Kewell has suffered usually requires a momentous healing period, and a rush to return could potentially lead to long-term problems. Meanwhile, Kewell's unwavering commitment to his recovery and his passion for football remains his driving force.\n\nThe delay in Kewell's return has sparked a conversation in the sport’s industry about player's health, safety protocols, and the demanding nature of professional football. It is a potent reminder of the physical demands intrinsic to this globally followed sport.\n\nIn the meantime, fans and followers worldwide wait with bated breath for further updates about Kewell's recovery.

    "British MP George Galloway has issued an urgent plea calling for the release of a UK citizen taken captive in the Middle East. The statement comes amid increasing fears for the hostage’s safety. \n\nIn his appeal, the veteran MP said he was “deeply concerned” about the individual, whose identity is being protected for security reasons. While no specific group has claimed responsibility for the abduction, it is widely believed that the hostage is in the hands of a militant group operating in the region.\n\n\"The kidnap and detention of innocent civilians is a flagrant violation of international law. It is an act of barbarity that undermines efforts to bring peace and stability to this troubled region,\" said Mr. Galloway. \"We urge those holding the hostage to release him immediately, unconditionally, and safely.\"\n\nThe plight of the kidnapped individual, reportedly an aid worker, has been shrouded in secrecy due to fears that publicity could put him at further risk. It is understood that the UK Foreign Office is working behind the scenes, alongside international partners, to secure his release. \n\nAs a long-standing critic of Western involvement in the Middle East, George Galloway has previously used his influence to call for the protection of civilians caught in conflict zones. His plea adds to a chorus of voices globally calling for the swift and safe return of the kidnapped aid worker.\n\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office has confirmed the kidnapping, but declined to give details, citing the need for discretion in its efforts to ensure the hostage's safe return. Its only advice to the public and media at this juncture is to respect the privacy of the individual’s family and refrain from speculative reporting.\n\n\"There is absolutely no justification for any group or individual to use kidnap and the threat of violence on innocent people. We are doing all we can, in close cooperation with our international partners, to secure their safe and swift release,\" said the Foreign Office in a statement.\n\nIn the UK, vigils have been held across different parts of the country in solidarity with the imprisoned aid worker, amplifying the plea for his immediate release.\n",

    "Brazil’s unemployment has hit a record low, sparking optimism about the robustness of the nation's expanding labour market. The jobless rate has plunged to 11.8%, down from 12.4% a month earlier, marking the lowest figure recorded by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) since the study began in 2012.\n\nBrazil, known as one of the biggest economies in Latin America, has been dealing with economic difficulties in recent years. However, with the new jobless rate, economists are predicting a turnaround. They note that the fall was driven by increases in both formal and informal employment - a positive sign of economic growth and stability.\n\nNewly released data show about 12.5 million people were unemployed in June, down from 13.1 million in May. Moreover, Brazil's workforce has continued to rise, now reaching roughly 105.9 million people. \n\nHowever, this set of data does not necessarily reflect an entirely rosy picture. While the fall in the unemployment rate is a welcome development, the increase in informal jobs—referring to roles that lack employment contracts or social benefits, usually with lower wages—is also a matter of concern. Approximately 40% of Brazilians work in such conditions.\n\nEconomists have also pointed out that the drop in unemployment is partly due to seasonal influences. A temporary increase in jobs, particularly in the service and retail sectors, is common in the second half of the year.\n\n\"We are witnessing an economy on the recovery path from the severe recession between 2015-2016\", says Ricardo Amorim, a renowned Brazilian economist. \"However, it is crucial that structural reforms continue so that these numbers do not prove to be ephemeral and make irrefutable the improvement in the living standards of Brazilians.\"\n\nWhile job creation is clearly moving in a positive direction, the country's economic policymakers must strive to ensure stable economic growth to truly slash unemployment rates and provide decent, contracted work for the populace.\n\nThe government, under President Jair Bolsonaro, has pledged to accelerate economic growth through deregulation, tax reduction, and the execution of a wide-ranging pension reform. However, these actions still have to translate into tangible benefits for the labour market.\n\nWith Brazil's economy still on shaky ground, this dip in unemployment comes as a sliver of positive news. Whether this promising trend will continue, remains to be seen.",
    "Russian state-owned company Rosneft has acquired a unit of the now-defunct oil giant Yukos for $9bn at an auction. The sale is part of the Russian government's ongoing effort to dismantle Yukos and sell off its assets.\n\nThe unit, Yuganskneftegas, was Yukos' main oil-producing subsidiary, accounting for about 60% of the company's oil output. It was put up for auction to help pay off Yukos' massive tax debts, which the Russian authorities claim amount to $27.5bn.\n\nRosneft, which is majority-owned by the Russian government, was the only bidder in the auction. The starting price for the unit was set at $8.65bn, and Rosneft's winning bid was only slightly higher, at $9.35bn.\n\nThe sale of Yuganskneftegas is the latest development in the long-running saga of Yukos, once Russia's largest oil company. Its former CEO, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested in 2003 on charges of tax evasion and fraud, which he claims were politically motivated.\n\nThe Russian government began dismantling Yukos in 2004, seizing its assets and selling them off to state-owned companies. This has been widely seen as part of President Vladimir Putin's strategy to increase state control over Russia's oil and gas industry.\n\nThe auction of Yuganskneftegas has been controversial, with critics arguing that the sale was rigged in favour of Rosneft. Yukos' management has also claimed that the auction was illegal and has vowed to challenge it in court.\n\nHowever, the Russian authorities have defended the auction, saying it was necessary to recover the huge tax debts owed by Yukos. They have also dismissed claims that the sale was politically motivated, arguing that it was simply a matter of enforcing the law.\n\nThe acquisition of Yuganskneftegas will significantly boost Rosneft's oil production capacity, making it one of the largest oil companies in Russia. It will also further consolidate the Russian government's control over the country's oil industry.",

Smartphones, once a luxury, have now become a necessity, evolving into a hub of futuristic technology that is transforming our lives in ways we could never have imagined.\n\nThe smartphone industry is continuously innovating, with tech giants like Apple, Samsung, and Google pushing the boundaries of what these pocket-sized devices can do. From augmented reality to artificial intelligence, the future of technology is not in some far-off sci-fi world; it's right here in our hands.\n\nAugmented Reality (AR) is one of the most exciting advancements in smartphone technology. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, providing users with an immersive experience that seamlessly blends reality with the digital world. Apps like Pokemon Go and Snapchat have popularised AR, but its potential extends far beyond gaming and social media. For instance, IKEA's AR app allows customers to virtually place furniture in their homes before making a purchase, revolutionising the shopping experience.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is another groundbreaking technology that is becoming increasingly integrated into our smartphones.

    "Former world number one, Marat Safin, suffered a surprising defeat at the Dubai Tennis Championships, adding another setback to his already struggling season. The Russian tennis star was ousted in the first round by an unseeded player, marking a disappointing start to his campaign in the Middle East.\n\nSafin, who was once considered one of the most formidable players on the circuit, has been struggling to regain his form after a series of injuries and inconsistent performances. His loss in Dubai is a stark reminder of the challenges he faces in his quest to return to the top of the game.\n\nThe two-time Grand Slam winner was visibly frustrated throughout the match, struggling to find his rhythm against his lower-ranked opponent. Despite showing flashes of his former brilliance, Safin was unable to maintain his momentum, eventually succumbing to a straight-sets defeat.\n\nThe shock loss is a significant blow to Safin's confidence, who had hoped to use the Dubai Championships as a springboard to kickstart his season.

    "Iran's government has proposed a budget that aims to raise billions of dollars through the privatisation of state-owned assets. The move is seen as a response to crippling sanctions and the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe budget proposal, presented to parliament by President Ebrahim Raisi, seeks to generate around $3.4bn through the sale of state-owned companies and properties. The plan is part of a broader strategy to reduce the country's dependence on oil revenues and to cope with the economic challenges posed by US sanctions and the global pandemic.\n\nThe proposed budget for the next Iranian year, starting on 21 March, is around 17,630 trillion rials ($67bn at the free market exchange rate), a 40% increase compared to the current year's budget. However, the budget is based on an oil price of $65 a barrel, which is significantly higher than the current price.\n\nThe privatisation plan includes the sale of shares in some of the country's largest companies, including those in the oil, gas, petrochemical, mining, and telecommunications sectors. The government also plans to sell properties and other assets.\n\nThe move has been met with criticism from some quarters, with opponents arguing that it could lead to job losses and increased inequality. However, the government insists that the privatisation will lead to greater efficiency and competitiveness in the economy.\n\nThe budget proposal also includes measures to increase tax revenues and reduce government expenditure. It aims to cut public sector salaries and pensions, while increasing taxes on goods and services.\n\nThe budget still needs to be approved by parliament and the Guardian Council, a body that vets all legislation. It is expected to face opposition from some lawmakers who are concerned about the impact of the privatisation on the economy and on the livelihoods of ordinary Iranians.\n\nThe proposed budget comes at a time when Iran's economy is under severe strain. The country has been hit hard by US sanctions, which were reimposed in 2018 after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal. The sanctions have cut off Iran's access to international financial markets and have led to a sharp fall in oil exports, the country's main source of revenue.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the economic crisis, with a sharp drop in oil demand and a slowdown in economic activity. The government has struggled to provide adequate support to businesses and households affected by the pandemic, leading to widespread discontent and protests.\n\nThe proposed privatisation is seen as a desperate move by the government to raise funds and to stimulate the economy. However, it remains to",
    "The Liberal Democrats have unveiled plans to support first-time home buyers in their manifesto for the upcoming general elections in the UK. The proposals would seek to make it easier for young individuals and families to purchase their first home.\n\nThe Lib Dems' plan for first-time buyers includes the introduction of 'Rent to Own' homes. Under this scheme, new homes would be made available to first-time buyers to rent at market rates, with the option to purchase a part of the property each year. After 30 years, those in the scheme would become full owners of the property.\n\nFurthermore, the party’s proposal highlights a 'Help to Rent' scheme designed to support young people saving for a deposit. This would involve government-backed tenancy deposit loans for all first-time renters under 30, providing affordability and convenience to those struggling to accumulate enough funds for a deposit.\n\nJo Swinson, leader of the Lib Dems, speaks passionately about the proposal. \"Our revolutionary Rent to Own scheme would greatly help younger people who have not been able to get a foot on the housing ladder,\" she stated. \"We will ensure they have the chance to buy their own homes while renting.\"\n\nCritics, however, have questioned the feasibility of the rent-to-own scheme, stating that it could lead to increased house prices and unaffordability. Some also fear it might put added pressure on the already strained housing market.\n\nHowever, Ms. Swinson is confident that the party’s plans will work well. \"The policy will create a whole new generation of home-owners, empowering young people to take charge of their future and own their own homes,\" she stated.\n\nIn addition to the 'Rent to Own' and 'Help to Rent' plans, the Lib Dems also aim to build 300,000 properties per year by 2024, including 100,000 units of social housing. The party also advocates for renting rights such as longer-term tenancies, banning letting fees for tenants, and capping upfront deposits.\n\nThe proposals serve as a part of the broader Lib Dem strategy to alleviate the housing crisis in the UK and provide homes for all. However, the success of these bold policies will depend on the party’s performance in the imminent general elections.",
    "European Union (EU) ministers are set to consider a proposal to impose a tax on jet fuel in an effort to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, a sector that currently accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe proposal, which will be discussed at a meeting of EU finance ministers, is part of a broader effort to meet the bloc's ambitious climate goals, which include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.\n\nCurrently, jet fuel for international flights is exempt from taxes under an international agreement dating back to the 1940s. However, the EU has the power to tax fuel for flights within the bloc, a move that could significantly increase the cost of air travel.\n\nThe proposal has been met with resistance from the aviation industry, which argues that a tax on jet fuel would increase costs for airlines and passengers, potentially damaging the sector's recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, environmental groups have welcomed the proposal, arguing that the aviation sector needs to do more to reduce its carbon emissions. They argue that a tax on jet fuel would encourage airlines to invest in cleaner technologies and more fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\nThe proposal is likely to face a tough battle to win approval from all 27 EU member states, some of which have significant aviation industries. Any decision to impose a tax on jet fuel would need to be agreed unanimously by all EU countries.\n\nThe EU has been stepping up its efforts to combat climate change in recent years, with measures including a carbon pricing system for industries and plans to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035.\n\nThe proposal to tax jet fuel comes as the bloc is also considering a separate plan to include the aviation sector in its carbon pricing system, which would force airlines to buy permits for the carbon dioxide they emit.\n\nThe discussions on a jet fuel tax are part of a wider debate in the EU about how to finance the bloc's transition to a low-carbon economy. Other proposals under consideration include a levy on digital services and a tax on financial transactions.",
    "The official website of former US President George W. Bush has been temporarily blocked following a cyber attack. The incident has raised concerns about the security of information related to the former president and his administration.\n\nThe website, which contains archives of speeches, press releases, and other official documents from Bush's presidency, was targeted by unidentified hackers. The nature of the attack and the extent of the damage are currently under investigation.\n\nA spokesperson for the former president confirmed the incident, stating, \"We are aware of the issue and are working to resolve it. We have taken the necessary steps to protect the site and its contents.\"\n\nThe attack comes at a time when cyber security has become a major concern for governments and corporations worldwide. It also highlights the potential vulnerability of websites associated with high-profile individuals and institutions.\n\nWhile the motive behind the attack remains unclear, experts suggest it could range from a simple act of vandalism to a more sophisticated attempt to access sensitive information. \n\nThe Bush website is not the first to be targeted. In recent years, several websites associated with US politicians have been attacked. This includes the campaign websites of both 2020 presidential candidates, which faced numerous cyber threats.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have been alerted about the incident. Both agencies have been actively involved in efforts to improve the nation's cyber defenses.\n\nThe attack on the Bush website underscores the need for robust cyber security measures, not just for government institutions, but also for individuals and organizations in the public eye.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the website remains offline to ensure the integrity of its contents and the security of its systems. It is unclear when the site will be restored, but officials assure that every effort is being made to bring it back online as soon as possible.\n\nThe former president's office has urged the public to be patient and understanding, emphasizing that the safety and security of the website's information is their top priority.",
    "Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has dismissed calls to heed advice regarding the situation in Iraq, stating that he stands by his decisions made during his time in office. This comes amid growing criticism of his handling of the Iraq War and its aftermath.\n\nMr Blair, who led the UK into the Iraq War in 2003, has been under increasing pressure to respond to claims that he ignored expert advice on the potential consequences of the conflict. Critics argue that his decisions have contributed to the current instability in the Middle East.\n\nHowever, in a defiant interview, Mr Blair stated, \"I made the decisions I thought were right at the time, based on the information I had. I stand by those decisions.\" He further added that he believes it is \"unfair\" to link the current situation in Iraq to decisions made over a decade ago.\n\nThe former Prime Minister also rejected the notion that he should have listened more to military and diplomatic experts. \"I listened to a wide range of advice and ultimately, as Prime Minister, I had to make the final decision. I accept responsibility for those decisions, but I will not accept the premise that they were wrong,\" he said.\n\nMr Blair's comments have sparked a fresh wave of controversy, with critics accusing him of refusing to acknowledge any mistakes in his handling of the Iraq War. Some have called for a new inquiry into the war and its aftermath, arguing that lessons must be learned to prevent similar situations in the future.\n\nHowever, supporters of Mr Blair argue that he acted in what he believed were the best interests of the UK and the wider world, and that the situation in Iraq would have been far worse under Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\nThe debate over the Iraq War and its legacy continues to divide opinion, both in the UK and internationally. As the situation in Iraq remains unstable, the decisions made by Mr Blair and his government continue to be scrutinised and debated.",
    "Danish winger Jesper Gronkjaer has agreed to a transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid, ending his stint with English club Chelsea. The move is expected to bolster Madrid's attacking options as they aim to reclaim the La Liga title.\n\nGronkjaer, 28, has been a key player for Chelsea since joining the club in 2000. His pace and crossing ability have made him a constant threat on the wings, contributing significantly to Chelsea's success in recent seasons. However, the opportunity to play for one of the world's most prestigious clubs proved too enticing for the Danish international.\n\nReal Madrid have been keen to strengthen their squad following a disappointing season, which saw them finish fourth in La Liga. The acquisition of Gronkjaer is seen as a significant step towards achieving this goal. His experience and skill set are expected to complement the team's existing attacking talents, including Brazilian superstar Ronaldo and French maestro Zinedine Zidane.\n\nReal Madrid's sporting director, Jorge Valdano, expressed his delight at securing Gronkjaer's services. \"Jesper is a world-class player who will add a new dimension to our attack,\" he said. \"His speed, skill and experience will be invaluable as we aim to challenge for the title next season.\"\n\nGronkjaer's move to Madrid is subject to a medical, which is expected to take place later this week. If all goes well, he will join his new teammates for pre-season training in July.\n\nThe transfer fee has not been disclosed, but it is believed to be in the region of £15 million. This would make Gronkjaer one of the most expensive Danish players in history, surpassing the £13 million Liverpool paid for Daniel Agger in 2006.\n\nGronkjaer's departure will be a blow for Chelsea, who will now need to find a replacement for their influential winger. However, with a wealth of talent at their disposal and a substantial transfer budget, the Blues are expected to move quickly to fill the void left by the Dane's departure.",
    "Ringtones sellers are to face stringent new regulations in an effort to clamp down on unscrupulous practices and protect consumers, under new rules announced by the UK telecoms regulator. The move follows a significant rise in complaints from mobile phone users about excessive costs and hidden charges.\n\nThe Ofcom regulator has said that the new rules will strongly regulate the ringtone industry, which had previously operated with relative freedom. This follows an alarming increase in the number of complaints arising from misleading advertisements, unclear subscription terms and inflated costs. \n\nIn many cases, users reported being lured into expensive monthly subscriptions for ringtones without their explicit agreement or understanding of the terms. Several phone users also claimed to have been billed for ringtones and other mobile services that were never used or delivered.\n\nTo tackle this, Ofcom is set to introduce a number of stringent rules aimed at making sure consumers are not hoodwinked by unscrupulous companies or complex terms and conditions. The regulator’s new guidelines stipulate that pricing information for any ringtone service must be clearly provided to the user at the point of purchase. In addition, firms will need to take steps to ensure that customers are fully aware they have entered into a recurring payment situation.\n\nUnder the new rules, advertising and marketing communications from these companies must also be honest and transparent. They should not mislead the consumers or omit important information about the cost of the service or the duration of the contract. \n\nA new rule that may give further relief to the customers is the 'cooling-off' period. Companies will now be required to offer a minimum 14-day 'cooling-off' period during which customers can cancel their purchase without being charged. \n\nIn a statement, Ofcom said that the protection of consumers is a priority. “We will fully investigate complaints and take robust action where necessary,\" a spokesperson added. The regulations will come into effect two months from now.\n\nThis move by Ofcom is viewed as a welcome step towards greater transparency in how digital services are offered and sold, putting an end to misleading practices that have left many consumers out of pocket over the years in the UK. \n\nWhile this new regulation is shaking up the ringtone industry, it is expected that other mobile and tech-related sectors might also come under similar scrutiny in near future. This could result in wider transparency and better protection for mobile users in the UK.",
    "Unilever, the multinational consumer goods giant, is set to undergo a significant shake-up as it grapples with a slip in profits. The company, which owns brands such as Dove, Ben & Jerry's, and Lipton, has seen a decline in its financial performance, prompting a strategic review of its operations.\n\nThe company's latest financial report revealed a 5% drop in underlying operating profit to €9.4bn (£8.1bn) for the year 2021. This comes despite a 3.5% increase in turnover to €51bn (£43.8bn). The company attributed the profit slip to increased costs of raw materials and logistics, exacerbated by the global supply chain disruptions.\n\nIn response to the disappointing results, Unilever's CEO, Alan Jope, announced a series of measures aimed at improving the company's financial performance. These include a comprehensive review of its business portfolio, cost-cutting initiatives, and a renewed focus on high-growth segments.\n\n\"We are not satisfied with our performance and are determined to improve our competitiveness and profitability,\" Jope said in a statement. \"We are taking decisive action to simplify our business, drive efficiency, and accelerate growth in high-potential areas.\"\n\nAs part of the shake-up, Unilever will be reviewing its tea business, which includes brands such as PG Tips and Lipton. The company had previously announced plans to separate this division, but the process has been delayed due to the pandemic. The review will also extend to other underperforming segments of the business.\n\nThe cost-cutting measures are expected to result in job losses, although the company has not yet provided specific details. Unilever has also pledged to increase its investment in digital marketing and e-commerce, areas that have seen significant growth during the pandemic.\n\nThe announcement of the shake-up has been met with mixed reactions from investors. While some have welcomed the decisive action, others have expressed concern about the potential impact on the company's workforce and the broader implications for the consumer goods sector.\n\nUnilever's share price fell by 2.5% in early trading following the announcement, reflecting investor uncertainty about the company's future direction.\n\nThe shake-up at Unilever comes at a time of significant challenges for the consumer goods sector, with companies grappling with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and changing consumer habits. It remains to be seen how successful Unilever's measures will be in reversing its profit slip and positioning the company for future growth.",

He said, \"People don't know the years, the time, the dedication it takes to succeed in this business. I am truly humbled to be here.\"\n\nThe Canadian-born actor began his thumping Hollywood career in the 1980s, moving from successfully doing commercials and small TV roles to becoming one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors by the 2000s.\n\nDespite facing personal and professional ups and downs, Reeves remains one of the most beloved and revered figures in Hollywood due to his unchanging humility and generosity.\n\nLuminaries who were present to honour Reeves included his co-stars from \"Cloud Atlas,\" Halle Berry and Ian McShane.

    "Shares in music giant EMI have taken a hit following a profit warning issued by the company. The warning, which predicted lower than expected profits for the year, has led to a significant drop in the company's share price.\n\nEMI, home to artists such as Coldplay and Katy Perry, saw its shares fall by 16% in early trading, wiping off nearly £200m from its market value. The company blamed the profit warning on poor sales in North America and a delay in the release of several key albums.\n\nThe music giant now expects its profits for the year to be \"significantly below\" previous forecasts. This is the second profit warning issued by the company in less than six months, which has raised concerns among investors about the company's financial health.\n\nAnalysts have suggested that the profit warning could make EMI more vulnerable to a takeover. The company has been the subject of takeover speculation in recent months, with several potential buyers reportedly interested.\n\nEMI's chief executive, Eric Nicoli, said the company was \"disappointed\" with the profit warning but remained \"confident in the strength of our music portfolio\". He added that the company was taking \"decisive action\" to address its issues in North America.\n\nThe profit warning comes at a challenging time for the music industry, which has been grappling with declining CD sales and the rise of digital music. EMI has been trying to adapt to these changes, investing heavily in digital music and signing deals with online music platforms.\n\nHowever, the company's efforts have so far failed to offset the decline in physical sales, leading to lower than expected revenues. The delay in the release of several key albums, including new records from Norah Jones and Gorillaz, has also impacted the company's earnings.\n\nThe profit warning is a blow to EMI, which has been struggling to compete with rivals such as Universal Music and Sony Music. The company will now be under pressure to reassure investors about its future prospects and to demonstrate that it can adapt to the changing music landscape.",
    "The UK government has announced a ban on forced retirement before the age of 65, in a move hailed as a significant step towards ending age discrimination in the workplace. The new legislation, which comes into effect immediately, will make it illegal for companies to compel employees to retire before they reach 65, unless it can be objectively justified.\n\nThe decision follows a series of high-profile legal cases in which employees challenged their employers over enforced retirement. The government has said that the new law will provide greater job security for older workers and allow them to contribute to the economy for longer.\n\nThe Minister for Pensions and Ageing Society, said: \"Forcing people to retire before they are ready is not only unfair, but it also deprives the economy of valuable skills and experience. This new law will ensure that people have the choice to continue working and contributing to the economy.\"\n\nThe move has been welcomed by age equality campaigners, who argue that the previous rules were discriminatory and out of touch with modern working practices. The charity Age UK described the ban as a \"major victory\" for older workers.\n\nHowever, some business groups have expressed concerns about the change. They argue that it could lead to increased costs for companies, particularly small businesses, and make workforce planning more difficult.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it recognised the benefits of a diverse workforce but warned that the ban could have unintended consequences. \"Businesses need to have the flexibility to manage their workforce and this includes being able to plan for the future,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nUnder the new law, employers will still be able to include a retirement age in contracts, but they will have to be able to objectively justify it. This could include jobs that require certain physical abilities or high levels of mental agility.\n\nThe ban on forced retirement under 65 is part of a wider government strategy to respond to the changing demographics of the UK workforce. With people living and staying healthy for longer, and with a rising state pension age, the government believes it is essential to remove barriers to older people working.\n\nThe government has also pledged to review the new law in five years' time to ensure it is working effectively and to make any necessary adjustments.",
    "In a world where digital technology is rapidly evolving, recently, mobile phones have become an almost indispensable part of our daily lives. Consequently, with companies like Apple and Samsung releasing new models every year, the number of outdated, unused phones cluttering our homes is on the rise. This not only contributes to pollution but also results in valuable resources being wasted. But what if these old phones could be given a new life?\n\nCompanies across the globe are now finding innovative ways to repurpose these old mobile phones, ensuring that they do not end up in landfills. From transforming them into educational tools to using them as components in new products, the business of \"upcycling\" old phones is steadily growing, providing a solution to the mounting issue of electronic waste.\n\nIn the UK alone, it is estimated that there are about 40 million unused phones gathering dust in drawers. They contain precious elements such as gold, silver, copper, platinum and palladium, which can be extracted and reused, making a significant impact on reducing mining and its associated environmental damage.\n\nA London-based start-up, Giffgaff, is playing a pivotal role in the phone recycle scheme. The company's recent initiative encourages people to send in their old phones in exchange for payment, and then refurbishes and resells them, providing affordable phones to buyers and minimising waste.\n\nElsewhere, in a bid to combat e-waste in Africa, companies like Close The Gap offer digital training using old phones to young, unemployed people, primarily in East Africa. Similarly, Rainforest Connection has turned used phones into forest guardians. Equipped with solar charging capacity, these devices listen for illegal logging activity in vulnerable forests, helping in the fight against deforestation. \n\nNot only does the recycling or upcycling of phones protect the environment, but it also fosters social benefits. Some organisations, for instance, donate refurbished devices to the underprivileged, giving them access to vital digital services.\n\nIn an effort to promote such initiatives, various campaigns are raising awareness about the benefits of upcycling old devices. One such campaign is the Royal Society of Chemistry's \"New life for old phones\" initiative, which aims to educate the public about the valuable resources within their gadgets and the importance of recycling them.\n\nWhile we're still some way from mainstream phone recycling, these innovative initiatives show promise, presenting a world where upgrading your phone does not contribute to mounting landfills, rather leads to the education of an unemployed youth in Africa, the detection of illegal logging in rainforests, or the connection of a low",

The automotive and aerospace industries have been particularly affected, with thousands of jobs already lost.\n\nUnite, the country's largest trade union, has also voiced its concern. \"The government must act now to save our manufacturing jobs and invest in the future of this vital sector,\" said Unite's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. \"We need a clear, long-term industrial strategy that supports our manufacturers and promotes growth.\"\n\nThe government has responded to the calls, stating that it recognises the importance of the manufacturing sector and is committed to supporting it. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"We are working closely with the industry to understand the challenges it faces and will continue to provide support through our various business support schemes.\"\n\nHowever, critics argue that the current support measures are not enough and that more targeted assistance is needed to save jobs and stimulate growth in the sector. They are calling for a more proactive approach, including direct investment in key industries, increased support for research and development, and measures to promote skills training and apprenticeships.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is a crucial part of the UK economy, not only in terms of output and employment but also in driving innovation and regional development. The loss of manufacturing jobs would have far-reaching implications, affecting local communities and supply chains across the country. \n\nAs the UK navigates its post-Brexit future and continues",
    "Organised crime-themed video games have taken over the gaming charts, with titles such as \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Mafia: Definitive Edition\" leading the pack. This surge in popularity suggests a growing fascination among gamers for narratives that revolve around the underworld.\n\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\", developed by Rockstar Games, has consistently topped the charts since its release in 2013. The game, set in the fictional city of Los Santos, allows players to engage in a variety of criminal activities, from car theft to bank robberies. Its immersive storyline and open-world gameplay have made it a favourite among gamers worldwide.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Mafia: Definitive Edition\", a remake of the 2002 classic, has also seen a significant rise in sales. The game, developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K, takes players back to the Prohibition era, where they navigate the criminal underworld of the fictional city of Lost Heaven.\n\nThe success of these games is not just down to their engaging gameplay and high-quality graphics. The allure also lies in the narratives they offer, which often involve complex characters and moral dilemmas. These games provide players with an opportunity to explore a darker side of life, albeit in a virtual setting.\n\nHowever, the dominance of gangster-themed games in the charts has also sparked concerns among some critics. They argue that these games may glorify violence and criminal behaviour, potentially influencing impressionable young players. \n\nIn response, game developers and industry experts have highlighted the age ratings and parental controls available in these games. They also point out that video games, like movies and books, are a form of entertainment and storytelling, and should not be held solely responsible for influencing behaviour.\n\nDespite the controversy, the popularity of gangster-themed games shows no signs of waning. As technology continues to advance, gamers can expect even more immersive and complex narratives from the underworld in the future.",
    "In an effort to diversify its economic profile and reduce its reliance on oil, the Nigerian government has announced plans to significantly increase cocoa production over the next few years. This decision was made considering the recent unpredictable nature of the global oil markets and the detrimental impact it has had on Nigeria's economy.\n\nNigeria, the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer, exports nearly a quarter of its annual production, with imports primarily going to Europe. The government's plan to boost production will likely increase the nation’s export capabilities, while giving it a stronger foothold in the global cocoa market.\n\nThe government's strategy includes the modernisation of farming methods, improved access to agricultural financing, and the promotion of sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices amongst local farmers. This also includes the possibility of providing farmers with improved cocoa seedlings and training them on pruning and fermentation processes which could double yield.\n\n“By embracing new agricultural techniques and prioritizing cocoa crop, we hope to increase production from our current 250,000 tonnes output to 500,000 tonnes by 2024”, said Nigeria's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono. \n\nThis initiative is also likely to bring significant socio-economic benefits. Besides generating more revenue, increased cocoa production will create jobs, encouraging the younger generation to consider agriculture as an attractive field to work in. \n\nMr. Nanono emphasized the necessity for agricultural diversification, saying, \"Although oil and gas continue to dominate Nigeria's economic landscape, we have started to appreciate the value of 'green gold' that can additionally bolster our recovery and growth. The expansion of our cocoa industry can help to create a more diverse and sustainable economy.\"\n\nHowever, the plan faces several challenges. Ageing trees, lack of modern farming equipment, the absence of a futures market, and unpredictable weather patterns could hamper the efforts to increase cocoa production. The government has, in response, pledged to address these issues gradually, to ensure that their goal to provide a substantial cocoa yield becomes viable.\n\nRenewed emphasis on increasing cocoa production showcases Nigeria's intention to reduce dependency on oil and its determination to build a more diversified and resilient economy. It is a nod to both domestic economic demands and wider global sustainability trends, recognizing the need for economic activities that are both profitable and beneficial to farmers, the wider population, and the environment.",
    "Embattled Sports Minister, John Pearson, remains unyieldly amidst hefty criticism over the ongoing doping scandal that has tainted the reputation of British athletics.\n\nPearson faced robust questioning today in Parliament over allegations that the government mishandled intelligence on systemic performance-enhancing drug use in athletics.\n\nMembers from across the political spectrum joined in the questioning, as it emerged the Sport Ministry had received a classified report outlining alleged doping activities a month before the scandal broke out in the public domain. The document was from the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD), detailing suspected widespread use of banned substances within the athletic community.\n\nMany are criticizing the minister for the delayed response to the report, arguing that a swift and transparent approach would not only have served justice sooner but also could have protected the integrity of British sport from such a scandal. \n\nHowever, Pearson said in his defence, \"We have followed the appropriate protocols. As soon as we received the report, we asked UKAD for advice on the best way to address the problem, respecting the agency's independence and expertise. We were cautious about interfering with their investigations or compromising any potential legal processes.”\n\nThe row has grown since Britain's Olympians returned home last month. They brought back fewer medals than expected, raising questions about whether doping had tarnished their performances. The scandal has reached a fever pitch, following high-profile suspensions of two top athletes for failing drug tests.\n\nPearson is under more pressure due to the pending investigation into the source of leaked documents that revealed the scale of doping. There is speculation in political corridors that the leak came from within his ministry, although he has strongly denied these claims, insisting it was unauthorised and a breach of confidentiality.\n\nDespite these increasingly complex hurdles, Pearson remains resolute, adamant he will not step aside until the investigation is complete. He stated categorically, \"I will not resign. I respect the seriousness of the issue and I am committed to seeing this through.\"\n\nAs the minister digs in his heels over the doping row, the future of UK Athletics hangs in the balance. Only the passage of time and a rigorous investigation will reveal the extent of the doping scandal and its impact on Britain's tarnished reputation in world athletics.\n",
    "Former world champion marathon runner, Paula Radcliffe, is calling for a toughened stance against drug cheats in athletics. The retired British athlete, who set the record for fastest marathon for a female athlete back in 2003, has spoken out against leniency for doping in the sport.\n\nRadcliffe, renowned worldwide for her durability and fortitude, believes that the current system is too soft on athletes who are found guilty of substance abuse. She is advocating for stricter punitive measures to deter potential drug cheats from damaging the integrity of athletics.\n\nThe 47-year-old stated her belief that convicted users of performance-enhancing drugs should be given lifetime bans from competing. She pointed out that as long as there is only a small risk of punishment, some athletes will continue to be swayed by the allure of artificially enhanced performance.\n\nRadcliffe’s call comes amid mounting concern that the anti-doping regimen in athletics is failing to act as a robust deterrent. Several high-profile cases of doping have emerged in recent years, placing significant strain on the credibility and reputation of the sport.\n\nThe international governing body for athletics, World Athletics, currently imposes a four-year ban for athletes found guilty of doping for the first time. The second offence yields an additional eight-year suspension, effectively ending the career of the athlete.\n\nHowever, Radcliffe argues that this is insufficient. \"The punishment for drug cheats needs to be severe to the point where it's no longer a risk that's worth taking,\" she said. \"The threat of ruining their career might be the only thing that truly deters some individuals.\"\n\nAside from championing for a tougher stance on doping, Radcliffe is also asking for more reliable testing systems for substances that can enhance performance, better education for athletes, and a more consistent approach to dealing with those found guilty of doping. The marathon record-holder believes that these improvements are essential to restoring faith in athletics.\n\n\"We all want a level playing field,\" she commented. \"So every athlete has a fair shot at success. To allow that, we need significant changes to our current system.\"\n\nRadcliffe's calls for reform are echoed throughout the athletics community, with widespread agreement that the existing mechanisms for preventing doping are inadequate. It is hoped her impactful words will spark further dialogue, leading to more stringent policies to safeguard the integrity of the sport.",
    "Scientists have developed a 'brainwave' cap that allows users to control a computer using only their thoughts. The technology, which is still in its early stages, could revolutionise the way we interact with computers and potentially provide a lifeline for those with physical disabilities.\n\nThe cap, developed by a team of researchers at the University of California, San Diego, uses electroencephalogram (EEG) technology to monitor the electrical activity of the brain. The user simply thinks about moving a cursor on a screen, and the cap translates these thoughts into commands that the computer can understand.\n\nThe team, led by Dr. Thomas DeMarse, has been working on the project for several years. \"The idea is to create a direct interface between the brain and the computer,\" he explained. \"We're not reading minds, but we are picking up the electrical signals that the brain uses to control muscles.\"\n\nThe cap is fitted with 64 electrodes that pick up the brain's electrical signals. These signals are then amplified and sent to a computer, which uses machine learning algorithms to interpret the signals and translate them into commands.\n\nIn tests, users have been able to move a cursor around a screen, click on icons, and even type out words using a virtual keyboard. The technology is not yet perfect - it takes a lot of concentration and the cursor movement can be slow and jerky - but the team is optimistic about its potential.\n\n\"We're still in the early stages, but the results so far are promising,\" said Dr. DeMarse. \"With further development, we believe this technology could be used to control prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, or other devices.\"\n\nThe technology could also have applications in the gaming industry, allowing players to control video games with their thoughts. However, the team is primarily focused on its potential to help those with physical disabilities.\n\n\"We're really excited about the potential this technology has to improve the lives of people with disabilities,\" said Dr. DeMarse. \"Imagine being able to control your computer, your phone, or even your home with just your thoughts. It could be life-changing.\"\n\nThe team is now working on refining the technology and conducting further tests. They hope to have a commercially available product within the next five years.",
    "The movie-making industry behemoth, Disney, has thrown its weight behind Sony's DVD technology, providing it with a significant boost in the ongoing DVD format war. \n\nWalt Disney Company, known for its blockbuster movies and popular animation films, announced its support for the Blu-ray Disc, a high-definition DVD technology developed by Sony and the Blu-ray Disc Association. \n\nDuring an ongoing debate within the film industry about the future format of DVDs, Disney's decision swings the pendulum in favor of Sony. The two leading contenders for replacing the current DVD format are Blu-ray Disc led by Sony and the HD DVD backed by Toshiba. Both technologies claim superior quality, capacity, and data transfer; however, they are incompatible with each other. \n\nDisney's decision to back Sony's Blu-ray appears to be a strategic one. With the ability to store up to 50 gigabytes of data, nearly six times the capacity of the best HD DVD version, Blu-ray discs offer a richer viewing experience with better picture quality. \n\nBob Chapek, President of Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment division said, \"We certainly believe Blu-ray is the superior technology. It provides the most comprehensive entertainment experience.” He also underlined the format's ability to add substantial content that isn't possible on a current DVD.\n\n\"We believe that the Blu-ray technology will not only maintain consumers' high level of satisfaction with DVD but will provide even greater enjoyment as a result of advancements in interactivity and high-definition picture and sound quality,\" Chapek added.\n\nDisney’s decision marks another significant step toward Blu-ray's broader acceptance. Earlier, Twentieth Century Fox and Lionsgate announced their support for Sony’s technology. With some of Hollywood's biggest hitters backing Blu-ray, Sony's high-definition DVD format has certainly gained major momentum. \n\nThis, however, does not conclude the format war. Other significant industry players, like Universal Pictures, are backing HD DVD, which is cheaper to produce. Universal has insisted there is still room for both formats to co-exist.\n\nOn the consumer front, the outcome of the format war is significant, as very soon, those buying a new DVD player will need to decide between a Blu-ray or HD DVD player, with the knowledge that one or the other could potentially become obsolete.\nNevertheless, Disney's decision to back Sony underpins the fact that the race between the two technologies is far from over.\nOverall, the move shows how home entertainment's future will continue to be shaped by major parties seeking to protect their interests and make strategic alliances.",
    "California has passed a law that sets penalties for the use and distribution of spyware. The state legislation allows people to sue for damages if they are affected by software that covertly monitors their online habits or personal data. \n\nUnder the new law, individuals found guilty of employing or distributing spyware could face a fine of up to $1,000 and jail time of up to a year. Companies could also be slapped with fines of up to $5,000 for each day of violation.\n\nSpyware has rapidly become a significant issue in recent years, with millions of computer users worldwide falling victim. The intrusive software can collect private information and track web browsing habits without users' knowledge or consent.\n\nThe passing of the anti-spyware law represents a significant move by the US state to curb this growing problem. Alex Padilla, the Secretary of State of California, said: \"By recognizing spyware as a crime punishable by law, California is taking a stand against this invasive and harmful practice.\"\n\nOther measures included in the legislation include stricter penalties for companies knowingly distributing spyware. Not only are they liable to pay a hefty fine, but their activities could also be deemed unfair business practices, potentially leading to further legal action.\n\nBesides, the law also allows the court to order restitution in cases where victims have suffered losses as a result of spyware infection. Moreover, individuals who have been wronged by these deceptive practices can file lawsuits to recover damages.\n\nThe law has been welcomed by digital privacy advocates and cybersecurity firms. However, some critics argue that it may not be enough to deter spyware creators and distributors who operate beyond the confines of California or even the United States.\n\nSpyware has been linked to numerous cybercrimes worldwide, including identity theft, fraud, and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Cybersecurity experts hope that California's move will set a precedent for other states and nations to adopt similar measures.\n\n\"Spyware undermines the very essence of privacy and trust in the digital age. We must take tougher actions to banish it.\" Padilla added.\n\nThis law is expected to come into effect on January 1st, 2023, and is seen as an essential step towards offering greater protection to internet users. It is hoped that the stringent penalties will act as a potent deterrent, drastically reducing the prevalence of spyware.",

It also marks a significant comeback for the actor, whose recent films have not performed as well commercially.\n\nIndustry analysts attribute the film's success to a combination of De Niro's star power, a compelling storyline, and a strong marketing campaign. The film's performance is also seen as a positive sign for the industry, which has been grappling with the impact of streaming services and changing viewer habits.\n\nDe Niro's box office coup comes at a time when many veteran actors are struggling to maintain their relevance in an industry increasingly dominated by superhero films and franchise sequels.

    "Former Speaker of the House of Commons, Baroness Betty Boothroyd, has called for the House of Lords to have its own speaker. She believes that this would help to modernise the upper chamber and make it more accountable to the public.\n\nBaroness Boothroyd, who served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1992 to 2000, said that the Lords needed a speaker who could represent it to the outside world and defend its interests. She argued that the current arrangement, where the Lord Speaker has limited powers and the House is largely self-regulating, is outdated and lacks transparency.\n\n\"The House of Lords is a vital part of our parliamentary democracy,\" she said. \"But it needs to evolve and adapt to meet the challenges of the 21st century. A speaker with real authority could help to drive that change.\"\n\nBaroness Boothroyd's comments come amid ongoing debate about the role and size of the House of Lords, which is currently the second largest legislative assembly in the world after the National People's Congress of China. Critics argue that it is too large, too costly and lacks democratic legitimacy.\n\nThe Baroness suggested that a Lords speaker could be elected by members of the House, in the same way that the Speaker of the House of Commons is chosen. This, she said, would give the speaker a clear mandate and help to enhance the reputation of the Lords.\n\n\"The Speaker of the House of Commons is a well-known figure who is seen to stand up for the rights of MPs and the institution as a whole,\" she said. \"The Lords needs a similar figurehead.\"\n\nThe idea of a Lords speaker is not new. It was proposed by the Wakeham Commission on the reform of the House of Lords in 2000, but was not implemented. However, Baroness Boothroyd's intervention could give fresh impetus to the idea.\n\nThe current Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, has previously said that he would be open to the idea of a more powerful speaker role. However, any change would require legislation and could face opposition from some peers who value the Lords' tradition of self-regulation.\n\nBaroness Boothroyd's call for a Lords speaker is likely to reignite the debate about the future of the House of Lords and its role in the UK's parliamentary democracy. It remains to be seen whether her proposal will gain traction among her fellow peers and the wider political establishment.",

He said, \"Phillips is in great shape - physically and mentally. He has had a great run-up to the European Championships and I firmly believe he could bring home a gold\".\n\nIdowu, 31, has consistently been a standout performer for Britain at the world stage. This year alone, he has won silver medals at the World Athletics Indoor Championships and Commonwealth Games. He is one of Great Britain's biggest hopes for a medal at the European Championships, which run from 26 August to 1 September.\n\n\"I've watched Phillips over the years and his progression in the sport has been remarkable,\" continued Edwards. \"He thrives in high-pressure environments and I don't see the European Championships as any different\".\n\nEdwards, who won the Olympic gold for the triple jump event in Sydney 2000, retired from the sport in 2003. Today, he remains closely involved in athletics and is too aware of the mental and physical strain that athletes like Idowu face.\n\nSpeaking on Idowu's chances in Paris, Edwards said, \"Phillips has the calibre and the experience. He has previously competed against some of the best in the world and has come out on top. His mental strength and determination to succeed set him apart.\"\n\nEdwards' endorsement comes as Idowu prepares to face tough competition from European opponents, including French athlete Teddy Tamgho, who secured the world indoor record last year.\n\nHowever, Edwards believes that Idowu has the edge. \"It will be a close contest\", he said, \"but it's gold or nothing for Phillips.

    "The Christmas spirit has been disturbed by an unwelcome visitor this year, an internet worm named 'Santy'. This malicious software has been wreaking havoc throughout websites worldwide during the festive season. \n\nThe Santy worm targets the PHP bulletin board system, a common format used by many websites for online discussions. Upon infestation, this worm changes websites to display the message: \"This site is defaced!!! This site is defaced!!! NeverEverNoSanity WebWorm generation.\"\n\nRecent reports have confirmed that approximately 40,000 websites were affected worldwide within 24 hours of the worm’s release. Varying from online businesses to personal blogs, these sites were left with the aforementioned disturbing message in place of their usual content. \n\nExperts reckon that the worm uses the Google search engine to find new sites to attack. Once the Santy worm infects a PHP bulletin board, it starts to create multiple threads. Each of them searches for more bulletin boards through Google. Due to the exponential increase in the number of threads, websites experience frequent crashes. \n\nGoogle has been notified of the worm's activities and has already taken steps to stop it from accessing the search engine. Said a representative, “We are aware of the situation and have steps in place to defend against this issue.” However, the sheer number of sites affected by the worm is showing just how challenging it is to stop its rampage entirely.\n\nThe authors of the PHP bulletin board system are set to release an upgrade to the system that will make it more resistant to the attacks by the worm. Website administrators across the spectrum are waiting eagerly for this update so they can restore their websites back to their original nature.\n\nIronically, this worm was named after the Santa Claus, the symbol of joy and happiness during the Christmas season. Instead of spreading cheer, the Santy worm has brought a clear disruption to the festive spirit.\n\nCybersecurity companies have been urging businesses and individuals to improve their online security measures. In these evolving digital times, it's essential more than ever, to take care of not just our physical security but also our digital one.\n\nThe Santy worm’s unwelcome visit once again underscores the risks inherent in our interconnected virtual world. It serves as a stark reminder that the web is not just a network of webs, but also a potential highway for digital malevolence. This Christmas, the urgent call clearly is to shield businesses and personal digital estates by taking cyber threats seriously.\n",
    "As the world becomes increasingly digital, the environmental impact of our technology use is becoming a growing concern. Computers, in particular, are a significant contributor to electronic waste and energy consumption. However, there are ways to make your computer usage more environmentally friendly. \n\nFirstly, consider the energy efficiency of your computer. Many modern computers come with energy-saving features, such as sleep mode or automatic shutdown after a period of inactivity. Make sure these features are enabled to reduce your computer's energy consumption. Additionally, consider investing in a laptop rather than a desktop computer, as laptops typically use less energy.\n\nSecondly, think about the lifespan of your computer. The longer a computer lasts, the less electronic waste is produced. Regular maintenance, such as cleaning and software updates, can help extend the lifespan of your computer. When it's time to upgrade, consider buying a refurbished computer rather than a brand new one. Refurbished computers are often just as good as new ones, but they generate less waste as they reuse existing components.\n\nThirdly, consider the materials used in your computer. Many computers contain harmful substances such as lead and mercury. Look for computers that are made with fewer harmful substances and more recycled materials. Some manufacturers even offer take-back programs, where they will recycle your old computer for you.\n\nFourthly, think about how you use your computer. Do you really need to print that document, or could you read it on screen? Can you reduce your data usage by downloading files rather than streaming them? Small changes in behaviour can have a big impact on the environmental footprint of your computer.\n\nFinally, consider the end of your computer's life. When it's time to dispose of your computer, don't just throw it in the bin. Many components of a computer can be recycled, and there are many organisations that will take your old computer and ensure it is disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.\n\nIn conclusion, while computers are a necessary part of modern life, there are many ways we can reduce their environmental impact. By considering energy efficiency, lifespan, materials, usage, and disposal, we can all make our computers a little greener.",
    "In a scintillating display of talent, Sam Yelling achieved a remarkable hat-trick at Cardiff's annual marathon, marking him as a rising star in British marathon running.\n\nTaking place yesterday, the marathon saw Yelling battling adverse weather conditions and stiff competition, yet emerging victorious for the third consecutive year. The 28-year-old Royal Army officer completed the 26.2-mile course in 2 hours, 14 minutes, and 31 seconds -- 36 seconds faster than his closest rival.\n\nYelling, a Hampshire native, proved his world-class credentials with a faultless performance. He started strong, setting the pace in the throng of competitors, before striding ahead of them during the final stages of the race to retain his title.\n\n\"It's an incredible feeling,\" a visibly elated Yelling commented post-race. \"This is the hardest race physically and mentally I've ever done, and to have won it three times now is just unbelievable.\"\n\nHis golden streak began back in 2019 and has gone unbroken since, marking Yelling as the first participant to achieve a hat-trick win in the history of the Cardiff Marathon. \n\nHundreds of spectators lined the wet, cold streets to witness Yelling make history, their cheers echoing across the city. Yelling’s triumph is already causing a buzz in the international marathon circles, with many experts earmarking him as a potential Olympic contender for the impending games.\n\nYelling expressed his gratitude to his trainers and his family, who have supported him throughout his journey. \"My family has been with me every step of the way,\" Yelling said, trying to hold back his emotions. \"Their tireless support and encouragement have driven me to push my limits.\"\n\nThe Cardiff Marathon, Wales’ largest mass participation and multi-charity fundraising event, witnessed over 20,000 participants this year, from elite professional athletes to fundraising heroes running for causes close to their hearts.\n\nYelling's victory provided a significant morale boost to the organisers, athletes, and the spectators alike, showcasing the sheer determination and resilience of a true sportsman. His victory served to remind everyone that even in the most uncertain times, there is a steadfast spirit in people to push beyond their boundaries and achieve greatness.\nCommenting on his future plans, Yelling said, \"This win has just strengthened my resolve. I aim to keep improving and make my mark at the Olympic level.\"",
    "Senior Labour Party officials have denied reports that former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is being lined up to play a leading role in the party's campaign for the next general election. \n\nRumours have been circulating in Westminster that Mr Brown, who led the party from 2007 to 2010, was being considered for a prominent role in the campaign. The speculation was fuelled by Mr Brown's recent high-profile interventions on issues such as Brexit and Scottish independence.\n\nHowever, a senior Labour Party source told the BBC that there was \"no truth\" in the reports. \"Gordon Brown is a valued member of the Labour Party and his views are always welcome,\" the source said. \"But there are no plans for him to take a leading role in the election campaign.\"\n\nMr Brown, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Tony Blair before becoming Prime Minister, has largely stayed out of frontline politics since stepping down as Labour leader following the party's defeat in the 2010 general election.\n\nIn recent months, he has made a series of speeches and written articles on key political issues, leading to speculation that he was preparing for a return to a more active role in the party.\n\nBut the Labour source said: \"Gordon Brown has always been clear that his role now is to contribute to the debate on the big issues facing our country, not to return to frontline politics.\"\n\nThe denial comes as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer prepares to launch the party's campaign for the next general election, which is due to take place in 2024.\n\nSir Keir has faced criticism from some quarters of the party for his leadership style and policy direction, leading to speculation about potential challenges to his position.\n\nHowever, the Labour source dismissed suggestions that Mr Brown was being lined up as a potential successor to Sir Keir. \"There is no leadership contest in the Labour Party and there are no plans for one,\" the source said. \"Our focus is on holding the government to account and preparing for the next general election.\"\n\nMr Brown has not commented on the reports.",
    "The Liberal Democrats have launched a dedicated manifesto focusing on women's rights and gender equality. The party's leader, Sir Ed Davey, unveiled the manifesto, which outlines a series of policies aimed at addressing the gender pay gap, improving women's health and safety, and promoting women's participation in politics.\n\nThe manifesto, titled \"Empowering Women\", includes a commitment to introduce a law requiring companies with more than 250 employees to publish data on gender pay gaps. The Lib Dems also pledge to extend the use of gender pay gap reporting to include data on race and disability.\n\nIn terms of health, the party promises to tackle inequalities in women's healthcare, with a particular focus on improving access to mental health services. The manifesto also includes a commitment to end period poverty by providing free sanitary products to those in need.\n\nOn the issue of safety, the Lib Dems propose to invest in services that support victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence. They also plan to introduce a new law to tackle online abuse and harassment, which disproportionately affects women.\n\nThe manifesto also addresses the underrepresentation of women in politics. The Lib Dems pledge to ensure that at least 40% of their parliamentary candidates are women. They also propose measures to support women in leadership roles, such as offering training and mentoring programmes.\n\nSir Ed Davey said, \"This manifesto is a comprehensive plan to address the systemic inequalities that women face in our society. We believe that by empowering women, we can create a fairer, more equal society.\"\n\nThe unveiling of the women's manifesto comes as the Lib Dems seek to position themselves as the party of equality ahead of the upcoming general election. However, critics argue that the party needs to do more to address gender inequality within its own ranks, pointing out that only a third of Lib Dem MPs are women.\n\nThe party's women's spokesperson, Christine Jardine, defended the party's record on gender equality, saying, \"We are committed to doing everything we can to promote women's rights and gender equality. This manifesto is a clear demonstration of that commitment.\"\n\nThe Lib Dems' women's manifesto is thought to be the first of its kind in British politics. It remains to be seen how these proposals will resonate with voters, and whether they will help the party to make gains in the upcoming election.",
    "Chinese aviation company, China Aviation, is currently seeking a rescue deal to reduce its potentially crippling debt burden, according to industry insiders. The move comes after a series of financial struggles caused by the global slowdown in air travel and decrease in aircraft demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe national carrier has approached several local and international financiers for assistance, including the Chinese government and a consortium of global investment banks. Specific details of the rescue deal have not yet been disclosed but are believed to include debt restructuring options and a potential equity injection. \n\nThe aviation industry worldwide has been hit hard by the pandemic and China Aviation is not an exception. Although domestic travel is gradually recovering in China, international travels are still significantly down, which greatly affects the profitability of aviation companies. \n\n\"Faced with a dramatic decrease in revenue, we are looking at a range of measures, including financial restructuring and seeking external investment,\" says a spokesperson for China Aviation. He further added that the company is \"working tirelessly to protect the interests of our shareholders, staff, and customers as we navigate through the current turbulent times.\"\n\nAccording to market analysts, China Aviation's situation reflects the broader difficulties faced by the global aviation sector. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts that airlines worldwide will lose more than $300bn this year, and many will not survive without state-backed rescue deals. \n\nThe airline's business partners, aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing, have also been deeply affected by the crisis, with both companies experiencing a decrease in orders as airlines adjust their business plans to current demand.\n\nNegotiations and discussions with potential investors are ongoing, but no definite agreements have been reached yet.  The company assured that further announcements will be made when there are significant developments. The Chinese government, which has a significant stake in China Aviation, has yet to comment publicly on the matter.\n\nMany airlines are in survival mode as they reduce operations and furlough staff to cut costs. Companies are forced to consider innovative solutions, alliances, and mergers to survive the financial losses caused by the pandemic. The rescue deal for China Aviation is crucial and it needs to be finalized swiftly to prevent further financial distress for the struggling company.\n",
    "British filmmaker Arran Alexander has suffered a setback as his much-anticipated movie recorded a disappointing box office report in its opening week.\n\nAlexander's latest venture, 'Distant Warriors', opened last weekend to lacklustre audience response and managed to rake in only £1.5 million in the UK. This dismal performance is significantly below the £6 million it grossed in the US during the same period.\n\nThe film, budgeted at an estimated £35 million, is a historic epic portraying the world of medieval knights. Despite an ensemble cast featuring A-list celebrities and extensive promotions, 'Distant Warriors' failed to strike a chord with the viewers.\n\nCritics have cited the screenplay's pacing and heavy reliance on historical accuracy over character development as some of the main reasons for the film's underperformance. Veteran film critic Martin White stated, \"The film lacked the human touch. While the sets and costumes are stunning, the narrative falls flat.\"\n\nThis is a significant setback for Arran Alexander, known for his previous commercial hits like 'Intrepid' and 'The Last Heiress.' To recover the production and marketing costs, 'Distant Warriors' needs to perform exceptionally well in global markets, which remains uncertain.\n\nFollowing the disappointing response at the box office, Alexander issued a statement thanking his team for their hard work and dedication. \"I am proud of 'Distant Warriors' and fully stand by our work. We have received positive feedback from the audiences who have seen it. We hope that more people will see its value as time goes on,\" he said.\n\nIt is worth noting that Arran Alexander's films have historically taken time to pick pace and have displayed a consistent trend of gaining traction following initial slow starts. However, the director has admitted that the film industry's unpredictability makes it tough to determine whether this trend will hold for 'Distant Warriors.'\n\nIn the light of strong competition from other releases during the same period, the performance of 'Distant Warriors' in the coming weeks will be crucial in determining parameters of success for this latest release from the acclaimed director. The film's fate may significantly influence Arran Alexander's future ventures and the expectations that industry and audiences have of him.\n\nFor now, the world of film awaits to see if this cinematic narration of medieval valour can rebound from its initial disappointment and eventually find its footing at the domestic and global box office.\n",

    "News Corp, a global media company, has announced its intention to acquire Fox for a staggering $5.4 billion, in a move that could significantly reshape the global media landscape.\n\nRupert Murdoch's News Corp made the takeover bid for the broadcasting and entertainment conglomerate, upping the ante in an industry grappling to consolidate amidst the rapidly changing digital environment. The deal grossly expands News Corp network, which already includes brands such as The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and The Times.\n\nThe proposed acquisition offers further evidence of Mr. Murdoch’s desire to consolidate his global news and entertainment media empire. Fox's vast portfolio includes numerous television broadcasters in various countries, movie studios and cable networks.\n\nA merger of this magnitude would provide News Corp with a more diverse array of media assets, enhancing its dominance in the industry. It would also mark the first time that News Corp has ventured into the broadcasting sector on such a large scale.\n\nThe deal represents another potential reshaping of the media industry at a time when traditional media companies are seeking to bolster their offerings in the face of increasing competition from digital platforms.\n\nThis is not the first time Murdoch has attempted a massive deal of this kind. In 2017, News Corp made a failed bid to fully acquire Sky News, an attempt that ended due to regulatory concerns and competition.\n\nNeither Fox nor News Corp immediately commented officially on the offer. The final decision will likely rest with regulators who will have to review the potential impact of the deal on competition.\n\nAnalysts are speculating on what potential regulatory hurdles might lay ahead. Given the size and potential impact of this deal on the global media industry, their decision will be closely watched.\n\nThe proposed deal, if passed through regulators, would potentially be the largest-ever acquisition in the media industry, highlighting the massive consolidation taking place as companies seek to adapt to the increasingly digitized media landscape.\n\nIndustry experts argue that the deal could potentially limit the degree of competition in the market, leading to increased prices for consumers. On the other hand, they also indicate that the merger could lead to greater innovation and diversity in programming and content as conglomerates attempt to attract larger audiences. \n\nNews Corp shareholders appeared to welcome the news, with shares in the company rising by 1.4% at the close of trading. Meanwhile, Fox’s stock also experienced a slight surge. Consequently, this could be a significant development for investors in both beasts of the global media industry. Yet, the journey to the merger is bound to be dotted with plenty of challenges and scrutiny. \n\nWith this development, the",
    "The year 2004 saw a striking upturn in cyber crime incidents according to a report published by the National Crime Agency (NCA). The surge in incidents highlights the growing threat posed by increasingly sophisticated hacking techniques and the vulnerability of both individuals and corporations alike.\n\nThe report, based on figures collated by the NCA throughout the year, reveals the scale of the problem in stark detail. At least 33,000 cases of cyber crime were reported in the course of the year, an unprecedented increase of 37% compared to the previous year. This rise in activity tallies with claims from cybersecurity firms, who have reported a steady increase in cyber crime business throughout 2004.\n\nFraud, identity theft and cyberbullying have been identified as the most prevalent types of cyber crime. The report also showed a concerning surge in online child exploitation cases, showing a steady increase over the past year.\n\nThe damage inflicted by these cyber criminals is significant - not just in the financial cost, which averages several billion pounds but also in the personal distress caused amongst victims. This has sparked a vocal outcry for greater action from the government and law enforcement agencies to combat this escalating problem.\n\nProfessor Kevin Curran, a cyber security specialist from Ulster University, warned against complacency and urged for a robust defence mechanism. \"There's no denying the rise in cyber crime incidents poses a significant threat to both individuals and organisations. We need to match this rising threat with greater vigilance and a strong cyber security infrastructure.\"\n\nThe NCA further stressed the importance of cybersecurity education. \"This isn't just about stopping the criminals, it's about making sure the public and businesses know how to protect themselves. Cybersecurity isn't a one-off issue, it's something we need to integrate into our daily lives,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe government has pledged to tackle this burgeoning issue, having recently announced a £1.9 billion funding boost to cybersecurity defences over the next five years. The increase in funding aims to counter the threat and to fund much-needed training for cybersecurity specialists. \n\nIt's worth noting, however, that the full scale of the problem might be even more extensive than the report suggests. Many cyber crime incidents go unreported due to the victims' fear of losing face or the misguided belief that nothing can be done about it.\n\nMeanwhile, cyber security firms are warning that this problem will only intensify in the coming years unless drastic measures are taken to improve online security. Indeed, if 2004's dramatic figures are any indication, the world of cyber crime is a growing",

He went on to claim silver at the 2004 Athens Olympics, but has struggled to replicate that form in recent years.\n\nInjuries have hampered his progress, and he failed to make the British team for the 2016 Rio Olympics. However, he remains determined to compete at the highest level and believes Christie can help him achieve his goals.\n\n\"Linford has a wealth of experience and knowledge, and I'm looking forward to learning from him,\" said Lewis-Francis. \"I'm confident that with his guidance, I can get back to my best.\"\n\nChristie, who also won 100m silver at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, has previously mentored other British sprinters, including Dwain Chambers and Darren Campbell.

Since then, the creature has featured in more than 30 films in Japan and Hollywood, becoming a global pop culture phenomenon.\n\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced the honour, stating that Godzilla's star would be the 2,694th on the Walk of Fame. The star was unveiled in a ceremony attended by a host of celebrities, film industry veterans, and fans of the monster.\n\n\"Godzilla is a true icon, a bridge between cultures, and a testament to the power of creativity and imagination,\" said Rana Ghadban, President and CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. \"We are thrilled to honour this cinematic legend with a star on our historic Walk of Fame.\"\n\nThe star was placed near the TCL Chinese Theatre, a fitting location given Godzilla's cinematic history. The unveiling ceremony included a special appearance by a person dressed in a Godzilla costume, much to the delight of the crowd.\n\nThe awarding of the star coincides with the 68th anniversary of the release of the original \"Godzilla\" film by Toho Studios in Japan. The film was a metaphor for nuclear destruction, reflecting the fears of post-war Japan. Over the years, Godzilla has evolved, symbolising various social and environmental issues.\n\nGodzilla's Hollywood fame star is a recognition of the monster's enduring appeal and its impact on popular culture. The creature has not only been a box office success but has also inspired countless books, video games, and merchandise.\n\nThe most recent Godzilla film, \"Godzilla vs. Kong,\" was a global hit, grossing over $467 million worldwide.

The star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame cements Godzilla's status as a true cinematic icon, a monster that has transcended cultural and language barriers to become a global phenomenon.\n\nAs Godzilla joins the ranks of Hollywood's most celebrated figures, it's clear that this monster's reign in popular culture is far from over.",
    "A UK-based company is embroiled in a land dispute with the Venezuelan government, raising concerns over property rights and foreign investment in the South American nation. \n\nThe company, which has not been named, is reportedly facing the threat of expropriation of its land holdings in Venezuela. The dispute has escalated in recent weeks, with the Venezuelan government asserting its right to reclaim land for public use.\n\nThe UK firm has been operating in Venezuela for over two decades, primarily in the agricultural sector. It owns several large tracts of land, some of which are used for farming and others for manufacturing. The company has made significant investments in the country, contributing to local employment and economic growth.\n\nHowever, the Venezuelan government, led by President Nicolas Maduro, has recently ramped up efforts to nationalise key industries and redistribute land to local communities. This policy has led to a series of disputes with foreign companies operating in the country.\n\nThe UK firm has strongly contested the government's claims, arguing that it has always operated within the law and contributed significantly to the Venezuelan economy. It has also warned that the dispute could deter future foreign investment in the country.\n\nThe British government has expressed concern over the situation, with the Foreign Office stating that it is closely monitoring the situation and is in contact with the company. A spokesperson said, \"We are deeply concerned about the potential expropriation of British assets in Venezuela. We are providing support to the company and are in regular contact with the Venezuelan authorities.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan government has not yet commented on the dispute. However, President Maduro has previously defended his land reform policies, arguing that they are necessary to address inequality and promote economic development.\n\nThe dispute comes at a time of heightened economic and political tension in Venezuela, with the country facing severe economic crisis and widespread protests against the government. Critics argue that the government's policies are exacerbating the crisis, while supporters claim they are necessary to redistribute wealth and resources.\n\nThe outcome of the dispute could have significant implications for foreign companies operating in Venezuela, and for the country's relationship with international investors. It also raises broader questions about property rights and the role of the state in the economy.",

    "The UK government is set to give the green light to the Crossrail link, a major rail project that will connect Reading and Heathrow in the west with Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east via central London. \n\nThe project, which has been under discussion for several years, is expected to significantly improve transport links across the capital and beyond, reducing journey times and easing congestion on existing routes. \n\nThe Crossrail link, also known as the Elizabeth Line, will be more than 60 miles long and will include 41 stations. It is expected to increase London's rail transport capacity by 10%, carrying over half a million passengers each day. \n\nThe decision to proceed with the project comes after a comprehensive review of its costs and benefits. The project has faced criticism for its escalating costs, which have risen from an initial estimate of £14.8bn in 2010 to over £18bn. However, supporters argue that the long-term benefits of the project, including job creation and economic growth, will outweigh the initial investment.\n\nTransport Secretary, Grant Shapps, is expected to make the formal announcement later this week. He said: \"This is a significant moment for London and the UK. The Crossrail link will transform travel across the capital, boosting the economy and creating thousands of jobs.\"\n\nConstruction work on the project is already well underway, with the majority of the tunneling completed. Once the go-ahead is given, the focus will shift to the fitting out of the stations and the testing of the new trains.\n\nThe first services on the Crossrail link are expected to start running in 2022, with the full route operational by the end of 2023.\n\nThe project is being delivered by Crossrail Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL), in partnership with the Department for Transport.\n\nMayor of London, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the news, saying: \"The Crossrail link is vital for the future of London's economy and will make a real difference to the lives of Londoners, reducing journey times and improving connectivity across the city.\"\n\nHowever, critics have warned that the project must be delivered on time and within budget to avoid further cost overruns. They also argue that more needs to be done to ensure the benefits of the project are felt across the whole of London, not just in the areas directly served by the new line.",
    "The property insurance sector has faced a turbulent year, with a surge in claims due to extreme weather events, according to industry reports. The increased frequency and intensity of storms, floods, and wildfires globally have led to significant financial losses, putting immense pressure on property insurers.\n\nThe Insurance Information Institute (III) reported that insurers paid out an estimated $82 billion in property damage claims in 2021, a 59% increase from the previous year. This figure is the highest since 2017 when insurers had to deal with the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\n\nThe rise in claims has been attributed to the increasing number of extreme weather events, which scientists say are being exacerbated by climate change. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that such events are likely to become more frequent and severe in the future.\n\n\"Insurers are on the front line of climate change, bearing the brunt of increased claims due to extreme weather events,\" said Michael Menhart, Chief Economist at Munich Re, one of the world's leading reinsurers. \"This is a trend that is likely to continue and could potentially reshape the industry.\"\n\nThe impact of these weather-related claims has been felt across the industry, with many insurers reporting a decline in profits. Some companies have been forced to increase premiums, while others have withdrawn from high-risk areas altogether.\n\nIn the UK, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) reported that the cost of weather-related claims tripled in 2021, reaching a record £1.3 billion. The ABI warned that the increase in claims could lead to higher insurance premiums for homeowners.\n\nIn the US, the situation is similar. The III reported that homeowners' insurance premiums rose by an average of 3.7% in 2021, the largest increase in a decade. The rise was even steeper in states that have been hit hard by hurricanes and wildfires.\n\nThe property insurance industry is now grappling with how to adapt to this new reality. Some insurers are investing in advanced technology to better predict and manage risks, while others are lobbying for stricter building codes and better land use planning.\n\nHowever, there is a growing consensus that more needs to be done to mitigate the impact of climate change. \"The insurance industry can't solve this problem alone,\" said Menhart. \"We need a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build more resilient communities.\"\n\nAs the world continues to grapple with the effects of climate change, the property insurance sector is bracing itself for more stormy",
    "Ukraine has revised its privatisation plan significantly, reducing the expected earnings from a series of state assets sale.\n\nOriginally, Ukraine eyed up to £17bn from selling some of its largest state enterprises, as part of its international bail-out agreement. However, the updated plan anticipates raising only a fraction of this amount, around £400m.\n\nVitaliy Kovalchuk, First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine, announced during a media briefing that the sum total projection has been reduced because of the current challenging market conditions and strong opposition from various sectors. He acknowledged that the initial expectations might have been \"overly optimistic.\"\n\n“For various reasons, mainly due to lower global commodity prices, the attractiveness for potential investors to a variety of our state properties has decreased. Hence the income from privatisation will be significantly lower than we previously thought,\" he commented.\n\nUkraine, struggling with economic crisis amid ongoing political unrest and conflict with Russia, desperately needs to fill its depleted state coffers. The decision to sell state assets at auction forms part of its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has arranged an $18bn (£14bn) financial aid package for the beleaguered country.\n\nSome major assets remain on the auction block as Ukraine tries to woo foreign investors, including the Odessa Portside Plant, the country's second-largest publicly-owned company and one of the world's largest ammonia transshipment facilities. However, several planned auctions have already failed due to lack of interest or inadequate bids.\n\nCritics fear that these assets could be sold at undervalued prices, not reflecting their actual worth, given the cash-strapped country's urgent need for funds.\n\nThey also argue that the privatisation process lacks transparency and can lead to corruption as the country battles with ongoing war and unstable political environment. \n\nUkraine's government maintains that the asset sales are necessary, arguing that they will be conducted with transparency, improve economy, and fulfill Ukraine's commitment to its international partners.\n\nThe government's revised privatisation goals indicate the challenges it faces in striking a balance between securing desperately-needed funds while securing a fair price for its assets amid a daunting economic and geopolitical climate.",
    "Former Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, now known as Baron Kinnock of Bedwellty, has made his debut in the House of Lords. The iconic former MP for Islwyn, who led the Labour party for nearly a decade from 1983 to 1992, was welcomed in the Upper House, amid discussions on the government's agenda and the future of the UK post-Brexit.\n\nBaron Kinnock was introduced to the House by former Labour policy coordinator, Baron Stewart Wood, and former Labour leader, Baroness Smith of Basildon. He appeared composed during his formal introduction, clad in the traditional red and gold robe, and swearing an oath to the monarch.\n\nBaron Kinnock's entry into the House of Lords follows his political tenure spanning over three decades, including roles such as vice-president of the European Commission and a brief stint as a university professor. The former Labour leader's elevation to the peerage signifies his long-lasting influence on British politics.\n\nIn his career, Kinnock has been widely recognised as a figure known for his passionate debates, reforming the Labour party, and combating left-wing sectarians within the Labour movement. Moreover, his vocal commitment to Europe and staunch opposition to Brexit remain key aspects of his political identity.\n\nHis addition to the House of Lords has been met with mixed responses. Supporters believe his vast experience and strong views will provide a valuable contribution to the debates and decisions at the Upper House, while critics argue his elevation is a classic example of cronyism.\n\nCommenting on his new role, Baron Kinnock said, \"I am looking forward to contributing to the work of the Lords, especially on issues such as social justice, employment rights and Britain's place in the world, and to supporting the Labour party in holding the government to account.\"\n\nWhile Baron Kinnock's political career has seen several highs and lows, his induction into the Lords provides a new chapter and possibly a new platform for influence in British politics. With the complexity of the post-Brexit political landscape, the former Labour leader's presence in the Lords will undoubtedly add a vibrant and substantial voice to ongoing debates.",
    "Tennis icon, Marat Safin, suffered an unexpected defeat in the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, bowing to an opponent who was well below his ranking. Safin, a former world number one, former US Open and Australian Open winner, was thought to steamroll through the earlier rounds but his journey was cut short by a less recognized rival.\n\nThe grueling match took a toll on Safin who played brilliantly through the first set but was inexplicably unable to maintain the rhythm in the subsequent ones. His opponent seized on this inconsistency, demonstrating a commendable control on nerves and a sound strategic game. This shocking result sent ripples through the tournament, underlining once again that in sport, nothing is guaranteed.\n\nLeaving the court, Safin looked visibly disgruntled, frustrated at his own performance and the missed opportunity to progress in a tournament he has previously dominated. Fans, who had turned out in numbers to see the former world No.1, were left equally stunned and disappointed.\n\nSafin's approach to the match had noticeably shifted after losing a crucial point in the second set, causing analysts to speculate whether his once unshakeable confidence had started to wobble. Safin, known for his fiery temperament on court, was unable to recapture the initial momentum that had put him in charge of the match.\n\nDespite the shock loss, it is too early to write off Safin's chances for the rest of the sporting season. The year is still young, and there are ample opportunities for Safin to get back to winning ways. But he would likely need to address the shortcomings displayed during this game in Dubai to emerge as the force he once was.\n\nThe tennis fraternity is no stranger to such shocks. Time and again, underdogs have emerged victorious against titans much to the surprise of analysts, players, and supporters alike. While this makes for intriguing drama, it also underlines the unpredictability and charm of this timeless sport.\n\nFrom the spectator’s perspective, while they were robbed of an anticipated Safin victory, they were treated to a classic underdog triumph. In true sporting spirit, they applauded the victor of today's match, however shocking it might have been. Safin's defeat, as shocking as it was, just goes to show the range of talent and the level of unpredictability that the sport offers.\n",
    "UK Coal, the country's largest coal producer, has reported a significant increase in its annual losses, raising concerns about the future of the struggling industry. \n\nThe company reported a pre-tax loss of £143m for the year ending December 2021, compared to a loss of £83m in the previous year. This marks a 72% increase in losses, reflecting the ongoing challenges faced by the coal industry amid declining demand and increasing environmental regulations.\n\nUK Coal's revenues also fell by 20% to £120m, down from £150m in 2020. The company attributed the decline to a combination of lower coal prices and reduced production levels. The company's coal production fell by 15% to 2.5 million tonnes, down from 2.9 million tonnes in the previous year.\n\nThe company's deepening financial woes come at a time when the UK government is seeking to phase out coal power by 2024 as part of its commitment to reduce carbon emissions. The move has put additional pressure on UK Coal and other coal producers, who are grappling with the dual challenges of falling demand and the need to transition to cleaner forms of energy.\n\nUK Coal's Chief Executive, John Smith, said the company was facing \"unprecedented challenges\". He added: \"The market conditions are tough, and the regulatory environment is becoming increasingly difficult. We are doing everything we can to navigate through these challenges and secure the future of the business.\"\n\nDespite the bleak outlook, Mr Smith said the company was exploring various options to improve its financial position, including potential asset sales and cost-cutting measures. He also highlighted the company's efforts to diversify its business by investing in renewable energy projects.\n\nHowever, industry analysts warn that the company's survival is far from certain. \"UK Coal is in a precarious position,\" said James Leonard, an energy analyst at Investec. \"The company's financial health is deteriorating, and it's unclear whether it can successfully transition to a post-coal future.\"\n\nThe UK's coal industry has been in decline for several decades, with many mines closing and thousands of jobs lost. The industry's decline has been accelerated by the UK government's commitment to reduce carbon emissions and the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy sources.\n\nUK Coal's latest financial results highlight the ongoing challenges faced by the coal industry and raise questions about the future of coal mining in the UK.",
    "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has publicly opposed the idea of London's Mayor Sadiq Khan issuing an apology over recent controversial decisions.\n\nMr Johnson's disagreement came to light after Mayor Khan was heavily criticised over the handling of the congestion charge scheme and removal of statues during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThe Prime Minister fuelled the dispute during Prime Minister’s Questions, stating that he sees \"no reason\" for the Mayor of London to make a public apology.\n\n\"I believe that Sadiq Khan is doing a remarkably good job in difficult circumstances,\" Johnson said, in stark contrast to his Conservative peers who have been slamming the Labour Mayor.\n\nThe congestion charge scheme, rolled out to reduce traffic and pollution in the city, has faced scrutiny for its supposed negative impact on businesses and lower-income families.\n \nMoreover, Mayor Khan’s decision to remove contentious historical statues, following the international Black Lives Matter protests, has led critics to suggest he is ‘erasing history’.\n\nPublic disagreement amongst political leaders is not uncommon, but it does divert attention towards the management of Britain's capital city, especially considering the current challenges posed by the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n\"The Prime Minister's comments today reinforce that it is important to make careful and considerate decisions about our city's infrastructure and cultural heritage,\" said a spokesperson for Mayor Khan.\n\n\"He will continue working hard to address the challenges that London is facing, and he appreciates the support from the Prime Minister.”\n\nCriticism of Khan’s decisions is anticipated, considering London's influence and status. However, the current criticism seems to be blurring into a partisan dispute, with conservatives regularly critiquing his decisions while Labour officials defend his actions.\n\nWith the Prime Minister's comments, it seems that this particular apology will not be coming anytime soon. Whether the criticism will affect Khan's re-election campaign next year is uncertain, but it certainly adds an additional challenge for the embattled mayor.",
    "Leading figures in the open source community have criticised the patent system, arguing that it stifles innovation and hampers technological progress. They have called for a comprehensive review of the current patent laws, which they claim are outdated and unsuitable for the digital age.\n\nRichard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, and Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux operating system, are among those who have voiced their concerns. They argue that the patent system, originally designed to protect inventors and encourage innovation, is now being used as a weapon to hinder competition and maintain monopolies.\n\n\"The patent system is broken,\" Stallman said. \"It's being used to crush innovation, not foster it. We need a complete overhaul of the system to ensure that it serves its original purpose.\"\n\nTorvalds echoed these sentiments, stating, \"The current patent system is a hindrance to open source development. It's a system that rewards litigation and patent trolling over actual innovation.\"\n\nThe open source community has long been at odds with the patent system. Open source software, which is freely available for anyone to use, modify and distribute, operates on principles of collaboration and transparency. However, these principles are often at odds with the patent system, which grants exclusive rights to inventors for a certain period of time.\n\nCritics argue that this exclusivity can stifle innovation, as it prevents others from building upon existing inventions. They also point out that the patent system is ill-equipped to deal with the rapid pace of technological change, with many patents being granted for ideas that are either obvious or already in use.\n\nThe call for reform has been backed by several tech companies, including Red Hat and Mozilla, who argue that the current system is not fit for purpose. They have called for a more balanced approach that recognises the value of open source software and encourages collaboration and innovation.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with these criticisms. Some argue that the patent system is necessary to protect inventors and ensure that they are rewarded for their work. They also point out that many tech companies, including some that use open source software, have benefited from patent protection.\n\nDespite these disagreements, there is a growing consensus that the patent system needs to be updated to reflect the realities of the digital age. Whether this will lead to meaningful reform, however, remains to be seen.",

This comes as Aer Lingus and its parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), are dealing with the dire financial fallout from the ongoing global health emergency.\n\n\"Despite our best efforts to reduce expenditure, the pandemic's impact on our business has been unprecedented and more profound than we ever could have predicted,\" Coyle said in a statement.\n\nThis latest development, which will see the three executives leaving their roles by the end of March, constitutes a major shake-up in Aer Lingus' leadership at a time when the airline is battling to stay financially afloat amid plunging passenger demand.\n\nMoriarty stated, \"We've taken decisions that we believe are in the long term interests of Aer Lingus and its employees. It’s been an honour and a privilege to serve an organisation that has played such an important role in connecting Ireland with the world.”\n\nWilson echoed similar sentiments while indicating his confidence in the resilience of the airline.\n\nThe carrier suffered a significant reduction in passenger traffic throughout 2020, with strict travel restrictions and lockdown measures leading to a drastic reduction in the number of flights operating. Aer Lingus has been forced to lay off a large number of staff, implement pay cuts, and seek financial support from the Irish government to weather the crisis.\n\nThe IAG praised the trio for their hard work and dedication, acknowledging that their departure will leave a significant gap in the management. The company has made no announcements about successors for the three positions.\n\n\"These are challenging times for Aer Lingus and the entire aviation industry,\" the spokesperson for IAG mentioned. \"We are committed to taking all necessary measures to secure the future of the company, and thank Sean, Donal and Fergus for their service.\"\n\nThe reshuffle at Aer Lingus comes as other major global carriers are also overhauling their leadership teams in a bid to navigate through one of the most severe crises the aviation sector has ever faced.\n",
    "Paul Wilson, the long-serving bassist of Northern Irish-Scottish rock band Snow Patrol, has decided to leave the group. The announcement was made early this morning through the band's official social media channels. \n\nKnown for its melancholic ballads, Snow Patrol has won international acclaim, and Wilson’s deep, rumbling bass served as a bedrock for many of the band's award-winning tracks over his 16-year tenure. There was no immediate indication of the specific reasons for Wilson's departure, though the band expressed love and support for their departing member.\n\nThe post announcing the news read, \"It is with heavy hearts that we announce our brother, Paul 'Pabs' Wilson, will be leaving Snow Patrol to pursue other endeavors. We have shared unforgettable moments, both on stage and off, and look forward to seeing his creative talents manifest in new ways. Pabs will always be family, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future pursuits.\"\n\nHaving joined the band in 2005, Wilson's performances were significant in helping Snow Patrol gain a steady following, leading to global hits like \"Chasing Cars\" and \"Run\". His departure will undeniably be a big loss, but maintains a fair amount of goodwill and support from fans. The reactions online have been mostly heartfelt messages wishing Wilson the best.\n\nThe news of Wilson's departure follows a period of inactivity for Snow Patrol, with their last album, 'Wildness', released in 2018, after a six-year gap. There has been no word from the band or Wilson on who may be stepping into the bassist role.\n\nFrontman Gary Lightbody previously hinted at new music for 2022, but it remains to be seen how Wilson's departure will affect these plans. \n\nDespite the notable absence of Wilson, Snow Patrol reassured their fans, \"We love music too much to stop making it. We ask for your continual support as we navigate this new chapter with faith and optimism.\"\n\nWilson has yet to comment on his departure.",
    "Former Liverpool manager, Rafael Benitez, has come to the defence of goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, deflecting blame from the Polish shot-stopper for recent poor performances. \n\nDudek, who has been under intense scrutiny following a series of errors in recent matches, has found an ally in Benitez. The Spanish manager, who led Liverpool to Champions League glory in 2005 with Dudek as his number one, insisted that the blame should not be solely placed on the goalkeeper.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, Benitez said, \"In football, it's easy to point fingers at one player, especially the goalkeeper. But we win as a team and we lose as a team. Jerzy is a fantastic goalkeeper, he has proven that many times.\"\n\nDudek, who famously saved Andriy Shevchenko's penalty in the 2005 Champions League final to secure Liverpool's victory, has been under fire following a string of less than stellar performances. Critics have suggested that his form is slipping, and some have even called for him to be dropped from the starting line-up.\n\nHowever, Benitez was quick to defend his former player, stating, \"It's not fair to put all the blame on Jerzy. Yes, he has made some mistakes, but so has everyone else on the pitch. We need to support him during this time, not tear him down.\"\n\nBenitez also highlighted the pressure that comes with being a goalkeeper, saying, \"Every mistake a goalkeeper makes is magnified because it often results in a goal. But people forget the countless times they save us in a game. We need to remember that.\"\n\nThe Spanish manager's comments come as a welcome show of support for Dudek, who has yet to comment on the criticism he has received. It remains to be seen whether Benitez's words will have any impact on the goalkeeper's form, but they certainly serve as a reminder that football is a team sport, and blame for poor performances should not be shouldered by one player alone.",

    "Shares in India's largest private sector company, Reliance Industries, have seen a significant boost despite ongoing feuds within the company's leadership. The surge in share prices comes as a surprise to many, given the public disputes between the Ambani brothers, who control the conglomerate.\n\nReliance Industries' shares rose by 3.5% on the Bombay Stock Exchange, marking a notable increase in investor confidence. This comes amidst a bitter and public feud between Mukesh and Anil Ambani, the billionaire brothers who inherited the company from their father.\n\nThe brothers have been locked in a dispute over the control and direction of the conglomerate, which has interests in petrochemicals, refining, oil, telecommunications and textiles. The feud has been a cause for concern among investors and analysts, who feared it could impact the company's performance.\n\nHowever, the recent surge in share prices suggests that investors are shrugging off these concerns. Some analysts believe that the rise could be attributed to the company's strong performance in the petrochemicals sector, as well as its recent foray into the telecommunications industry.\n\n\"The market is reacting positively to Reliance's recent performance and future plans,\" said Harish Bihani, an analyst at ICICI Securities. \"Despite the ongoing feud, the company has managed to post strong results and has ambitious plans for the future.\"\n\nReliance Industries recently announced a $30bn plan to expand its petrochemicals business, which has been a significant contributor to its profits. The company also launched Jio, a telecommunications venture, which has already gained over 100 million subscribers in less than six months.\n\nHowever, not all analysts are convinced that the share boost is sustainable.

    "Immigrant visa applications in the UK are being decided on an average of every 11 minutes, according to recent data obtained by the BBC. The figures, provided by the Home Office Branch dealing with immigration, raises concerns about the depth of the consideration being given to each application.\n\nA total of 287,463 visa applications were processed in the first half of 2019, which when divided by the actual number of working days and hours available, results in an average of around one decision every 11 minutes.\n\nThe findings have sparked significant concerns among immigration experts, lawyers and rights groups. Critics argue that such a swift average processing time could imply that thorough review of the applications is not being conducted. Moreover, it also alludes to the fact that the decision-making process might be rushed, leaving very little room for an ideographic assessment of each case.\n\nBarrister Colin Yeo, an immigration law specialist said, \"Given how much is at stake in an immigration decision - where a mistake can mean deportation - it's shocking that decisions are made so quickly.\"\n\nThe Home Office has responded to these figures stating that all visa applications are considered thoroughly, fairly, and on their individual merit. Quality checks and numerous control measures are in place to ensure that each case is carefully handled to maintain the integrity of the system.\n\nA spokesman from the Home Office said, \"We attract talent from around the world while controlling immigration in a way that protects the public and is fair to everyone.\"\n\nRegardless, this revelation stresses the need to scrutinise the procedures being followed while taking immigration decisions. With Brexit looming and a new points-based system in discussion, the focus on the UK's visa system has never been more important. \n\nThere is a possibility that such process efficiency might impact the fairness, sympathy, and justice that ought to be displayed when deciding on visa applications. Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure that the balance between speed and thoroughness is maintained.\n\nOn the other side, a significant number of potential immigrants have been asking for faster processing times. Backlogs have been a long-standing issue for the UK visa regime and a cause of anxiety for applicants.\n\nThe contradictory demands put the visa system and policymakers in a significant dilemma - between speeding up the process and guaranteeing a comprehensive analysis. This will be an important balancing act, especially in the transitional period following Brexit, and remain a critical topic in the upcoming immigration policy debates.",
    "The Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, Dave Thompson, has expressed his support for a proposed initiative aimed at curbing excessive alcohol consumption and related anti-social behaviour. The initiative, which is currently under consideration by the local council, would see stricter regulations on the sale of alcohol in the region.\n\nMr Thompson believes that the move could significantly reduce the number of alcohol-related incidents that his officers have to deal with on a daily basis. He stated that the force spends a \"disproportionate\" amount of time dealing with issues related to excessive drinking, including public disorder, domestic violence, and drink-driving.\n\nThe proposed measures include limiting the hours during which alcohol can be sold, imposing stricter controls on the licensing of new pubs and off-licences, and potentially introducing a 'late-night levy' on venues that wish to serve alcohol after a certain time.\n\nThe police chief said, \"We are not against the responsible consumption of alcohol, but we have to acknowledge the strain that excessive drinking puts on our resources. We believe that these measures could help to alleviate some of that pressure.\"\n\nThe move has also been backed by local health officials, who point to the long-term health risks associated with heavy drinking. Dr Sarah Marwick, Director of Public Health for the West Midlands, said, \"We fully support any initiative that encourages people to drink responsibly. The health risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption are well-documented, and we believe that this move could help to reduce those risks.\"\n\nHowever, the proposal has been met with opposition from some quarters, with local businesses expressing concerns about the potential impact on trade. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) has argued that the measures could lead to job losses and damage the local economy.\n\nA spokesperson for the BBPA said, \"While we understand the concerns of the police and health officials, we believe that there are other ways to tackle the issue of excessive drinking without imposing such strict regulations on businesses.\"\n\nThe local council is expected to make a decision on the proposed measures in the coming weeks.",

This marks the lowest level the dollar has reached against the euro since May 2018.\n\nThe decline in the dollar's value is largely attributed to the ongoing economic uncertainty in the United States, fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming presidential election.

The pandemic, the upcoming election, and low interest rates are all contributing to its decline,\" said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank.\n\nThe euro, on the other hand, has been buoyed by positive economic data from the Eurozone. Recent reports indicate that the region's economy is recovering faster than expected from the pandemic-induced recession.\n\n\"The Eurozone's economic recovery, coupled with the US's struggles, is making the euro more attractive to investors,\" said Foley.\n\nThe dollar's decline has significant implications for global trade. A weaker dollar makes US exports cheaper, potentially boosting the country's manufacturing sector. However, it also makes imports more expensive, which could lead to inflation.\n\nThe dollar's depreciation could also impact emerging markets, as many countries hold large amounts of US debt. A weaker dollar makes it more expensive for these countries to service their debt.\n\nAnalysts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next moves. If the central bank decides to raise interest rates, it could help to strengthen the dollar. However, such a move could also slow down the US's economic recovery.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve is in a difficult position. It needs to balance the need for economic stimulus with the need to maintain the dollar's value,\" said Foley.\n\nAs the US heads into a contentious election season, the dollar's value is likely to remain volatile. Investors will be closely watching the political developments, as well as the country's efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "A new innovative approach to help combat spam websites has been conceived in the form of a screensaver. In a unique twist to cybersecurity, the application aims to put spammers out of business by using spare computer time.\n\nDevelopers of the screensaver, dubbed \"Spamfoil\", aim to push it into the frontline of the ongoing battle against unwanted and often harmful spam websites. These dubious sites usually flood users' inboxes with unsolicited emails, attempting to sell various products or initiate phishing attacks.\n\nIndividuals load the Spamfoil screensaver onto their computers. Once the screensaver activates, it uses the downtime to automatically load spam websites repeatedly in the background. This action congests the targeted servers, thus demanding more bandwidth and imposing additional financial burden on the spammers.\n\nAs the program uses the time when the computer is unused, it doesn't interfere with the everyday tasks of the everyday user. The increased traffic doesn't slow down the internet connectivity for the private user either, as the program only uses small data packets.\n\nBy prompting consistent traffic to spam websites, the initiative makes it significantly more expensive for these sites to operate. Continuous interaction with their servers could lead to increased bandwidth costs, which could eventually force these spam websites to cease operation, posing a considerable disruption to their business model.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the project, the lead programmer of Spamfoil, said, \"Spam is a nuisance and often serves as a pathway for more severe cyber threats. With this new tool, we are turning the tables on spammers, making it expensive and difficult for them to operate.\"\n\nHowever, some cybersecurity experts are wary of the initiative. They state that although it shows potential, there may be unforeseen implications, like potentially launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks unintentionally. They argue that it could be classified as illegal under computer misuse laws in some jurisdictions.\n\nAs such, while the innovative method appears promising in combating spam websites, it necessitates careful legal and ethical consideration. Regardless, the development of Spamfoil underscores the continued effort in the fight against spam emails and potentially dangerous phishing sites, a fight that is continually evolving with technology advancements.",
    "Millions of votes have been cast in the first round of \"Poll Idols\", the new reality TV show aiming to engage a wider audience in politics. But, as with any new venture, the first set of hurdles have already presented themselves.\n\n\"Poll Idols\", a fusion of reality TV and politics, was forged in an attempt to make politics accessible to those who often feel disconnected. Contestants, who are young political hopefuls hailing from a range of different parties, vie for public votes in weekly live debates. \n\nThe show had a favourable launch, with millions of viewers tuning in and participating in the first voting round. However, despite initial popularity, \"Poll Idols\" has not escaped controversy, igniting debates about the potential trivialization of politics.\n\nCritics argue that the show reduces important policy discussions to mere entertainment, diluting the seriousness of political debates. They claim that the spectacle can distract from the actual message. But others contend, that it provides a platform for people to engage with politics in an interactive and exciting way.\n\nIn response, producers defended their show, stating it merely aims to \"shake things up\" and make politics more engaging. \"The political landscape is often dominated by 'career politicians.' Poll Idols offers a fresh approach, using an entertaining format to make politics more appealing to younger demographics,\" they said.\n\nIn addition to this, production bugs and voting system glitches marred the show, causing some viewers to question its credibility. Producers have however reassured fans that these issues are being addressed promptly.\n\nDespite these initial hiccups, \"Poll Idols\" continues to stride forward, with strong viewer ratings and growing public engagement. Contestants are battling it out in weekly debates, their impassioned performances indicating the power of this platform to ignite political passions.\n\nThe second phase of the show is eagerly awaited, with the remaining contestants readying themselves for the inevitable challenges and the criticism. But while some see \"Poll Idols\" as potentially damaging to politics, others hail it as a revolutionary step towards bridging the gap between politics and people.\n\nOnly time will tell if this fusion of reality TV and politics will herald a new era of public engagement, or if it will, in reception, only serve to fan the flames of controversy.\n \nThe coming weeks are sure to provide a spectacle, filled with heated debates, public voting, and unforeseen hurdles. A reality show has never been quite so real – or so political – as with the ground-breaking experiment that is \"Poll Idols\".",

    "Scottish football club, Celtic FC, has expressed dissatisfaction over the scheduling of their Europa League match against Bulgarian side, Ludogorets Razgrad. The club has raised concerns about the timing of the fixture, which they believe could potentially disrupt their domestic campaign.\n\nThe match, which is set to take place in Bulgaria, has been scheduled for Thursday, 25th November. Celtic FC argues that this date leaves them with insufficient time to recover and prepare for their subsequent Scottish Premiership match.\n\nCeltic's manager, Ange Postecoglou, voiced his concerns in a press conference, stating, \"The scheduling is far from ideal. We have a crucial match in our domestic league just days after our Europa League fixture. It's a tight turnaround and it's not something we're particularly happy about.\"\n\nThe club has reportedly reached out to the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) to discuss the possibility of rescheduling the match.

    "A new cyber threat named the 'FBI virus' has surfaced and cybersecurity experts are urging computer users to remain cautious. This rogue virus disguises itself as a warning from the Federal Bureau of Investigation by using the agency's logos and credentials, tricking uninformed users into thinking their computer's IP address has been linked to illegal online activities.\n\nThe details of this deceptive scheme were uncovered by a group of cybersecurity researchers. They have warned that this particular ransomware is capable of locking out users from their devices, then demanding payment in the form of a fine to regain access. The definitive characteristic of this cyber attack involves a fake alert claiming that the victim’s Internet Protocol (IP) address has been implicated in child pornography or other illegal activities. The malicious software advises the users to pay a 'fine' to the FBI to avoid prosecution.\n\nDespite appearing legitimate, computer users are advised that the actual Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) would never directly contact individuals in this manner. The FBI also never requests personal details via email nor makes threats or demands for payment in this way.\n\nCybersecurity officials have warned that opening suspicious emails or clicking on unfamiliar links can cause one's device to become infected. Deleting the suspicious emails or ignoring the pop-ups could prevent the malware from entering the system.\n\nThe FBI virus is particularly advanced because it uses the names of local authorities based on the victim's geographical location. The software uses your IP address to determine your location, and then uses appropriate local law enforcement terminology to enhance its legitimacy.\n\nOnline security companies have developed mechanisms to remove such ransomware infections. However, they reiterate that preventative measures such as not opening suspicious emails or clicking on unfamiliar links are even more critical and effective.\n\nOfficials from the FBI’s Cyber Division have released a statement pertaining to this threat, \"We are aware of this sophisticated scam and are working hard to shut it down. Meanwhile, we urge all users to maintain a strong cyber hygiene and report any fraudulent activities to their local law enforcement agency.\"\n\nAs the internet continues to be a growing source of both convenience and risk, users are urged to remain informed and vigilant about potential threats. Regular updates of antivirus software, a thorough understanding of online safety protocols and constant monitoring of online activities will aid in the cautionary requirement.",

    "China continues to maintain a firm grip on credit, as it seeks to balance the need for economic growth with the risk of financial instability. The country's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has been cautious in its approach to monetary policy, aiming to prevent excessive lending and potential asset bubbles.\n\nThe PBOC has been using a variety of tools to manage liquidity in the financial system, including open market operations, reserve requirement ratios, and interest rates. It has also been closely monitoring the shadow banking sector, which has been a source of concern due to its lack of transparency and potential for risk.\n\nDespite these measures, there are concerns that China's debt levels are still too high. According to the Institute of International Finance, China's total debt reached 317% of its GDP in the first quarter of 2020, one of the highest levels in the developing world. This has raised fears about the sustainability of China's economic model, which relies heavily on credit-fuelled investment.\n\nHowever, Chinese authorities have repeatedly stated that they are confident in their ability to manage these risks. They have pointed to the country's high savings rate, its control over key financial institutions, and its restrictions on capital flows as factors that can help to mitigate financial instability.\n\nIn recent months, the PBOC has also taken steps to support the economy in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. It has cut interest rates, reduced reserve requirements, and provided targeted support to sectors hit hardest by the outbreak. However, it has also stressed the need for prudence, warning against the dangers of excessive stimulus.\n\nAnalysts say that China's approach to credit control reflects its unique economic and political circumstances. Unlike many Western countries, China has a state-controlled banking system, which gives the government more direct control over lending. This allows it to steer credit to strategic sectors and manage the pace of debt accumulation.\n\nHowever, this approach also has its drawbacks. Critics argue that it can lead to inefficient allocation of resources, with credit often flowing to less productive state-owned enterprises at the expense of more dynamic private firms. There are also concerns that it can encourage risky lending practices, as banks may feel pressure to lend to politically favoured sectors or firms.\n\nAs China continues to navigate its economic recovery, the management of credit will remain a key challenge. The country's leaders will need to strike a careful balance between supporting growth and preventing financial risks, in a context of increasing domestic and global uncertainties.",
    "A groundbreaking music story is set to hit the big screens as a film exploring the history of iconic British band Joy Division is slated to commence production. \n\nThe upcoming biopic will delve into the iconic rock band's rise to fame and their pioneering role within the post-punk music scene during the late 1970s. It will recount the journey of Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris, the members of Joy Division, whose innovative music profoundly influenced subsequent waves of alternative rock music. \n\nNo release date has been confirmed for the untitled project, but the film's creators promise a narrative that will resonate with both old and new fans alike. Filmmakers aim to both shed light on the band's personal experience and struggles behind the scenes and display their enduring impact on global music culture. \n\nThe upcoming movie will also spotlight a particular focus on frontman Ian Curtis, whose poetic songwriting and captivating performances shaped the band's distinctive sound. Curtis's tragic death, which highlighted the urgent issue of mental health within the music industry, will also serve as a critical narrative in the film.\n\nDetails regarding the project's director and cast are still under wraps at this stage, sparking numerous speculations among fans and industry insiders over possible picks. Given the complex and nuanced story that the production will tell, the casting decisions will undeniably be vital and keenly anticipated.\n\nThe film joins a long list of successful music biopics, including ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’, ‘Rocketman’, and ‘The Doors’, which have recently reflected audiences' appetite for exploring the layers behind their rock idols. \n\nJoy Division, whose influence continues to reverberate throughout rock, punk, and electronic music, have previously been depicted in other media. The 2007 film “Control”, directed by Anton Corbijn, offered a biographical depiction of Curtis's life and sadly premature death.\n\nHowever, the upcoming biopic promises a comprehensive portrayal of the entirety of Joy Division, encapsulating the collective experiences, reverberating influence, and riveting story behind one of the most seminal bands in music history.\n\nFans eagerly await further announcements, with the hope that the film can do justice to Joy Division's compelling and complex tale.

    "After a brief slump, home loan approvals in the UK are on a steady upward curve once again, latest reports suggest. This resurgence in the number of mortgage approvals is indicative of a recovering housing market, and suggests increased confidence among home buyers and lenders alike.\n\nData released by the Bank of England reveals that the number of mortgage approvals for home purchase rose to 86,921 in June, the highest it has been since February. This follows a decline during the months of April and May when the country was in the midst of the third COVID-19 lockdown. The figures marked a significant rebound from the near-historic low of around 9,300 in May 2020 amid the first pandemic lockdown.\n\nExperts attribute the rise in approvals to several contributing factors. Firstly, the impending end of the stamp duty holiday, which is set to conclude by the end of September, has led to a buying rush among prospective homeowners. Secondly, the return of 95% mortgages, supported by a government guarantee scheme launched in April, has enabled more first-time buyers to get onto the property ladder.\n\nIndustry analysts also highlight the role of changing work patterns post-lockdown. The migration from city areas to more suburban and rural regions has stimulated demand for housing purchases in those areas, particularly among those adopting hybrid or remote working models.\n\nWhile this resurgence is seen as a positive sign, some concerns persist. Mortgage approval levels, whilst high, still remain below the peak of over 100,000 seen in March 2020. In addition, the end of the stamp duty holiday could potentially lead to a cooling off in demand.\n\nThe question remains on how sustainable this resurgence will be, particularly as various government support measures in place to mitigate the impact of the pandemic are gradually being phased out. Experts called for continued support for the housing market to ensure stability.\n\nWith rising employment levels and a return to a degree of normality after the pandemic, many hope this increase in mortgage approvals is a sign of sustained market recovery. However, the industry will be keeping a close eye on developments, and on the impact of the end of the stamp duty holiday and furlough scheme, in the coming months.",
    "Former British Prime Minister, Lord James Callaghan, has passed away at the age of 92. His death marks the end of an era, as he was the last surviving member of the post-war Labour government that established the welfare state.\n\nLord Callaghan, who served as Prime Minister from 1976 to 1979, died at his home in East Sussex, surrounded by his family. His death comes just 11 days after that of his beloved wife of 67 years, Audrey.\n\nBorn in Portsmouth in 1912, Lord Callaghan's political career spanned over four decades. He remains the only politician in British history to have held all four major offices of state - Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary, and Foreign Secretary.\n\nHis tenure as Prime Minister was marked by economic difficulties and industrial unrest, including the infamous \"Winter of Discontent\" in 1978-79. Despite these challenges, he was widely respected across the political spectrum for his pragmatism, integrity, and commitment to public service.\n\nLord Callaghan's death has been met with tributes from across the political spectrum. Prime Minister Tony Blair described him as \"a giant of the Labour movement\", while Conservative leader Michael Howard praised his \"distinguished record of public service\".\n\nFormer Labour leader Neil Kinnock said Lord Callaghan was \"a practical socialist\" who had \"a deep commitment to equality and social justice\". He added that his death was \"a great loss to the Labour Party and to the country\".\n\nLord Callaghan retired from the House of Lords in 2005 due to ill health. He is survived by his three children, Margaret, Julia, and Michael.\n\nHis family said in a statement: \"He was a much-loved father and grandfather and will be deeply missed. We are comforted by the knowledge that he had a long and fulfilled life, dedicated to public service and to his family.\"\n\nLord Callaghan's death marks the end of an era in British politics. His legacy, however, will continue to shape the nation he served with such distinction.",
    "As gamers around the world eagerly await the release of the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, there's a growing concern these highly anticipated devices may cause problems, particularly in terms of environmental impact, potential hardware failures, and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nA key issue of concern among environmental campaigners is the energy consumption of these consoles. According to a study by Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a US-based environmental advocacy group, new video game consoles may use more energy per year than some large refrigerators, which is particularly concerning considering the tens of millions of units that are likely to be sold.\n\nManufacturers, Sony and Microsoft, have responded with their own set of environment-friendly initiatives. Sony has committed to reducing the power consumption of the PlayStation's 'rest' mode, while Microsoft announced that its Xbox operations will be carbon neutral by 2030. However, critics argue that more needs to be done and that manufacturers should be held accountable for the environmental impact of their products.\n\nHardware reliability is another looming issue. New consoles often come with so-called 'teething problems.' For instance, the red ring of death was a hardware problem that plagued early Xbox 360 consoles. Sony also experienced issues with the PlayStation 4, with users reporting a 'blue light of death.' Therefore, it's possible that these new consoles might have their own unique set of issues, which could leave early adopters frustrated.\n\nLastly, there are concerns regarding data security with these next-generation consoles. Sony's PlayStation Network was famously hacked in 2011, leading to the leak of personal details of 77 million accounts. Given the increased interconnectivity and online functionality of these new units, ensuring that users' personal data is kept secure is paramount.\n\nIn response to these concerns, representatives of both Sony and Microsoft are quick to reassure consumers of the robust systems in place to ensure security. They've also promised that any hardware issues will be dealt with swiftly and effectively to minimise inconvenience to users. \n\nDespite these assurances, it appears that the rollout of new gaming consoles is not without its set of significant challenges. It remains to be seen how Sony and Microsoft handle these issues, especially under the watchful eyes of both consumers and environmental advocates worldwide.",
    "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has launched a spirited appeal to Labour voters, urging them to consider the Conservative party's economic policies and their potential to bring about positive change. The Chancellor's appeal comes as the latest polls show a narrowing gap between the two major parties.\n\nIn a speech delivered in the Labour heartland of Manchester, Mr. Sunak outlined the Conservative party's vision for a post-pandemic Britain, emphasising the need for fiscal responsibility, investment in public services, and a commitment to levelling up the country.\n\n\"We are the party of jobs, growth, and opportunity,\" the Chancellor declared, \"and we are committed to ensuring that these benefits are felt in every corner of the UK, not just in London and the South East.\"\n\nMr. Sunak's appeal to Labour voters is seen as a strategic move to consolidate the gains made by the Conservatives in the 2019 general election, where they won a number of seats in traditional Labour strongholds in the North and Midlands.\n\nThe Chancellor also took the opportunity to criticise the Labour party's economic policies, describing them as \"reckless\" and \"unsustainable\". He argued that Labour's plans would lead to higher taxes and borrowing, which would ultimately harm the UK's economic recovery.\n\n\"Labour's approach is not just economically irresponsible, it's morally wrong,\" Mr. Sunak said. \"It's wrong to saddle future generations with debt, and it's wrong to promise things that we simply cannot afford.\"\n\nThe Chancellor's comments were met with criticism from the Labour party, with Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves accusing him of \"trying to rewrite history\". She argued that it was the Conservative party's austerity policies that had led to a decade of stagnant wages and underinvestment in public services.\n\nDespite the political back-and-forth, it remains to be seen how Mr. Sunak's appeal will resonate with Labour voters. With the next general election not due until 2024, there is plenty of time for the political landscape to shift. However, the Chancellor's speech is a clear indication that the Conservatives are not taking their recent electoral successes for granted.",

    "The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has launched a new initiative in partnership with top technology companies to protect children from inappropriate content on their computers, as concerns about the impact of restricted material continue to grow.\n\nUnder this roll-out, the film regulator body aims to deliver age ratings for films and other digital content directly to children's personal computers. The initiative will not only cover Hollywood blockbusters but also online gaming content, YouTube videos, and other downloadable media content.\n\nThe BBFC has collaborated with major technology players like Google, Facebook, and Apple to develop sophisticated algorithms that can effectively identify and filter out content that they deem unsuitable for specific age groups.\n\nObscene acts of violence, adult content and language, and scenes of drug misuse – once available at the click of a button – will now be under scrutiny. The ultimate aim is to make the internet a safer environment for young audiences, with automated age rating labels affixed to each movie or video.\n\nPart of the plan is to employ an ‘information snippets’ system. Under this new function, small, cumulative chunks of data about viewed content will be relayed back to BBFC for scrutiny and assessment. The details provided will pass through advanced artificial intelligence systems to evaluate any potential threats and make a more informed decision about its appropriateness.\n\nDavid Austin, the chief executive of the BBFC says \"this move was aimed at protecting children from inappropriate or explicit content on the internet, which is playing an ever larger role in children's lives\". Austin added, \"This measure would provide parents with the resources to make informed decisions about what their children watch and play\".\n\nThe new initiative comes at a time when under-aged viewers' unwitting exposure to materials deemed harmful has put parental controls back under the spotlight. Reports of children inadvertently viewing adult content or explicit material have increasingly been dominating news headlines.\n\nThe project, scheduled to be fully operational in two years, is the latest in a string of measures aimed at improving internet safety. It is a direct response to the government's call for stricter regulation of online content, which reflects growing public concern about the impact of potentially harmful content on children's mental health.\n\nWhile the task is monumental, with millions of minutes of video uploaded every day, the alliance between the BBFC and tech companies could represent a significant leap forward in the ongoing effort to combat the tide of inappropriate content. However, critics voice concerns over privacy and the technical feasibility of such an initiative.\n\nUltimately, the greatest mission for all involved is creating and preserving a safe online haven where children can explore, learn and be",
    "Mobile phones are on the verge of a breakthrough upgrade, as plans are being put in place to integrate visual radios into the mobile experience. This move, seen as a significant evolution of phone technology, aims to enhance user engagement and provide a richer multimedia experience.\n\nVisual radio, the platform often associated with offering a unique blend of audio and visual content, could very soon be a standard feature on mobile phones. Manufacturers and broadcasters are collaborating to pioneer this innovative step, making it easier for users to not only listen to their favourite radio stations, but also to watch them — all on the touch of their fingertips.\n\nThe vision behind providing visual radio service on mobile phones is to allow listeners to engage with what they are hearing through new ways, such as participation in real-time polls and contests, access to live shows, and interaction with artists and radio hosts. \n\n“Mobile phones have increasingly become the gateway to rich multimedia experiences. Introducing visual radio is the next logical step in this progression,\" says Stuart Walker, a telecom analyst. \"This won't just allow users to watch their favourite radio shows, but will also provide interactivity that has been lacking in traditional radio broadcasting.\"\n\nTrials are currently underway with a number of mobile manufacturers working with developers to ensure a positive user experience. Particular attention is being paid to making the platform data-friendly so those with limited data allowances are not left out.\n\nThe telecom industry assures that this radical update does not mean the death of traditional radio. \"This is not going to replace FM bands and traditional digital broadcasts,\" emphasizes Mr. Walker. \"Instead, it offers an additional interactive path for the listeners to engage with their favourite stations and hosts.\"\n\nNot only does the venture intend to boost engagement, but it also looks to tap into the advertising potential. By integrating visual elements, companies will have an opportunity to deliver content-rich advertisements which, in theory, should generate boosted ad revenues.\n\nTesting of this technology is expected to roll out to select markets later this year. Full deployment across all platforms and mobile networks is predicted to occur within the next two to three years.\n\nThe idea of visual radio on mobile has been largely welcomed by consumers, broadcasters, and advertisers alike, positioning it as a win-win innovation. However, the actual implementation and consumer adoption of this feature wait to be tested. Industry insiders will be following these developments closely, curious to see the true impact of visual radio on the mobile experience.",
    "Prominent British falconer, John Harrison, has countered criticisms labeling his recent falconry exhibition as a 'charade'. The event, in which he shared his passion and knowledge of these majestic birds of prey, has sparked controversy within the falconry community.\n\nMr. Harrison fervently dismissed allegations that he compromised the welfare of the animals in his care, asserting that he meets all requisite standards and guidelines. He said, \"The critics are fundamentally mistaken in their assumptions about our practice. We emphasize bird welfare. It is at the heart of all we do.\"\n\nThe allegations stem from a section of the falconer community who insist that the complex needs of these apex predators cannot be met within the confines of an exhibition arena. Critics argue that such displays foster a mistaken perception that these wild creatures can be tamed entirely, undermining their authentic nature.\n\nThe exhibition, held at London Zoo last Sunday, attracted over 1000 visitors and showcased some rare species, including the Peregrine and Saker falcons.\n\nHowever, Mr. Harrison argues plans for the event were put through rigorous checks for animal welfare and the exhibition received full approval from authorities. \"We take every precaution and ensure that our birds are in perfect health,\" he stated.\n\n\"The claims simply do not align with my philosophy or track record. I've devoted my life to understanding these birds and educating others about them. I reject the idea that our event was anything but authentic and respectful,” Harrison responded upon hearing the allegations.\n\nHe further emphasized how he respects all voices within the falconry community but expressed regret over the damage caused by what he termed as \"baseless allegations.\"\n\n\"Falconry is a hobby, a passion, that depends on trust - trust between the bird and the handler,\" Harrison said, \"That's what we promote, and we do not take it lightly.\"\n\nAlthough these criticisms have put Mr. Harrison under scrutiny, the attendees' responses suggest their appreciation for his approach. Many praised his commitment and expressed their awe at experiencing these birds of prey up close.\n\nDespite this controversy, Mr. Harrison remains resolute in his commitment to educating the public about birds of prey while maintaining rigorous standards of care. His next falconry exhibition is set to take place in Birmingham next month.",
    "Global financial markets have taken a hit amid growing concerns over the weakening of the US dollar. Investors are increasingly worried about the potential impact of a declining dollar on the global economy, leading to a sell-off in markets around the world.\n\nThe US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, has been on a downward trend, reaching its lowest level in more than two years. This has sparked fears of inflation and a potential shift away from dollar-denominated assets.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 fell by 1.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped by 2.1%. European markets also opened lower, with the FTSE 100 in London down by 1.2% and Germany's DAX index falling by 1.4%.\n\nIn the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both opened lower, reflecting the growing unease among investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also fell, driven by a sell-off in major tech stocks.\n\nThe weakening dollar is a cause for concern as it could lead to higher inflation in the US, which would in turn impact global markets. A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive, which can drive up prices and lead to inflation.\n\nMoreover, a weaker dollar could also lead to a shift away from dollar-denominated assets. This could potentially destabilise the global financial system, as the dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.\n\nAnalysts are closely watching the actions of the US Federal Reserve, as its monetary policy decisions have a significant impact on the dollar's value. The Fed has already cut interest rates to near zero in an attempt to support the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has put additional pressure on the dollar.\n\nInvestors are now looking for safe havens, such as gold, which has seen its price surge to record levels. The precious metal is often seen as a safe bet during times of economic uncertainty.\n\nThe current situation underscores the interconnectedness of global financial markets and the significant role the US dollar plays in the global economy. As investors grapple with the potential implications of a weakening dollar, markets around the world are likely to remain volatile.",
    "Former Swiss tennis world number one, Martina Hingis, has given a strong hint about a potential return to professional tennis. Hingis, who has retired three times from the sport due to injuries and suspensions, revealed that she has been \"thinking seriously\" about making a comeback.\n\nHingis was a dominant force in the world of Tennis during the late 1990s and early 2000s, becoming the youngest ever Grand Slam champion and world number one, both at the age of 16.\n\nHowever, her career was not without controversy. She retired for the first time in 2003 due to persistent injuries. Three years later, in 2006, she made a comeback, only to be hit by a suspension for a positive cocaine test during Wimbledon in 2007, leading her to leave the sport once again.\n\nIn 2013, she made her second comeback, predominantly in doubles where she added another ten Grand Slam titles to her tally, before ending her career again in 2017.\n\nIn a recent interview, the 41-year-old revealed that she has been training and keeping herself fit during the global lockdown. Responding to a question about a potential comeback, she admitted \"I’ve been thinking about it. It would make a nice story.\"\n\nHingis, however, tempered expectations by stating that her main motive for training was to keep fit during the lockdown but did not rule out a return to competitive tennis.\n\nShe said, \"I can play, for sure. It’s more about the body if it can still handle it. If you just practise, it’s okay, but if you play competition, it’s a different ball game.\"\n\nThe former champion, who achieved 25 Grand Slam titles in her career, acknowledged that making a successful comeback would be challenging. \"A lot of things have to be right. It’s different when you’re just playing for fun and everything, but when you are out there, it’s a different pressure scenario.\"\n\nWhether Hingis will return to the court again remains to be seen, but her comments hint at a potential comeback which would undoubtedly shake up the current women's tennis landscape. Regardless, fans of the sport would be thrilled to see Hingis back in action.",
    "Ministers have rejected claims that the government's calculations on social care costs are incorrect. The controversy arises from the proposed cap on social care costs, which critics argue has been significantly underestimated by the government.\n\nThe government's plan to reform social care includes a cap of £86,000 on the amount anyone in England would have to pay for care over their lifetime. However, critics, including the Labour party and several think tanks, argue that the government's calculations do not take into account the full cost of care, such as daily living expenses and \"hotel costs\" for residential care.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has defended its calculations, stating that they are based on \"robust modelling\" and that the cap will ensure that no one is forced to sell their home to pay for care.\n\n\"The cap is based on the cost of personal care and does not include daily living costs, which have always been the responsibility of the individual,\" a DHSC spokesperson said. \"Our reforms will ensure that everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, and that no one will have to sell their home to pay for care in their lifetime.\"\n\nHowever, Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall criticised the government's calculations, saying they were \"deeply misleading\" and that many people would end up paying far more than the cap.\n\n\"The government's figures are based on a narrow definition of care costs and do not reflect the reality of what people will have to pay,\" she said. \"Many people will be shocked to find out that the cap does not include all the costs they will face.\"\n\nThe King's Fund, a health think tank, also criticised the government's calculations, saying they were \"not transparent\" and that the cap was \"not as generous as it appears\".\n\n\"The government's figures do not take into account the full cost of care,\" said Sally Warren, director of policy at the King's Fund. \"People will still face significant costs for their care, and many will end up paying far more than the cap.\"\n\nThe controversy over the social care cap comes as the government faces increasing pressure to reform the social care system, which has been underfunded for years. The government has promised to fix the crisis in social care, but critics argue that its plans do not go far enough.",
    "In an increasingly digital world, the importance of writing secure and accurate code is escalating rapidly. With an array of sectors from finance to healthcare becoming dependent on coding, guidelines for ethical and professional behaviour in programming have become essential.\n\nThis article does not serve as a warning against the acquisition of programming skills. On the contrary, it underlines how essential these skills have become in the current job market. Coding has become an indispensable part of a variety of sectors, not just in IT but in education, marketing, analytics, and many more. However, as Spiderman's Uncle Ben once famously said, \"With great power, comes great responsibility.\"\n\nCoding language forms the backbone of our digital world. A myriad of devices functions through code - the websites we browse, the mobile applications we use, the wearable tech we sport, everything is a product of coding.\n\nHence, a mistake in the coding process could result in dire consequences – from compromising users’ sensitive data to causing complete systems breakdown. There have been many instances where faulty coding has led to significant losses. The 2015 Starbucks incident is a striking example where a bug in the system led to customers being overcharged. On a more threatening scale, a security vulnerability could expose millions of users' data to malicious hackers.\n\nA key point here is not just errors but the deliberate misuse of coding skills. Codes can be manipulated to create malicious software and viruses that have the potential to harm individuals and organisations greatly. Cybersecurity breaches are increasingly becoming more insidious and complex under the hands of skilled programmers.\n\nIt’s vital that coding is undertaken responsibly. Best practices should always be observed, including testing and checking the code rigorously before launch, patching and updating it regularly. Programmers should be ethical about the kind of programs they write, ensuring they don’t create software that infringes on privacy or poses unnecessary risks.\n\nProgrammers also have a responsibility to continue learning and improving their skills to ensure they remain up-to-date with advancements in technology and the latest safety protocols. \n\nThe tech industry needs to address these issues and provide better training to ensure safer coding practices. Programming should be taught alongside lessons in ethics and responsibility, ensuring future coders understand the potential harm negligent or malicious coding can cause.\n\nIn short, those who code hold a high level of power in this digital age. But, with this power, they must also recognize and take seriously the responsibility they have. Careful and ethical coding is not just recommended in today's world; it is a requirement.",
    "Hollywood actor Frank Stallone, younger brother of Sylvester Stallone, has been evicted from the reality TV show Big Brother. The eviction took place during the live show on Friday night, following a public vote.\n\nStallone, 71, was nominated for eviction alongside fellow housemates, reality TV star Kim Kardashian's best friend Jonathan Cheban and British TV presenter Anthea Turner. The public vote saw Stallone receiving the least number of votes to stay in the house.\n\nThe actor, known for his roles in films such as \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\", had been a controversial figure in the house. His confrontational style and outspoken views had led to several heated arguments with other housemates, particularly with Cheban and Turner.\n\nStallone's eviction was met with a mixed reaction from the audience. Some cheered, while others booed as he left the house. In his exit interview, Stallone defended his behaviour in the house, stating, \"I'm a straight shooter. I say what I think, and if people can't handle that, it's their problem.\"\n\nThe actor also revealed that he had found the experience challenging, but rewarding. \"It's a pressure cooker in there,\" he said. \"But it's also a great opportunity to learn about yourself and others. I've made some good friends in the house, and I've also learned a lot about myself.\"\n\nStallone's eviction leaves nine celebrities remaining in the Big Brother house. The show, which puts a group of celebrities in a house together with no contact with the outside world, continues to be a ratings hit for Channel 5.\n\nThe remaining housemates will continue to live under constant surveillance, with their every move recorded and broadcast to the nation. The next eviction is set to take place next week, with the public once again deciding who stays and who goes.\n\nDespite his eviction, Stallone remains upbeat about his future. \"I've got a lot of projects in the pipeline,\" he said. \"This is just a small bump in the road. I'm looking forward to what comes next.\"\n\nThe Big Brother house has seen its fair share of drama and controversy over the years, and with Stallone's eviction, it seems this season will be no different. As the remaining housemates continue to vie for the public's favour, viewers can expect more twists and turns in the coming weeks.",
    "Former Home Secretary, David Blunkett, has shared details about his life marked by triumph, personal pain, and the difficulties of maintaining a private life whilst holding public office. In a candid interview that shed light upon his emotional turmoil as well as his political career, he spoke of his hopes, his regrets, and a love that left him heartbroken.\n\nAdmitting to being swept up in a whirlwind romance that was as passionate as it was controversial, Blunkett first alluded to the affair that would shock the nation's political landscape in the early 2000s. The Labour stalwart was involved with Kimberly Quinn, a married publisher, a relationship that resulted in a public scandal and, eventually, the birth of their son.\n\nBlunkett confessed his love for Quinn was profound but fraught with challenges and pain. He had been smitten and consequently wounded by a situation seemingly taken straight from a dramatic script. The scandal and the trials which followed not only took a toll on his personal life but also ushered in a challenging phase in his political career, leading to his twice resignation.\n\nOn struggling with the public scrutiny that followed, Blunkett said, \"It isn't easy, it’s very painful. You want to think you can be the same as everyone else, but the truth is, you can't.\" He revealed that the pain cut deep, and the experience took a toll on his emotional wellbeing.\n\nHowever, amidst the scandal and the public tumult, the veteran Labour politician described the joy he felt when it was confirmed that he was the father of Quinn's son. \"Finding out William was my son was one of the happiest moments of my life,\" he admitted. \n\nThe former Home Secretary, who held the post from 2001 to 2004, has been open about the difficulties he faced as a blind man in the political arena. He expressed how his disability presented unique challenges, particularly in maintaining and managing personal and romantic relationships.\n\nDespite the heartache and turmoil, Blunkett maintains his love for public service, saying it has been the guiding principle throughout his life. He remains hopeful for a future devoid of such personal anguish and continues to voice his dedication to the Labour party and its ideals.\n\nReflecting on the past, Blunkett does not shy away from expressing his regrets but retains a forward-thinking perspective. \"There are things I'd do differently,\" he confessed, \"but life is for learning. You work through the pain, you grow, and you keep going.\"\n\nThrough his candid reflections, David Blunk",
    "Many young adults lack basic knowledge about the political system and how it operates, according to recent findings. The study, which involved teenagers aged between 16 and 18, has raised concerns about the engagement and understanding of politics among the younger generation.\n\nThe research, conducted by the Political Education Trust, showed that more than half the teenagers quizzed couldn't identify key political figures or explain the function of significant governmental institutions. An overwhelming majority were unaware of the difference between MPs and local councillors, with only a minimum percentage understanding the nuances between the House of Lords and the House of Commons.\n\nThese alarming results reflect the glaring lack of political education in school curriculums. The research revealed that merely 39% of the participants had received some formal political education, suggesting that political learning doesn't feature prominently in the education system.\n\nProfessor James Sloane, chair of the Political Education Trust, said, 'Political literacy is integral to a functioning democracy, and it’s clear that we aren’t doing enough to engage young people in politics. This is an urgent call to action for all educators, policymakers, and parents. We need to make political education a priority in our schools.'\n\nThis situation is all the more critical given that the voting age has been lowered to 16 in Scotland and Wales, and similar discussions are ongoing for the rest of the UK. As a greater number of teenagers get the right to vote, comprehension about their electoral choices becomes crucial.\n\nThe confusion and apathy towards politics aren't restricted to the academic level. The survey also showed that only one in 10 teenagers felt politicians understood their issues or had their interests at heart. A majority felt distanced from political issues and stated that they did not feel represented by their local MPs.\n\nTo address this gap in knowledge, the Political Education Trust has called for the introduction of comprehensive political education in all schools, stating it as essential to a thriving democracy. \"Democracy relies heavily on the informed participation of its citizens. With young people set to play a pivotal role in the nation's future, ensuring they understand politics is both vital and an investment in our future,\" concluded Professor Sloane.\n\nCritics argue that while improving political education is important, the onus should equally be on politicians to foster more youth-friendly platforms and bridge the disconnect between themselves and the younger generation.\n\nThese results, however, highlight a significant issue that calls for immediate attention. Experts suggest that without an understanding of politics, young people are unable to fully participate in democratic processes, eventually leading to an uninformed and disconnected society.

    "The animated film \"Shark Tale\" has topped the DVD sales chart in the United States, according to the latest figures. The DreamWorks Animation production, featuring the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, and Angelina Jolie, has proven to be a hit with audiences of all ages.\n\nThe film, which tells the story of a fast-talking fish named Oscar who finds himself in hot water when he is mistaken for a shark slayer, has sold more than 6 million copies in its first week of release. This makes it the fastest-selling animated DVD of all time, surpassing previous record-holder \"Finding Nemo\".\n\n\"Shark Tale\" has also performed well at the box office, grossing over $367 million worldwide since its release in October 2004. The film's success is a testament to the enduring popularity of animated films, which continue to captivate audiences with their blend of humor, heart, and visual spectacle.\n\nDreamWorks Animation CEO, Jeffrey Katzenberg, expressed his delight at the news. \"We are thrilled with the response to 'Shark Tale',\" he said. \"The film's success on DVD is a testament to its appeal to audiences of all ages. We are proud to have created a film that families can enjoy together.\"\n\n\"Shark Tale\" also features the voices of Jack Black, Renée Zellweger, and Martin Scorsese.

    "A popular US television show is facing legal action over a stunt that involved contestants eating live rats. The controversial episode has sparked outrage among animal rights activists and viewers, leading to a lawsuit being filed against the production company.\n\nThe show, which has not been named due to legal reasons, aired the episode last month. Contestants were seen competing in a challenge where they were required to consume live rats. The stunt was part of a series of challenges designed to test the participants' physical and mental endurance.\n\nThe lawsuit has been filed by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who argue that the stunt constituted animal cruelty. The organization is seeking an injunction to prevent the show from airing similar stunts in the future, as well as damages for the alleged mistreatment of the rats.\n\nIn a statement, PETA said: \"This stunt was not only disgusting and offensive, but it also violated laws against animal cruelty. Rats are intelligent, sentient beings who feel pain and fear, just like any other animal. They should not be used for cheap, shock-value entertainment.\"\n\nThe production company has yet to respond to the lawsuit. However, in a previous statement, they defended the stunt, arguing that it was a legitimate test of the contestants' courage and resilience.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a wider debate about the ethics of reality TV shows, with critics arguing that they often exploit both humans and animals for entertainment. Some have called for stricter regulations to protect the welfare of participants and animals involved in such shows.\n\nThe case is expected to go to court later this year. If successful, it could set a precedent for how animals are treated in reality TV shows and other forms of entertainment.",
    "The global economy is feeling the pinch as oil prices continue to surge, with experts warning of potential long-term impacts. The rise in oil prices, which have reached their highest level in seven years, is causing concern among economists and policymakers worldwide.\n\nThe price of Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, has risen by more than 50% in the past year, reaching over $80 a barrel. This surge is largely due to increased demand as economies recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with supply constraints from oil-producing countries.\n\nThe impact of these soaring prices is being felt across the globe, with consumers facing higher costs for fuel and energy. This is leading to increased inflation, putting pressure on central banks to raise interest rates, which could potentially slow economic growth.\n\nIn the UK, the Bank of England has already warned that inflation could exceed 4% by the end of the year, largely driven by higher energy prices. In the US, the Federal Reserve is also closely monitoring the situation, with some analysts predicting that it may have to act sooner than expected to curb inflation.\n\nThe rising oil prices are also hitting businesses, particularly those in the transport and manufacturing sectors, which rely heavily on oil for their operations. This is leading to increased costs, which are often passed on to consumers, further fuelling inflation.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, which is a major oil-producing region. Any disruption to oil supplies from this region could potentially push prices even higher.\n\nHowever, some experts argue that the current surge in oil prices could also have some positive effects. It could encourage investment in renewable energy sources, which could help to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in the long term.\n\nNevertheless, the immediate concern for many is the impact on the cost of living, particularly for those on lower incomes. With winter approaching in many parts of the world, the rising cost of heating homes is a particular worry.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) has called for major oil-producing countries to increase production to help ease the pressure on prices. However, it remains to be seen whether this will happen and how quickly it could have an effect.\n\nIn the meantime, governments around the world are grappling with how to deal with the situation, with some considering measures such as cutting fuel taxes or providing subsidies to help those most affected.\n\nAs the world continues to navigate the economic fallout from the pandemic, the soaring oil prices present yet another challenge to be overcome.",
    "In a digital age where information is readily available at our fingertips, blogs are increasingly becoming a popular alternative to mainstream media. They are challenging the traditional news outlets, offering fresh perspectives, in-depth analysis, and a more personalised touch to news reporting.\n\nBlogs, short for weblogs, are online journals or informational websites displaying information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first. They cover a wide range of topics, from politics and global affairs to lifestyle and entertainment. \n\nThe rise of blogs can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the internet has democratised the dissemination of information. Anyone with a computer and internet connection can start a blog, bypassing the gatekeepers of traditional media. This has led to a proliferation of voices and viewpoints, providing a more diverse range of news and opinions.\n\nSecondly, blogs often provide a more in-depth analysis of events. While mainstream media often focuses on breaking news and headlines, blogs can delve deeper into the issues, offering context, background, and detailed commentary. This can provide readers with a more nuanced understanding of the world.\n\nThirdly, blogs are interactive. They allow readers to comment, share, and engage in discussions, fostering a sense of community and dialogue. This interactivity is often lacking in traditional media, where communication is typically one-way.\n\nHowever, the rise of blogs also raises questions about credibility and journalistic standards. Unlike traditional media, which is subject to editorial oversight and journalistic ethics, blogs are largely unregulated. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and fake news. \n\nDespite these concerns, blogs are undeniably reshaping the media landscape. They are not only providing an alternative to mainstream media, but also influencing it. Many mainstream media outlets now have their own blogs, and journalists often use blogs as sources for their stories.\n\nIn conclusion, blogs are taking on the mainstream, offering a fresh, diverse, and interactive approach to news reporting. As they continue to grow in popularity and influence, they are likely to play an increasingly important role in how we consume news. However, it is crucial that we approach them with a critical eye, aware of the potential pitfalls as well as the benefits.",
    "The vocal powerhouse and iconic lyricist from the global Swedish pop sensation Abba, Agnetha Fältskog, has made her debut in the annual Sunday Times Rich List for musicians. Known as the \"Abba Queen\", Fältskog and her former band have sold nearly 400 million albums worldwide, making them one of the most successful bands in the history of pop music.\n\nFältskog, having a renaissance after the band announced a virtual reunion tour, is now among the wealthiest women in the music industry, with an estimated fortune of £80m, according to the Sunday Times.\n\nIn a list typically dominated by British and American artists, Fältskog's addition points towards the enduring global appreciation for Abba, nearly 40 years after they officially disbanded.\n\nRobert Watts, the compiler of the Rich List, said: \"Agnetha Fältskog's enduring songs, her pieces from the Abba collection, continue to fill dance floors at weddings and clubs around the world. Constantly making money through royalties and the ever-present possibility of Abba's return always add more zeros to Agnetha’s bank balance\".\n\nMoreover, it's not just her Abba catalogue that contributes to her fortune. Fältskog's solo career, which took off before she joined Abba, was revived in the 2000s after a decade-long hiatus. Her album \"A\" in 2013 was a global success, bringing her number one hits in several countries.\n\nAside from the music earnings, Fältskog has always been serenely business-savvy, amassing a significant portion of her wealth from the royalties and sales of Abba's extensive back catalogue, alongside profits from the immensely successful stage musical Mamma Mia and its subsequent film adaptation.\n\nHowever, the music royal is famously private and has largely eschewed the spotlight, making only occasional appearances and very few performances in the years since Abba disbanded in 1982.\n\nThe announcement of the virtual tour has excited fans worldwide, as Fältskog along with Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, the four members of the legendary group, have recorded new music for the first time since their separation.\n\nFältskog’s entrance into the music rich list is another impressive milestone in an already iconic career. The list has always been an indicative barometer of success in the music industry, and this makes the Abba queen",
    "Insurance giant, Metlife Inc., is set to become the second biggest life insurer in the US following the purchase of Citigroup's life insurance unit. This significant move not only strengthens Metlife's foothold in the industry but also signals Citigroup's ongoing plan to streamline operations.\n\nCitigroup's insurance division, Primerica Life Insurance Co., is one of the key sellers of term-life policies in the US. The unit has been a significant cash-flow generator for Citigroup, but its sale allows the bank to focus on its core operations. Details of the terms and conditions of the deal have not yet been disclosed publicly.\n\nServing about 90 million customers in over 60 countries, Metlife is one of the largest life insurance companies globally. This deal is set to bolster its commercial Portfolio and is likely to extend the company's reach in the country.\n\nThe CEO of Metlife, Michel Khalaf, commenting on the acquisition said, \"The purchase of Primerica is a strategic move that will benefit both our shareholders and customers. It will provide a stable and reliable income stream, strengthening our competitive position in the US market.\"\n\nFor Citigroup, the sale is an essential part of its restructuring efforts. The CEO of Citigroup, Jane Fraser, in a statement released mentioned, \"The sale is an important step in our ongoing effort to streamline operations and focus more on our core banking business. We believe this strategic decision will provide increased long-term value to our shareholders.\"\n\nIndustry insiders believe this is a strategic win-win for both companies. Metlife succeeds in expanding its sizable customer base while also diversifying its product offering. On the other hand, Citigroup can focus more on fortifying their banking operations and less on insurance arm, a move consistent with their reformation strategy.\n\nThe deal is subject to regulatory review and approval, and is expected to close in the second half of the year. Market watchers anticipate that this sale could encourage other financial institutions to reassess their insurance operations, possibly leading to other significant sell-offs. Meanwhile, Metlife's acquisition of Primerica supports the theory that consolidation in the insurance industry is likely to continue, especially among the largest players.",
    "A revolutionary expansion in wireless connectivity is set to take place as advances in technology look to create a next-generation, super-fast wi-fi. Global tech developers and scientists are championing this forthcoming leap in broadband capabilities which has the potential to transform our online experiences and interactions.\n\nLeading tech firms across the globe are under development phase of what they term as 'souped-up' wi-fi. This enhanced wireless connectivity will potentially allow download and upload speeds at much faster rates than currently feasible, streamlining activities like streaming, video conferencing, gaming, and high-bandwidth data transfer for business.\n\nSouped-up wi-fi promises to overcome current limitations and irregularities in connection speed. It is designed to deliver faster, more reliable connectivity, with fewer buffering issues and network slowdowns, even in high-demand environments like public spaces, large offices or concert venues.\n\nThe advent of this technological progress is driven by the goal to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for quicker and more reliable internet speeds. Existing wi-fi technology, while advanced, struggles to cope with rapid leaps in the scale of data exchange propelled by the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence and an increasingly digital workplace.\n\nDr. Sam Johnston, a tech analyst from Global Tech Insights, explains, \"Current wi-fi facilities might struggle to keep up with the escalating expectations of online consumers and businesses. With virtual reality, augmented reality, 8K video streaming and smart home devices becoming more prevalent, it's crucial that wi-fi speed and reliability continue to advance.\"\n\nHowever, consumers may need to wait a while before they can reap the benefits of this souped-up wi-fi. It's currently in the development phase, with demonstrations and trials likely to take place over the next two years before it lands in our homes. \n\nIndustry insiders also stress that serious infrastructure upgrades will be required to facilitate this wireless revolution. Everything from routers to internet service provider capabilities will need to be overhauled to meet the demands of this new technology, potentially pushing up costs.\n\nNevertheless, the anticipation of souped-up wi-fi signals a significant step forward for wireless technology. With the promise of a more seamless, efficient, and convenient internet experience on the horizon, it's an achievement that carries considerable weight in our increasingly digitized world.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen when and how smoothly this wil-fi evolution will manifest, the prospect of lightning-fast, robust, and reliable wi-fi connectivity is certainly an exciting perspective for a future of uncharted digital possibilities.",
    "Tech giant Apple has come under fire over allegations of sourcing materials from questionable suppliers, sparking a row over ethical supply chain practices. Critics argue that the company is not doing enough to ensure that its suppliers adhere to ethical and sustainable practices.\n\nThe controversy began when a report surfaced alleging that Apple sourced materials from mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where child labour and unsafe working conditions are rampant. The report, published by a human rights group, claims that Apple, along with other tech companies, indirectly funds conflict and human rights abuses in the DRC through its supply chain.\n\nApple has previously stated that it is committed to setting the highest standards for responsible sourcing. The company's Supplier Responsibility Progress Report outlines its efforts to hold suppliers accountable to a strict code of conduct, which includes provisions for safe working conditions and the prohibition of underage labour.\n\nHowever, critics argue that Apple's efforts are not enough. They claim that the company's supply chain audits are infrequent and lack transparency. Furthermore, they argue that Apple's reliance on third-party audits leaves room for corruption and misreporting.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Apple stated that it is dedicated to going above and beyond industry standards to ensure ethical sourcing. The company highlighted its efforts to map its supply chain for potential risks and its commitment to hold suppliers accountable.\n\n\"We require our suppliers to meet the strictest standards in the industry, and we regularly audit them to ensure compliance,\" said an Apple spokesperson. \"If a supplier is found to be in violation of our standards, we work with them to address the issue, and if necessary, we will terminate our relationship.\"\n\nDespite these assurances, the controversy has sparked a broader conversation about the responsibility of tech companies to ensure ethical sourcing. As consumers become increasingly conscious of the social and environmental impact of their purchases, companies like Apple are under pressure to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable and ethical practices.\n\nThe row over Apple's sourcing practices highlights the challenges faced by tech companies in maintaining ethical supply chains. As the demand for tech products continues to grow, so too does the need for transparency and accountability in sourcing the materials used to make them.",
    "Former England footballer, Bobby Moore, has raised questions about the current state of captaincy in the national team. Moore, who famously led England to World Cup victory in 1966, expressed his concerns in a recent interview with BBC Sport.\n\nMoore stated that the role of the captain has changed significantly since his time on the pitch. He believes that the current system, where the captaincy is often rotated among players, is detrimental to the team's performance.\n\n\"In my day, the captain was a constant. He was the leader on and off the pitch, and his role was clear,\" Moore said. \"Now, it seems like the armband is passed around like a hot potato, and I think that's a problem.\"\n\nMoore's comments come in the wake of England's disappointing performance in the recent European Championship, where they were knocked out in the round of 16. The team's captaincy was a topic of debate throughout the tournament, with several players taking on the role.\n\nThe former England captain also questioned the criteria for selecting the captain. He suggested that the role should not just be given to the team's best player, but to the one who can best lead and inspire the team.\n\n\"It's not about who's the most talented or who's the most popular,\" Moore said. \"It's about who can bring the team together, who can motivate and inspire. That's what a captain should do.\"\n\nMoore's comments have sparked a debate among football fans and pundits, with some agreeing with his views, while others argue that the modern game requires a different approach to captaincy.\n\nThe Football Association has yet to respond to Moore's comments. However, it is clear that the issue of captaincy is one that will continue to be discussed in the lead up to the next major tournament.",

    "In a candid interview, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has revealed the personal memory that has been the driving force behind his mission to improve global education. \n\nBrown, who served as the UK's Prime Minister from 2007 to 2010, has been a tireless advocate for education reform since leaving office. He has been particularly focused on ensuring that every child, regardless of their circumstances, has access to quality education.\n\nThe memory that fuels this mission, he revealed, is of his own childhood in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. Brown was born with a retinal detachment, which left him blind in one eye. Despite this, he excelled academically, thanks to the support of his parents and teachers.\n\n\"I was lucky,\" Brown said. \"I had parents who believed in education, and teachers who were dedicated to their students. But not every child is so fortunate. That's why I've made it my mission to ensure that every child, everywhere, has the same opportunities I had.\"\n\nBrown's passion for education is evident in his work as the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education. In this role, he has campaigned for increased funding for education in developing countries, and has worked to ensure that children in conflict zones have access to schooling.\n\nThe former Prime Minister also highlighted the importance of education in tackling global issues such as poverty, inequality, and climate change. \"Education is the key to solving many of the world's problems,\" he said. \"It's not just about equipping children with the skills they need to succeed in the modern world. It's about teaching them to be compassionate, responsible global citizens.\"\n\nBrown's commitment to education is not just driven by his personal experiences, but also by his belief in its transformative power. \"Education can change lives,\" he said. \"It can lift people out of poverty, give them a sense of purpose, and help them to shape a better future for themselves and their communities.\"\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Brown remains optimistic about the future of global education. \"We've seen incredible innovation in the way education is delivered over the past year,\" he said. \"I believe we can build on this to create a more inclusive, equitable education system for all.\"\n\nIn a world where millions of children are still denied their right to education, Brown's mission is more important than ever. His memory of the opportunities he was given, and the difference they made to his life, continues to drive his tireless work to ensure that every child has the chance to learn",
    "As the digital age advances, new technology is always on the horizon. Now, Sun Microsystems has launched a progressive initiative, offering unprecedented access to a powerful computing resource that is essentially paid for by the hour. \n\nThe radical initiative, dubbed \"Sun Grid\", offers businesses and researchers real-time access to supercomputing capabilities at the nominal fee of $1 per CPU hour. The concept is set to revolutionise the computing world, with Sun aiming to democratise access to top-tier computing facilities. \n\n\"This is for anyone who wants large scale, supercomputing class computational power without having to own or operate high performance computing resources,\" said Aisling MacRunnels, Senior Director of Sun Microsystems' utility computing division.\n\nPreviously, businesses and research facilities would have had to invest sizeable sums in their own supercomputing infrastructure to gain access to such computational power. Sun Grid, however, puts the power of high-performance computing in the hands of the masses.\n\nSun sees the opportunities for their system as virtually limitless, potentially aiding in everything from pharmaceutical research to animation. Companies that previously balked at the potentially astronomical cost of owning and operating a supercomputer may now reconsider.\n\n“What we’re doing is bringing to the table massively parallel supercomputing facilities and putting them in the hands of anyone,” MacRunnels explained. \"Imagine the possibilities it will open.\"\n\nHowever, questions surrounding security and reliance on a third-party provider for business-critical computational functions remain. Despite this, many experts are echoing Sun’s optimism, arguing that potential security hurdles can be solved by appropriate data protocols and encryption methods.\n\n\"The key here is to strike the right balance between convenience and security,\" said tech analyst, Liam Johnson. \"If Sun can maintain a strong security posture while delivering on its pay-per-hour promise, the Sun Grid could be a true game-changer in the field of computational facilities sharing.\"\n\nSun Grid is currently available for use in the United States, with rollouts to other territories expected in the near future. Companies and researchers interested in accessing the service are encouraged to visit the Sun Microsystems website for more details.\n\nThe times of only a select few having access to supercomputing capabilities may be drawing to a close, and with it, Sun Microsystems aims to shine a light on an exciting new chapter in digital technology. With processing by the hour now a reality, the future just got a whole lot brighter.",
    "Chilean victims of the Pinochet regime are set to receive considerable compensation after a US court ruled in their favour this week. The court instructed the Riggs Bank to compensate the victims. The bank was found guilty of concealing and laundering millions of dollars for the repressive regime led by Augusto Pinochet.\n\nPinochet, who led a military coup in Chile in 1973 and ruled until 1990, is believed to have hidden up to $1bn abroad. The money was allegedly laundered through several banks, primarily the now-closed Riggs Bank.\n\nThe victims who initiated the lawsuit against Riggs Bank include people who were tortured, bereaved or displaced during Pinochet's rule. The payout is being lauded as a significant victory for human rights activists who have bemoaned the lack of accountability for the extensive human rights abuses that transpired under Pinochet's rule.\n\nPinochet is accused of numerous human rights violations during his 17-year rule in Chile, including the disappearance and murder of thousands of opponents. The Riggs Bank, based in the US, was accused of aiding and abetting these abuses by helping him hide his wealth, making them complicit in his crimes.\n\nDetails of the financial settlement have not been publicly disclosed. However, the payout is expected to be considerable, a much-needed compensation for the extreme suffering inflicted upon the victims of Pinochet's regime.\n\nRiggs Bank has previously paid $16m to the US Justice Department over irregularities in its handling of Pinochet's accounts. This new payout will be dedicated specifically to the victims and their families.\n\nThe ruling by the US courts is significant and sets a precedent. It is the first legal conviction that holds a financial institution accountable for its involvement with the Pinochet regime.\n\nWhile this ruling is an important step towards justice for the victims, it also highlights the need for international vigilance to ensure banks and other institutions cannot be exploited by corrupt regimes for their personal advantage.\n\nHuman rights campaigners are hoping that this ruling will deter banks from becoming complicit in such crimes in the future. This could be a significant milestone in the pursuit of international justice and a way to acknowledge and compensate those who suffered under Pinochet's brutal rule.",
    "Zac Goldsmith, the former MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, has full-heartedly denied being pressurised into making any decisions during his service. Goldsmith asserted that he was never 'leant on' amidst allegations that he may have been influenced by outside factors. \n\n\"There wasn't a moment where I felt leant on or manipulated in any way,\" he commented, in response to the ever-increasing public speculation. \"Decisions I took were entirely my own,\" Mr Goldsmith added.\n\nThe former Conservative MP, who lost his parliamentary seat to Sarah Olney from the Liberal Democrats in a 2016 by-election, has been under political discussion for some time. Critics have suggested that he might have been susceptible to being swayed by influential figures within his party.\n\nThese speculations have plagued Goldsmith's political career following his controversial decision to not only resign from the Conservative party over its stance on a third runway at Heathrow but also decide to stand as an independent candidate in the resulting by-election.\n\nHowever, in a public statement, Goldsmith vehemently repudiated these claims and clarified that his choices were always a reflection of his personal principles and beliefs. He stated, \"At no point in my service was any external pressure applied on me to act against my convictions, and I strongly deny any suggested impropriety.\"\n\nHe further added, \"I always tried to act in the best interest of my constituents and the country, and I stand by every decision I made. My decisions were driven by values, not by pressures.\"\n\nGoldsmith, who made a return to politics following the general election in 2019, professed commitment to his work and his constituents, providing assurances that all his actions were in alignment with voter trusts and commitments.\n\n\"Maintaining public trust is a significant part of political service,\" he said. \"I have always taken this responsibility seriously and have therefore engaged in decision-making with absolute honesty and integrity.\"\n\nThe statements by Goldsmith are expected to provide some respite from the ongoing criticism and speculation regarding his political career. However, only time will dictate the full impact of his affirmations on his professional reputation.",

    "Controversial figure, Richard Bellamy, is once again under scrutiny following recent allegations of financial misconduct. The former CEO of the multinational corporation, Bellamy Industries, is facing a fresh wave of criticism and legal challenges.\n\nBellamy, who stepped down from his position at the helm of the company last year amidst a storm of controversy, is now being accused of financial improprieties that allegedly took place during his tenure. The allegations include misappropriation of company funds, tax evasion, and fraudulent accounting practices.\n\nThe new allegations were brought to light by a group of whistleblowers within the company, who claim to have evidence of Bellamy's misconduct. The group, who have chosen to remain anonymous, have handed over a cache of documents to the authorities, which they claim prove their allegations.\n\nBellamy has categorically denied the allegations, describing them as \"baseless and malicious\". In a statement released through his lawyers, he said, \"These allegations are a desperate attempt to tarnish my reputation. I have always conducted myself with the utmost integrity and will vigorously defend myself against these false accusations.\"\n\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has confirmed that it has launched an investigation into the allegations.

    "In a new leap towards economic reforms, the Egyptian government has announced its intention to sell one of its state-owned banks as part of its strategy to shore up its struggling economy.\n\nAccording to the Finance Minister's office, the government is preparing to privatize the United Bank of Egypt by selling it to either local or foreign investors. No specific details about the timeline for the sale, the expected price, or potential buyers have been released yet.\n\nThis move comes amid Egypt's broader effort to revive its sluggish economy, which has still been facing instability since the political instability in 2011. The United Bank of Egypt is known to be a significant financier for many large-scale projects across the country, including infrastructure and telecommunication ventures.\n\nThe decision to privatize the bank is seen as an acknowledgment by the Egyptian government of the need for economic reform and privatisation efforts to attract foreign investment, increase competition, and reduce public debt. \n\nThe Egyptian government has been increasingly looking for ways to encourage private sector investment in the country's vast public sector. It has already successfully floated parts of state-owned enterprises on the stock exchange as part of their initial public offerings (IPO).\n\nEgypt's decision to sell off the bank may improve its chances of securing much-needed foreign financial aid, potentially from the International Monetary Fund and other international organisations. The sale could also strengthen confidence in the country's banking system, while enhancing regulations that guarantee fair competition.\n\nCritics, however, expressed concerns over the decision's potential impact on state-owned assets and wealth, questioning whether it will indeed spur economic growth or result in wealth concentration. Concerns were also raised surrounding job security of the bank's employees post-sale.\n\nThe Egyptian government will be expected to shape the sale in a way that ensures transparency and competition, in line with its ambitious economic reform programme, and maintains job security for the bank's workforce, a significant number of people in the country.\n\nThe sale of the United Bank of Egypt is indeed a landmark decision that could profoundly impact the Egyptian economy and its financial sector. It signals a new era of transformations and sets the stage for similar privatisation initiatives that might follow.\n",

The production also took home the award for Best Director, making it a triumphant night for the team behind the show.\n\n\"The Producers\" tells the story of a down-on-his-luck Broadway producer and his mild-mannered accountant who come up with a scheme to produce the most notorious flop in history, thereby bilking their backers out of millions of dollars.

    "British rap artist Daniel James, also known as “DJ-D”, has sparked controversy by filming parts of his latest music video behind bars at a London prison. The move has ignited a national debate over the boundaries of art, privacy, and the country's penal system.\n\nJames, whose previous records had already touched upon themes of inner-city violence and the UK's prison system, was granted special permission by authorities to film inside HMP Brixton, a Category C men’s prison. The London-born rapper is already known for pushing societal boundaries with his music and performances, making this latest development consistent with his artistic style. \n\nThe music video was reportedly shot over a period of three days. It will feature James performing scenes in prison environment: in a cell, in the cafeteria, and several outdoor shots within the facility’s premises. While details of the video’s content are kept under wraps, James suggested it would parallel his lyrics that depict what he calls “real-life, raw struggle.”\n\nThe decision to permit the shoot draws attention to the ongoing debate about artistic expression within the context of the UK's penal system. Advocates argue that this is an opportunity to highlight the harsh realities within prisons, potentially driving support for prison reform. Critics, meanwhile, argue it could glorify criminal behavior or prison life.\n\nUpon confirming the news via his official Twitter account, James, who had previously served a prison sentence himself over drug charges, expressed his belief that he could use his music and platform to shed a light on the systemic issues within UK's prisons. \n\n\"I've been through the prison system. My music reflects that,\" he said in a tweet. \"Where better to shoot my video than where it all happened? If this can help someone rethink their decisions or catalyze jail reform, then it's more than just a song.”\n\nHowever, several politicians and public figures have criticized the initiative, claiming the rapper’s video could potentially turn prison into a 'celebrity playground' rather than a place for punishment and rehabilitation. Opposition to the video shoot also came from victims of crime, who regard such a scheme insensitive and inappropriate.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice has yet to comment on the issue. With the music video due for release soon, the debate over the decision to allow it to be filmed within a prison grows more contentious by the day.\n\nAs for DJ-D, his intention, as he reiterated in his tweets, is to use his music and platform to impact positively, encouraging those who may be at risk of following his old path, while signaling the need for prison reform.\n",

Bennett attributes part of his success to the relevance and urgency of the themes addressed in the play.\n\nIn a passionate acceptance speech, Bennett stated, \"I am truly overwhelmed with this recognition. 'Ripples of Time' is a piece very close to my heart, and I hope that it not only entertains, but also provokes thought about our role and responsibility towards our planet.\"\n\nThe Best Actor award went to Thomas Hardy for his heart-rending portrayal of a man grappling with the climate panic of his time, while the Best Director prize was won by Bennett himself, marking a first in Theatre Award history for a playwright to secure this accolade.\n\nThe play's lead actress, Olivia Fielding, was also nominated for Best Actress. Although she did not win, Fielding's nomination underscored the play's overall strength and quality, cementing it as a production of remarkable talent.\n\nWhile the event was marked by celebrating theatre's resilience in the face of pandemic-era challenges, the glamour did not overshadow the evening's underlying message of climate awareness.\n\n“Ripples of Time” continues its run at the Royal Court Theatre, promising audiences an emotional, thought-provoking evening that echoes far beyond the theatre's walls.\nBennett's success signals a bright future not only for him but also for thought-provoking, meaningful theatre. His work resonates with younger audiences particularly because of his ability to weave timely issues into compelling narratives.\n\nAs Bennett said in his acceptance speech, \"My only hope is that this play does its part in stirring consciousness and sparking conversations about our planet's future.\"",

    "The Liberal Democrats have emphasised a growing trust gap in the upcoming budget, criticising the Conservative Party's handling of the economy. They argue that the current government has not been fully transparent with the public about the economy's state and the necessary measures to improve it.\n\nIn a statement, Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, said, \"We are facing a crisis of trust in this government, and it is particularly evident when it comes to the budget. The current administration continues to offer vague promises without fully explaining the economic reality and what is required to overcome our economic challenges.\"\n\nThe party pointed to numerous issues in the government's handling of the economy, particularly the Brexit fallout and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic aftermath. They claim that these concerns have led to a widening trust deficit that the Conservative party should address immediately.\n\nDrawing on independent analyses, the Lib Dems suggest the amount of debt incurred due to Brexit and the pandemic has been under-reported. They claim this has painted an overly optimistic picture of the UK's financial situation, leaving citizens unaware of the full scenario and the subsequent economic decisions that may affect them.\n\nLib Dems are calling for complete transparency from Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the forthcoming budget. They argue that an honest evaluation of the economy is essential in formulating effective strategies and engendering public trust.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats also urged the government to prioritize economic measures that could protect businesses and jobs affected by the pandemic and Brexit. They suggested that failing to do so could lead to an increase in unemployment and poverty levels.\n\nFurther fuelling their argument, the Lib Dems referred to the recent public opinion poll where 68% of respondents didn't trust the government's handling of the economy. They are now stressing the importance of a budget that prioritises transparency, sustainability, and fairness, to restore public faith in the government.\n\nOn closing, the spokesperson said, \"The budget is one of the most critical tools to rebuild our economy. It should be handled with honesty, integrity and care. We cannot afford to have a trust gap when we need to work together as a nation to overcome the financial challenges we face.\"\n\nThe treasury and the Conservative Party have yet to respond to the criticisms raised by the Liberal Democrats. It remains to be seen whether the 'trust gap' highlighted by the party will be a key focus in the budget announcement.",

    "The Chief Executive Officer of McDonald's UK and Ireland, Paul Pomroy, has confirmed the sudden passing of the Managing Director, Mason Bell today. Mr Bell, aged 44, played a significant role in the McDonald's organisation and was seen as a dynamic leader and business innovator known for his tenacious work ethic.\n\nMr Bell was a renowned figure in the quick service restaurant sector with over 20 years of experience in the food industry. His sudden and unexpected death has stunned colleagues and business associates both inside and outside the McDonald's chain. \n\nIn his statement, Mr Pomroy described Mr Bell as a \"tremendously impactful leader\". He acknowledged the significant influence Mr Bell had on McDonald's growth in the UK and Ireland, using his unique strategies to increase sales and profit margins even in challenging market conditions. \n\n\"Mason epitomised the McDonald's spirit of hard work and dedication, tirelessly championing our commitment to providing high-quality food and a welcoming, relaxed environment for our customers,\" Mr Pomroy said.\n\nBefore taking up the role as the Managing Director of McDonald's UK and Ireland in 2016, Mr Bell held several positions within the food industry. He made his mark in the industry by challenging traditional operational procedures and implementing innovative practices that drove remarkable growth and diversification.\n\nUnder Mr Bell's strategic leadership, McDonald's UK and Ireland experienced significant digital transformation, mastering omnichannel retailing, and enhancing the overall customer experience. His pioneering work in integrating digital technology into operations redefined fast food service delivery, greatly expanding the company's customer base.\n\nHis colleagues also remembered Mr Bell as a compassionate leader who prioritised the welfare and morale of his staff. Ever conscious of the social responsibility that McDonald's held as a global giant in the fast-food industry, he was a leading advocate for employee rights and diversity in the workplace.\n\nHis efforts to foster a culture of inclusivity and respect extended not only to his employees but his local community as well, resulting in numerous corporate social responsibility initiatives under his tenure.\n\nMr Bell is survived by his wife and two young children. The McDonald's family extends its deepest sympathies to Mr Bell's family during this difficult time.\n\nSuccession plans for the role of Managing Director at McDonald's UK and Ireland are not yet known, with the company stating that it is too early to discuss what steps will be taken next.\n\nThis news follows a period of upheaval for the fast-food giant, as it deals with the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the restaurant industry. Yet, McDonald's demonstrated resilience under Bell",
    "In a landmark move, tech giant Apple Inc. has compelled a number of online blogs to disclose their sources of information. This unprecedented action has sparked a heated debate about the protection of journalistic sources and the boundaries of corporate influence.\n\nApple, known for its stringent control over information related to its products and services, has been grappling with leaks and rumours that often circulate on tech blogs and websites. The company has now taken a bold step to curb this issue by legally forcing these blogs to reveal their sources.\n\nThe move has been met with widespread criticism from journalists, bloggers, and free speech advocates. They argue that this could set a dangerous precedent, undermining the principle of source protection which is fundamental to investigative journalism.\n\n\"Apple's actions are a direct assault on the freedom of the press,\" said David Kaye, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and a former United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of expression. \"If corporations like Apple can force journalists to reveal their sources, it could have a chilling effect on investigative reporting.\"\n\nApple, however, maintains that its actions are justified. The company argues that these blogs are not engaged in legitimate journalistic activities, but rather in the dissemination of trade secrets, which is illegal. \n\n\"Apple respects the role of the press and the importance of freedom of expression,\" the company said in a statement. \"However, when individuals or organizations leak confidential and proprietary information, it undermines our ability to compete fairly in the marketplace.\"\n\nThe tech giant's move has also raised questions about the definition of journalism in the digital age. Many bloggers argue that they are indeed journalists, as they research, report, and disseminate news to the public, often with a significant following.\n\nThe case is likely to have far-reaching implications. If Apple succeeds, it could embolden other corporations to take similar actions against media outlets. On the other hand, if the courts rule in favour of the bloggers, it could strengthen the protections for online journalism.\n\nAs the debate rages on, the tech world will be watching closely. The outcome could reshape the relationship between corporations and the media, and redefine the boundaries of journalistic freedom in the digital age.",
    "Ministers have lost a significant legal battle over the controversial practice of \"slopping out\" in prisons, a term used to describe the lack of in-cell sanitation facilities forcing prisoners to use buckets and then empty them in communal areas.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruled that the practice was a breach of prisoners' rights, marking a significant victory for campaigners who have long argued that \"slopping out\" is inhumane and degrading.\n\nThe case was brought forward by a former inmate, who claimed that the practice had caused him distress and violated his rights to privacy and dignity. The court agreed, stating that the lack of in-cell sanitation facilities was a breach of the prisoner's rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice had argued that the practice was necessary due to the age and design of some prisons, and that it was not a breach of rights as long as prisoners had access to communal sanitation facilities. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that the practice was degrading regardless of the availability of communal facilities.\n\nThe ruling could have significant implications for the prison system in the UK, potentially leading to a wave of claims from other prisoners who have been subjected to the practice. It also puts pressure on the government to accelerate efforts to modernise and improve conditions in prisons.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice said it was \"disappointed\" with the ruling and is considering its next steps. A spokesperson stated, \"We have made significant progress in recent years to improve conditions in our prisons, but we recognise there is more to do.\"\n\nCampaigners, however, have hailed the ruling as a significant step forward. Frances Crook, Chief Executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \"This is a landmark judgement that recognises the basic rights and dignity of prisoners. It sends a clear message that the degrading practice of 'slopping out' has no place in a modern prison system.\"\n\nThe practice of \"slopping out\" was officially ended in England and Wales in 1996, but it has continued in some prisons due to infrastructure limitations. This ruling will likely increase the pressure on the government to ensure that all prisons meet basic sanitation standards.",
    "Leading tech behemoth, Apple Inc., has reportedly expanded its market share with the addition of new variants to its iconic iPod family. This intentional strategy, aimed at reaching a broader customer base and driving sales, ensures its dominance in the portable music player market.\n\nAccording to recent sales data, the expansion has successfully broadened the demographic appeal of the iPod range, and in turn, bolstered its position in the competitive personal electronics space. This success is attributed to the increased tiers of pricing, affording customers with varying economical backgrounds the opportunity to own an Apple device. \n\nThe flagship iPod Touch with increased storage and processing power continues to attract consumers who require a multi-functional device for music, videos, and games. Meanwhile, the less expensive iPod Shuffle and iPod Nano cater to those who want a simple, lightweight device solely for music. \n\nHowever, Apple's strategic decision isn't just about diversification. Each iPod model is tailored to cater to specific consumer needs - meeting various demands for screen size, storage capacity and additional functions. For instance, the iPod Touch, dubbed as \"a gaming device,\" targets younger consumers and gamers, while the iPod Nano, known for its ultra-sleek design and portability, appeals to fitness enthusiasts.\n\nApple's strategy is a clear indication of its adaptability and understanding towards a diverse consumer market. By continually reimagining and enhancing its iPod family, Apple ensures it remains all-encompassing, thus securing a loyal consumer base, while welcoming new Apple consumers.\n\nThough the iPod faces stiff competition from smartphones, which also provide music streaming services, this strategic expansion exhibits Apple's commitment to keep the iPod relevant and competitive. This expansion not only demonstrates Apple's prowess in innovation but also underlines its commercial acumen, as it continues to secure its market leadership in the music player segment.\n\nAs Apple continues to enhance its iPod family, consumers can confidently look forward to more versatile and innovative offerings that meet their evolving needs. This approach, coupled with Apple's reputation for quality and design, will undoubtedly serve to expand the tech giant's market even further in the coming years. \n\nThe iPod family's expansion is a consistent reminder of how Apple continues to evolve and reinvent its products, solidifying its position at the forefront of the tech world. The company’s commitment to delivering products that speak to a wide range of consumers underlines its ongoing success in an incredibly competitive marketplace.\n\nMeanwhile, market analysts will undoubtedly keep a close eye on Apple’s future enhancements and their impact on market share.

    "Several high-tech laboratories in Dublin, known for their contributions to global advancements in technology, are set to close after reports of substantial financial losses. This surprising development is expected to have a significant impact on the country's science and technology sectors, as well as Ireland’s international reputation as an attractive location to invest in cutting-edge research and development projects.\n\nThe labs, which range from biotech and pharmaceutical enterprises to software and hardware design hubs, have long been a stronghold for Ireland's tech industry. Not only have they ushered Ireland into the global tech race, but their closure also threatens the livelihoods of hundreds of employees who have been part of various groundbreaking projects.\n\nWhile the owners have yet to comment officially, it is understood they are struggling with a lack of funding, which was exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The nationwide lockdowns and subsequent economic recession significantly affected their financial stability and led to drastic losses.\n\n“This is a severe blow to the Irish technology sector”, stated Prof. Fiona Moriarty, a digital economy expert at the Dublin City University. “These laboratories have made major contributions to global innovation, technology development, and the creation of local jobs. Their closure will definitely be a loss for the city and the country as a whole”.\n\nThe Irish government has been heavily invested in transforming the country into a 'tech island', but these closures could jeopardise future ambitions. A government spokesperson said, \"We are very concerned about the situation and are looking into potential solutions.\"\n\nSeveral high-profile tech firms like Facebook, Google, and Airbnb, have their European headquarters in Dublin. While these companies are unaffected, there may be second-order effects resulting from the closure of labs heavily involved in research and product development.\n\nHowever, some industry insiders highlight the resilience of Dublin's tech community. They expressed confidence that the local tech industry could bounce back, relying on a vibrant start-up community which employs over 44% of all folks working in Irish tech hubs. Although the situation is grim, the dynamic city of Dublin is no stranger to technological reconstructions and we could yet see a second wave of tech evolution. \n\nFurthermore, the closure of these laboratories also has significant implications for universities and research institutions in the city. Several of these institutions had partnerships with the labs for collaborative research and student internships that will now come to a halt.\n\nThe broader impact on Ireland's tech industry remains to be seen, but the country is now facing a potential setback in its efforts to establish itself as a global technology hub. Given the continued uncertainty around the pandemic, it is unclear when we might see recovery",
    "Web logs, more commonly known as blogs, are proving to be invaluable tools in the recovery efforts following natural disasters around the world. They are transforming the way relief organisations and authorities relay crucial information to those affected, including updates on aid delivery and emergency procedures.\n\nFollowing a natural disaster, maintaining efficient communication channels can become a daunting task for governments and relief organisations. Traditional media often falls short in some respects, particularly when it comes to reaching those in remote locations. Web logs, however, are able to bridge this gap and deliver the much-needed information in near-real-time.\n\nIn the aftermath of last year's devastating earthquake in Nepal, for example, web logs proved crucial in helping to locate survivors, mobilise relief efforts and keep the global community informed about ongoing developments. \n\nMoreover, blogs offer a platform for disaster victims to share their stories and experiences firsthand. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in the United States, one person's live blog was widely disseminated, providing a unique perspective on the unfolding crisis and drawing attention to the urgent needs of those affected.\n\n\"The inexpensive nature of blogging makes it a viable tool for grassroots communication,\" says Ethan Zuckerman, a fellow at Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. \"Anyone with a smartphone can report from ground zero, providing a firsthand account that can prove pivotal in disaster recovery efforts.\"\n\nSimilarly, academic researchers are also turning to web logs to monitor and assess the effectiveness of disaster recovery operations. The transparency and convertibility of blog data allow them to analyse the progress and shortcomings of various initiatives in a way that was not previously possible with traditional media channels.\n\nDespite these advantages, experts caution that the reliance on web logs brings its own set of challenges. The spread of misinformation and 'fake news' can be potentially harmful during disaster relief efforts. Therefore, the sources of information should always be scrutinised for credibility.\n\nHowever, the potential of web logs in disaster recovery situations appears to outweigh these challenges. As our world becomes increasingly digital, the role of blogs in disaster recovery is expected to grow even more pronounced.\n\nThe rise of web logs in disaster recovery efforts is yet another testament to the transformative power of the digital world. These online platforms have proven that they are not just virtual diaries but are potent tools that can be harnessed for social good.",
    "Former Conservative leader Michael Howard has launched a scathing attack on the government's latest budget, labelling it a 'pay later' budget that will burden future generations with debt.\n\nMr Howard, who led the Tories from 2003 to 2005, criticised the Chancellor's decision to increase borrowing to fund public services, arguing that it would lead to higher taxes in the future. He also warned that the budget's focus on short-term spending could undermine the country's long-term economic stability.\n\n\"The Chancellor is essentially asking our children and grandchildren to foot the bill for today's spending,\" Mr Howard said. \"This is not a sustainable or responsible approach to managing the nation's finances.\"\n\nThe former Conservative leader also took aim at the government's plans to increase spending on health and education, arguing that throwing money at these sectors was not a guarantee of improved services.\n\n\"Simply pouring more money into health and education without ensuring it is spent effectively is not the answer,\" he said. \"We need to see real reform in these areas, not just a blank cheque.\"\n\nMr Howard's comments come as the government faces increasing criticism over its handling of the economy. Recent figures have shown a slowdown in economic growth, while inflation remains stubbornly above the Bank of England's 2% target.\n\nThe Chancellor has defended the budget, arguing that increased borrowing is necessary to fund vital public services and stimulate economic growth. He also insisted that the government has a credible plan to reduce the deficit over the medium term.\n\nHowever, Mr Howard dismissed these arguments, claiming that the government was simply \"kicking the can down the road\" and failing to take tough decisions on spending.\n\n\"The Chancellor is taking the easy way out by borrowing more and hoping for the best,\" he said. \"But this is a high-risk strategy that could leave future generations saddled with debt.\"\n\nMr Howard's intervention is likely to add to the pressure on the government as it seeks to defend its economic record in the face of growing public scepticism. It also highlights the deep divisions within the Conservative party over the best way to manage the economy.",
    "The ubiquity of camera phones in today's society is undeniable, with the latest research suggesting that they have become an essential item for most people. The rise of social media platforms, the need for instant communication, and the desire to capture and share life's moments have all contributed to the increasing demand for these devices.\n\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 96% of adults in the UK own a smartphone, with the majority citing the camera function as a key reason for their purchase. The study also revealed that 77% of smartphone users utilise their camera phones daily, highlighting the integral role these devices play in our everyday lives.\n\nThe evolution of camera phones has been rapid and transformative. From their humble beginnings as a mere 0.3-megapixel feature on early mobile phones, they have evolved into sophisticated devices capable of rivalling professional cameras. Today's top-end smartphones boast up to 108-megapixels, offering high-resolution images and a range of advanced features such as optical zoom, night mode, and portrait mode.\n\nThe rise of social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok has also played a significant role in the popularity of camera phones. These platforms encourage users to share photos and videos, creating a demand for high-quality, convenient photography tools. \n\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the importance of camera phones. With social distancing measures in place, many people have turned to video calls as a means of staying connected with loved ones. The camera phone, with its ability to facilitate face-to-face communication, has become an essential tool in this new normal.\n\nIndustry experts predict that the demand for camera phones will continue to grow. Future trends may include the integration of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, further enhancing the capabilities of these devices.\n\nHowever, the rise of camera phones has also raised concerns about privacy and security. With the ability to capture and share images at the touch of a button, there are fears about the potential misuse of this technology. As such, it is crucial for users to be aware of the risks and to use their devices responsibly.\n\nIn conclusion, the camera phone has become a 'must-have' item, playing a pivotal role in how we communicate, share experiences, and document our lives. As technology continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the camera phone will adapt and what new features will be introduced.",
    "UK retail sales have surged in the run-up to Christmas, indicating a festive fervour among consumers, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), retail sales volumes rose by 1.4% in November, beating market expectations. This follows a 0.3% decline in October, suggesting a strong rebound in consumer spending.\n\nThe festive fervour was particularly evident in the sales of household goods and online purchases. The ONS reported a 3.9% increase in household goods sales, while online sales saw a 2.6% rise, accounting for 28.5% of total retail sales.\n\nThe surge in retail sales comes as a welcome relief for the sector, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. The closure of non-essential shops during lockdowns led to a significant drop in sales earlier in the year. However, the recent figures suggest a robust recovery, fuelled by the festive season.\n\n\"The November data shows a strong rebound in retail sales, indicating that consumers are willing to spend despite the ongoing uncertainty,\" said Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte. \"The festive season has clearly given a much-needed boost to the sector.\"\n\nThe rise in sales was also reflected in the performance of individual retailers. John Lewis reported a 7.4% increase in weekly sales compared to the same period last year, driven by strong demand for Christmas decorations and gifts.\n\nHowever, despite the positive figures, some analysts warn that the retail sector is not out of the woods yet. The impact of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and potential new restrictions could dampen consumer spending in the coming months.\n\n\"The retail sector has shown remarkable resilience in the face of the pandemic, but the situation remains precarious,\" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. \"The impact of the Omicron variant and any potential new restrictions could pose significant challenges for retailers in the new year.\"\n\nNonetheless, the festive fervour reflected in the November retail sales offers a glimmer of hope for the sector. As consumers continue to adapt to the changing retail landscape, the resilience of the sector will be tested in the coming months.",

    "Tennis superstar, Rafael Nadal, continues his impressive run at the Mexican Open as he posts another solid performance, showing his detractors that his prowess on the court remains unchallenged.\n\nThe Spaniard, known for his aggressive play style and formidable resilience, continues to display the same form that took him to his record-extending 21st Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, proving that he still has ample fuel in the tank.\n\nIn the match held in Acapulco, a coastal city known for its beachside tennis courts, Nadal faced a tough challenge from his opponent but eventually managed to secure a convincing win demonstrating his class, experience, and finesse.\n\nShowing unwavering nerve in high-pressure situations, the 'King of Clay' gave fans a thrilling spectacle, firing off powerful serves, patented top-spin heavy groundstrokes, and making some breathtaking shots that took everyone by surprise, including his opponent.\n\nNadal’s ability to respond quickly, think on his feet, and change strategy mid-match to keep his opponent guessing has over the years consistently made him a crowd favorite. The Mexican Open was no exception to this as the crowd roared his name in appreciation of his tactical masterclass.\n\nThe major takeaway from this performance was Nadal's strength and agility. Despite being in his mid-thirties, where most players see their skills dip, the Spaniard seems to be defying age and continues to dominate at the highest level of the game. His glowing career is a testament to his exceptional talent, work ethic, and an undying will to win.\n\nThis victory takes him a step closer to bagging yet another title in his already crowded trophy cabinet, underlining why he belongs in the list of the greatest tennis players of all time.\n\nThe tournament, which started on Monday, has seen some thrilling encounters, and with Nadal's victory, anticipation is on the rise for an exciting finale. If he continues his current form, there's no telling what new heights Nadal might reach in Mexico. His next match will surely be one to watch as spectators around the world eagerly wait to see if the 'King of Clay' can further solidify his legacy.\n\nRafael Nadal has given sportswriters, fans and opponents many indelible moments over the years. And, on the current trajectory, it seems that he has many more to deliver as he shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. In the words of one awestruck fan, \"Long live the King!\"",
    "The investigation into doping allegations against renowned athlete, Jones, officially commenced today. The probe by the international anti-doping body comes after surprise revelations triggered considerable shock across the global sports fraternity.\n\nJones, a world record holder and a multi-disciplinary athlete has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, labelling the allegations as 'baseless' and 'an assault on his integrity'. The athlete stated that he has always been at the forefront of promoting ethical sporting conduct.\n\nThe International Anti-Doping Agency (IADA), have warned that this probe is likely to be lengthy and complex as a result of the individuals involved and the nature of the substances supposedly involved. If found guilty, Jones could face severe disciplinary action which may include a lengthy ban from all international sporting events, a fine, or both.\n\nThe allegations came to light after a high profile whistle-blower released a cache of documentations, supposedly implicating Jones and potentially other athletes in a far-reaching doping scandal. While these documents are yet to be independently verified, they appear to include evidence of generous payments made to unnamed parties for uncertain services.\n\nJones' legal team is expected to fight tooth and nail against these allegations. \"He has always played by the rules and has nothing to hide\", stated his lawyer, who also added that they look forward to cooperating fully with the investigation to clear his name.\n\nThe charges have sent shock waves through the sporting world, forcing a tough look at anti-doping regulations and transparency within international sports. The implications of this investigation are enormous, as it could potentially tarnish an incredible sporting career and reshape the international sports landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, fans and fellow athletes around the world are anxious and hoping that the allegations are untrue. Jones’ medal-laden career has seen him become a beloved figure, not just within his home country, but across the globe. His riveting performances and charismatic personality have been a source of inspiration for many budding athletes.\n\nThe IADA has promised a thorough investigation to ascertain the truth. It remains to be seen how this will unfold; it is no doubt a critical period for global sports administration and for a beloved icon of world athletics. \n\nThis is a situation that transcends a single athlete. It's an indictment on what can happen in a sector should the highest levels of ethical conduct not be upheld. As the investigation unfolds, the sporting world waits with bated breath for the outcome.",
    "Former Manchester United star, Ryan Giggs, has been appointed as the new manager of the Wales national football team. The Football Association of Wales confirmed the news on Monday, marking Giggs' first permanent managerial role.\n\nGiggs, who won 64 caps for Wales during his illustrious playing career, has signed a four-year contract. He succeeds Chris Coleman, who left to take charge of Sunderland in November.\n\nThe 44-year-old Giggs spent his entire playing career at Manchester United, where he won 13 Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, four FA Cups and three League Cups. He also served as interim manager for the club for four games at the end of the 2013-14 season following the departure of David Moyes.\n\n\"I am so proud to have been given the honour of managing the national team,\" Giggs said at a press conference. \"The challenges that we have ahead of us with the Nations League and qualification for UEFA Euro 2020 excite me a great deal.\"\n\nGiggs' appointment has been met with mixed reactions from fans. While some are excited about the prospect of a former player of Giggs' stature taking the helm, others have expressed concern about his lack of managerial experience.\n\nThe former winger, however, is confident in his ability to lead the team. \"I know there's a lot of hard work ahead, but I am confident that with the support of the fans and the FA, we can take Welsh football forward,\" he said.\n\nGiggs' first game in charge will be a friendly against China in March, as part of the China Cup tournament. His first competitive match will be in September when Wales kick off their UEFA Nations League campaign.",
    "Giant pandas in China are reaping the benefits of wireless technology, as conservationists turn to innovative solutions to monitor and protect these endangered animals. \n\nThe Wolong National Nature Reserve in Sichuan province, home to more than 150 giant pandas, has installed a wireless network across its vast expanse. This technology is being used to track the movements of the pandas, monitor their health, and ensure their safety in the wild.\n\nThe wireless network, which covers an area of over 200,000 hectares, is the first of its kind in China. It uses advanced sensors and cameras to collect real-time data on the pandas' behaviour, diet, and reproduction. This information is then transmitted to a central database, where it is analysed by a team of scientists.\n\n\"The wireless network allows us to monitor the pandas 24/7, without disturbing their natural behaviour,\" said Dr. Zhang Zhihe, director of the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. \"This is crucial for our conservation efforts, as it helps us understand the pandas' needs and adapt our strategies accordingly.\"\n\nThe network also plays a vital role in protecting the pandas from poaching and habitat destruction. It alerts the reserve's staff if any human activity is detected in the pandas' territory, allowing them to respond quickly and effectively.\n\nMoreover, the wireless technology is helping to educate the public about the plight of the giant pandas. The reserve has set up live-streaming cameras, which broadcast the pandas' daily activities to millions of viewers around the world. This has not only increased awareness about the species' conservation but also generated significant revenue for the reserve.\n\nThe success of the wireless network in Wolong has prompted other nature reserves in China to consider adopting similar technology. The Chinese government has also expressed its support for the project, recognising its potential to aid in the conservation of other endangered species.\n\nWhile the use of wireless technology in wildlife conservation is still relatively new, its effectiveness in the Wolong reserve suggests that it could become a vital tool in the fight against extinction. As Dr. Zhang said, \"The pandas are benefiting from the wireless net, and we hope that other species will too.\"",
    "Snooker legend Ronnie O'Sullivan has hinted that he may participate in the World Snooker Championship this year. The five-time world champion, known for his unpredictable decisions, has not yet confirmed his participation but has suggested that he is considering it.\n\nO'Sullivan, 45, has had a mixed season so far, with some impressive performances but also some unexpected defeats. However, his fans are hopeful that he will decide to compete in the World Championship, which is set to take place at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield from April 17 to May 3.\n\nIn a recent interview, O'Sullivan said, \"I'm not ruling it out. I'm just going to see how I feel and decide closer to the time. I love playing at the Crucible and it's always a special tournament, so we'll see.\"\n\nO'Sullivan, nicknamed 'The Rocket' for his rapid playing style, has a history of making last-minute decisions about whether to compete in tournaments. In 2012, he took a break from snooker for almost a year, before returning to win the World Championship in 2013.\n\nHis potential participation in this year's World Championship would undoubtedly add an extra layer of excitement to the tournament. O'Sullivan is one of the most successful players in the history of the sport, with a total of 37 ranking titles to his name.\n\nHowever, he has also been known for his controversial comments and unpredictable behaviour, both on and off the table. This has led to him being both one of the most loved and most divisive figures in snooker.\n\nThe World Snooker Championship is the most prestigious tournament in the sport, with a prize fund of £2.4 million. Last year's champion, Judd Trump, will be hoping to defend his title, but the potential presence of O'Sullivan could make that task significantly more difficult.\n\nO'Sullivan's fans will be eagerly awaiting his decision, and hoping that they will get to see him in action at the Crucible once again. Regardless of whether he decides to compete, his mere consideration of the idea is sure to generate plenty of discussion in the snooker world.",
    "In George Orwell's dystopian novel, '1984', the term 'Big Brother' was introduced to the world as a symbolic representation of the all-seeing, omnipotent government. Decades later, have we moved from symbolism to reality? Perhaps, if we take the time to analyse our modern surveillance states.\n\nFirst coined in 1948, 'Big Brother' has been a metaphor for a metanomic state entity capable of watching and recording every action and thought of the populace. Despite a slew of debates on privacy, surveillance has only become more prevalent in our society, with countless CCTVs in public spaces, companies tracking our online movements, and governments steadily increasing their electronic surveillance capabilities.\n\nThe power and influence once attributed solely to Orwell's fictitious entity now find iterations worldwide. The USA's National Security Agency, China's social credit system, and even our everyday interactions with tech companies like Google and Facebook are giving flesh and blood to 'Big Brother' in ways Orwell might have never imagined.\n\nChina's social credit system, often perceived as a surveillance beast, records every citizen's social, financial, and legal activities. It aims at 'civilising' society by rewarding or punishing citizens based on their 'trustworthiness'. Not far behind is the USA's National Security and Surveillance division, with whistleblower Edward Snowden unveiling their widespread surveillance programs in 2013.\n\nCloser home, major tech companies play a pivotal role in understanding the viewership patterns, purchasing tendencies, and overall behavioural traits of users. The algorithms designed by these tech giants can accurately predict user behaviour and preferences based on collected data. This level of surveillance, mostly justified for offering personalised user experiences, raises significant privacy concerns.\n\nBut those behind the curtain, governing this exercise in monitoring, are mostly institutions and digital enterprises instead of individuals. Although these national and international mechanisms have been likened to 'Big Brother', exactly who or what embodies 'Big Brother' is up for interpretation.\n\nThe physical embodiment of 'Big Brother' doesn't exist, yet its manifestation lives on in our everyday life. Despite being anonymous, 'Big Brother' isn't invisible. It watches us through a myriad of channels- be it the hidden CCTVs in our local parks or the seemingly harmless cookies tracking us even as we surf the internet.\n\nIn essence, the face of 'Big Brother' is disjointed, represented by bureaucratic institutions, tech platforms, and algorithmic systems that might just know us a bit too well. It is not the Orwellian figure looming over our lives, but a network of systems and individuals simpl",
    "The Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. is preparing to raise about $100 million through a share sale, according to sources close to the matter. According to reports, the leading global electronic marketplace for buying and selling securities, is planning the share sale as an attempt to invest in growth initiatives and keep up with its global expansion plans.\n\nHowever, the company has not provided any official comments about the share sale and the specific date of this sale remains undetermined.\n\nHaving become the second-largest stock exchange globally, Nasdaq has been undertaking numerous initiatives to diversify its business model. This latest move, if confirmed, would apply to both Class A and Class B shares, in line with Nasdaq's ambition to continue its worldwide expansion and potentially make more acquisitions.\n\nIndustry analysts suggest that the funds raised from the sale could help bolster Nasdaq's financial flexibility and provide the company with the resources necessary to carry out extensive research and development in the fintech domain.\n\nThe U.S.-based exchange has demonstrated a relentless urge to invest in financial technology companies and improve its overall technology offering, a fact that might explain its decision to embark on the $100m share sale. The company had previously announced that it plans to continually invest in the creation of innovative solutions for investors and traders.\n\nNasdaq, which competes with major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, made headlines last year with some high-profile IPOs, including Airbnb and DoorDash. However, the recent market volatility due to economic uncertainty has put pressure on the exchange’s revenues.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, Nasdaq reported net revenues of $851 million, up from $66 million from the same period in 2020. The extra capital might help Nasdaq make strategic investments and secure their growth in an increasingly competitive and technology-driven marketplace.\n\nIt’s unclear how this planned share sale could influence the company’s stock price in the short term.\n  \nInvestors will likely keep a close eye on further developments regarding the sale, and on how Nasdaq intends to deploy the funds raised.\n",
    "Chelsea director Peter Kenyon has finally denied widespread speculation about Arjen Robben's potential return to Barcelona. \n\nThe Dutch winger's future at Chelsea has been uncertain, with rumours circulating that he would be making a return to former club Barcelona. However, Kenyon has quashed these speculations, stating that Robben is not on his way back to Camp Nou. \n\n\"Arjen Robben is a key player and a valued member of our squad. We have no intentions of letting him go,\" Kenyon told BBC Sport. \"The club has an ambitious future and Arjen has an integral role to play in our plans.\"\n\nRobben, who moved to Chelsea from PSV Eindhoven in 2004, was reportedly unhappy with his role at the London club. However, Kenyon insisted that Chelsea's head coach, Jose Mourinho, rates Robben highly and sees the Dutchman as an essential feature of his strategic plans for the coming season. \n\n\"Jose Mourinho has his plans, and Arjen fits well into that. We believe he brings a unique quality to our team,\" Kenyon added.\n\nBarcelona were reportedly keen to lure the Dutch international back to Spain and add him to manager Frank Rijkaard's star-studded line-up. However, their bid seems to have been foiled with Kenyon's latest statement.\n\nThe Catalan giants have enjoyed previous success in recruiting players from Chelsea, notably Iceland striker Eidur Gudjohnsen. However, it seems that they will not be able to add Robben to their acquisitions list.\n\nUnconfirmed rumours about Robben’s dissatisfaction at Stamford Bridge have been making rounds. Some suggest it might be due to his struggle with injuries in the past seasons. However, no official statement has been made either by Robben, his agent or the club concerning these speculations.\n\nKenyon's comments should put any doubts over Robben's immediate future to rest. However, such emphatic dismissals are not usually the end of speculation in football. With the transfer window still open, the saga involving Robben and Barcelona may not be completely over just yet.\n",
    "The UK government has unveiled a new plan that aims to give the elderly more control over their care. The proposal is part of a broader strategy to reform the country's social care system, which has been under increasing strain due to an ageing population.\n\nUnder the new plan, elderly people will be given the power to decide who provides their care and how it is delivered. This could include choosing between different care providers, deciding on the type of care they receive, and having a say in the timing and frequency of care visits.\n\nThe government believes that giving the elderly more control over their care will not only improve their quality of life but also make the care system more efficient. It is hoped that by allowing people to make choices about their care, resources can be allocated more effectively and waste can be reduced.\n\nThe plan has been welcomed by charities and organisations working with the elderly. Age UK described it as a \"positive step forward\" and said it could help to \"empower older people and give them a greater sense of independence\".\n\nHowever, some critics have raised concerns about the practicality of the plan. They argue that many elderly people may not be able to make informed decisions about their care due to cognitive impairments or a lack of understanding about the care system. There are also concerns that the plan could lead to increased inequality, with those who are more knowledgeable and assertive being able to secure better care.\n\nThe government has acknowledged these concerns and has promised to provide support to help people make decisions about their care. This could include providing information and advice, as well as offering advocacy services for those who need them.\n\nThe plan is part of a wider package of reforms to the social care system, which also includes increased funding for care services and measures to improve the quality of care. The government has said that it is committed to ensuring that everyone, regardless of their age or health condition, has access to high-quality, personalised care.\n\nThe proposal will now be subject to a period of consultation, during which the government will seek views from the public, care providers, and other stakeholders. The final plan is expected to be published later this year.",
    "Investor confidence has spiked at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSE) as the KSE 100 index reached a record high. Karachi, the nation's economic hub, saw its index leap to unprecedented levels, demonstrating a milestone in its recovery from previous economic hardships.\n\nThe KSE 100 index, a benchmark used to evaluate the performance of the country’s economy, crossed the 50,000 mark for the first time in history, up from a mere 40,000 six months ago. The meteoric rise has been spurred by aggressive buying in banking, cement, and energy shares, in response to favourable economic indicators and increased international investor confidence.\n\nSupported by recent political stability and the introduction of key economic reforms by the government, the index has surpassed all prior records. \"A stable rupee along with low-interest rates and inflation rates are encouraging investors. In addition, the government’s initiative to digitise the economy has also contributed significantly to this unprecedented growth,\" said Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak-Kuwait Investment Co.\n\nThe market's impressive performance also comes as Pakistan reaches out to international lenders to offset the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Islamabad extended its loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), helping to shore up foreign reserves and return stability to the market. Moreover, the government's efforts to secure a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) green rating have started to bear fruit, attracting both local and international investors.\n\nThere are also underlying hopes that the momentum will be sustained. The successful drive of Covid-19 vaccinations across the country, coupled with the government's commitment to long-term infrastructure plans under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), have given domestic and international investors a reason to remain hopeful. \n\n\"Global investors are increasingly looking towards emerging economies for high growth opportunities. Karachi's robust performance signifies an upbeat economic potential marking a positive development for Pakistan,\" added Mr. Tariq. \n\nUndoubtedly, the alteration in Pakistan's macroeconomic landscape has led to this historic high in Karachi stocks. Nevertheless, experts advise caution, urging the government and regulators to keep an eye on the market to avoid speculative behaviour and maintain sustainable development.",
    "Newcastle United has reportedly entered the race to sign Spanish striker Fernando Morientes, adding another twist to the ongoing transfer saga. The Magpies are set to compete with a host of top European clubs, including Liverpool and Monaco, for the Real Madrid forward's signature.\n\nMorientes, 28, has been on the fringes of the Real Madrid squad this season, leading to speculation about his future at the Bernabeu. Despite his limited playing time, the Spaniard has a proven track record, having scored 72 goals in 182 appearances for Los Blancos.\n\nNewcastle manager, Sir Bobby Robson, is believed to be a long-time admirer of Morientes and sees him as the ideal addition to his squad. The Magpies have struggled for goals this season, and the acquisition of Morientes could provide the much-needed firepower upfront.\n\nHowever, Newcastle will face stiff competition for Morientes' signature. Liverpool manager, Rafael Benitez, has also expressed interest in the striker, who he managed during his time at Valencia. Meanwhile, Monaco, where Morientes spent a successful loan spell in the 2003-04 season, leading them to the Champions League final, are also keen on a reunion.\n\nThe transfer fee for Morientes is expected to be in the region of £10 million, a figure that Newcastle are reportedly willing to meet. However, the player's wage demands could prove to be a stumbling block, with Morientes currently earning around £60,000 per week at Real Madrid.\n\nDespite the competition, Newcastle are confident of securing Morientes' services. A club source said, \"We are in the race and we believe we have a good chance. Morientes is a top player and he would be a fantastic addition to our squad.\"\n\nThe transfer window opens on January 1, and it remains to be seen where Morientes will end up. But one thing is for sure, the race for his signature is heating up, and Newcastle are firmly in the mix.",
    "In a lively session of Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), the UK's Prime Minister faced a barrage of inquiries from MPs on a range of pressing issues. The weekly event, held every Wednesday at noon, is a cornerstone of British democracy, providing a platform for MPs to hold the government to account.\n\nThe Prime Minister was grilled on a variety of topics, including the government's handling of the pandemic, the state of the economy, and the ongoing climate crisis. Opposition leaders also took the opportunity to question the Prime Minister on recent controversies, including allegations of corruption within the government.\n\nThe Prime Minister defended his government's record, arguing that they had taken decisive action to protect public health and support the economy during the pandemic. He also highlighted the government's commitment to tackling climate change, pointing to recent investments in renewable energy and green technology.\n\nHowever, opposition MPs accused the Prime Minister of failing to address the key issues facing the country. They criticised the government's handling of the pandemic, arguing that a lack of clear communication and strategic planning had contributed to the UK's high death toll. They also raised concerns about the state of the economy, with many arguing that the government's support measures had not gone far enough to protect jobs and businesses.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Questions session also saw heated exchanges over the issue of climate change. While the Prime Minister emphasised the government's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, opposition MPs argued that more urgent action was needed to address the climate crisis.\n\nThe session ended with the Speaker of the House calling for a return to order, but not before a number of MPs had made impassioned speeches on issues close to their hearts. As always, the Prime Minister's Questions provided a snapshot of the key debates and controversies shaping British politics.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Questions is a crucial part of the UK's democratic process, allowing MPs to scrutinise the government and hold it to account. Today's session was no exception, with the Prime Minister facing tough questions on a range of issues. As the country continues to grapple with the challenges of the pandemic and the climate crisis, these weekly exchanges will remain a vital forum for debate and accountability.",
    "The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) appears to have a secret weapon amidst the push and pull of Brexit. Richard Braine, UKIP's newly elected leader, is said to be this stealthy instrument, lending the party fresh vim and vitality.\n\nA technology entrepreneur, turned politician, Mr. Braine's vigor and dynamism have already been hailed as driving forces behind UKIP's political intent, especially in relation to Brexit. His fresh perspective and pragmatic approach are giving hope to UKIP supporters. There is optimism that Braine could be the catalyst needed to revitalise the party's falling membership, and attract voters from other parties, particularly from the Brexit Party and Conservatives.\n\nFrom a more extensive perspective, Richard Braine's acuity might be the secret weapon that UKIP has been seeking. As a party that is driven by the will to see Brexit through, UKIP has struggled with disunity and a wavering support base in the face of roiling political uncertainty.\n\nGiven his experience outside politics, colleagues of Braine believe his business acumen may prove valuable in politics, particularly in the Brexit debate. \"Richard can see through the fog and uncertainty. He has a mind for strategy and a talent for communication which is very much needed in these turbulent political times\", said a close party ally who preferred not to be named.\n\nBraine's platform has appealed vastly to the party's core voters. His goal to get Brexit delivered, curbing mass immigration, and putting a cap on foreign aid align with the party's vision.\n\nHowever, critics question whether his appeal will extend beyond the Eurosceptic party. After significant losses in the 2019 European elections and a declining membership, UKIP has been on a struggle to become a potent force in the British politics.\n\nIn what some are terming the advent of the 'Braine era' in the UKIP, the spotlight is now firmly on the party's potential secret weapon to win back some of the lost political ground. Whether or not the new leader's robust gusto can translate to political weight will be proven in months to come. The stakes are high for UKIP, and only time will confirm whether Richard Braine proves, in the end, to be the dynamic element they're counting on. Boasting both the intellect and the passion, Braine may just be the secret weapon that UKIP needs to reclaim its influence. \n\nIt's an uphill battle for UKIP, but with Braine at the helm, supporters believe the party can once again become a worthy contender in the political arena.",
    "In a bid to inspire political engagement among younger generations, schools across the country are gearing up to host a simulated polling event. The initiative is designed to introduce students to the democratic process, and give them an understanding of how elections work in the UK.\n\nThe initiative, organised by the educational charity 'Future Voters', will allow children to participate in a mock election, replicating the voting process that takes place across the nation. Students will learn about the importance of voting, the role of representation and how political decisions impact their daily lives. \n\nSchools from across the country will each represent a constituency, with students standing as candidates, campaigning on certain issues and eventually voting in the mock election. The process will mirror the real-life experience of participating in a general election, giving students as young as nine an insight into the electoral process.\n\nFuture Voters says the aim of the project is not only to educate students but to increase the interest in politics and social issues among young people, believing that understanding and participating in the process is the first step to making changes in society.\n\nThe charity's spokesperson, Jane Hardcastle, said: \"This initiative educates young people about democracy, representation, and the importance of voting. This isn't about political bias - it's about involving young people in the process, helping them understand why their voice matters and how they can make a difference.\"\n\nThe mock election will start with students forming their own political parties and creating manifestos on issues that matter to them. They'll then campaign for votes among their peers, before a full, school-wide vote is conducted. The results will provide a fascinating insight into the political mindset of the younger generation.\n\nThe Secretary of State for Education has applauded the initiative, recognising the importance of political literacy among young people. \"These mock elections are an excellent way of teaching children about the democratic process,\" they said. \"It's important that our young people understand how government works, and that they are inspired to participate in the democratic process as they grow older.\"\n\nSeveral schools have previously taken part in similar exercises. Teachers at these schools have reported increased student engagement with political issues and a greater understanding of the importance of voting.\n\nIn a world where politics increasingly impacts our daily lives, early understanding through engagement may be key to raising a generation of informed, active citizens. This mock election initiative presents an intriguing opportunity to kick-start political conversations, making the voting process less intimidating for the future generation of voters. It also allows children to realise the power of their voice in society.",
    "Public anger is mounting across the UK as the controversial practice of house arrests continues to draw widespread criticism from both civilians and political figures alike.\n\nHouse arrest is a measure where a person is detained by state authorities within a confined space, typically their own home, rather than being imprisoned in a conventional jail. Recently, an increasing number after court cases have resulted in such verdicts, triggering an escalating wave of opposition.\n\nCompelling objections relating to privacy concerns, potential for abuse, and questions about its effectiveness as a rehabilitation method have been raised by a myriad of sources. Human rights campaigners argue that arbitrary detention within a personal residence infracked on fundamental human rights, while critics from the legal field underline the potential for arbitrary enforcement and misuse.\n\nA recent survey carried out by the Civil Liberties Union (CLU) indicated that up to 62% of respondents felt that house arrests were an unacceptable form of punishment, showing a clear indication of public reticence towards this practice. \n\nOpposition is also sprouting from the political field. Members of parliament across party lines are coming together to voice their concerns over the issue. A cross-party group, led by veteran Labour MP, Linus Blakemore and Conservative MP, Elizabeth Waterhouse, is preparing to table a motion in the House of Commons opposing this contentious practice. \n\n\"The house arrest systems present serious implications for the freedoms and liberties of the people,\" warns Mr. Blakemore who, with his team, is urging for an immediate review of such verdicts. \n\nElizabeth Waterhouse argued that house arrests could potentially leave room for inconsistency in judgments, therefore, potentially compromising the fair justice system Britain prides itself on. \n\nThe UK Government has yet to answer to these rising concerns. As the opposition grows louder, questions over the ethics and implementation of house arrests continue to simmer. It remains to be seen how the UK Government and the judiciary will react to the mounting pressures of this controversial issue. \n\nPolice and the Ministry of Justice have been approached for comment.",

Despite enduring some strains on their relationship over the years, the partnership has been beneficial for both parties, producing some of the industry's most renowned car models.\n\nHowever, with the recent industry-level changes and company-specific issues looming, the partnership's future hangs in balance. The discussions that GM is expected to have with Fiat revolve around the areas of strategic repositioning to enhance their value proposition in the post-pandemic world.\n\nGM, the largest automobile manufacturer in the United States, has been on a path of major transformation, focusing on future technologies like electric and autonomous vehicles. Simultaneously, Fiat is navigating challenges arising from its recent merger with French carmaker PSA Group, forming a new company, Stellantis.\n\nThe ongoing talks between the two giants might result in a number of potential outcomes, including an extension of their existing alliance, a deal to develop new technologies together or even a full merger. However, as pressures mount, even a complete breakup cannot be ruled out.\n\n“These are critical discussions for both GM and Fiat. With growing emission regulations, transitioning to electric vehicles and the increasing need for advanced technological features, partnerships can offer an affordable and quicker way to adapt,” said an unnamed source privy to discussions.\n\nHe also added \"Even though the backdrop looks challenging, this could also be an opportunity for both GM and Fiat. Pulling the right levers, the companies can make strategic decisions that would set the course for future growth.\"\n\nThese so-called “crunch talks” represent a juncture of great significance not only for GM and Fiat, but the global automotive industry as a whole. The decisions made in the boardrooms will likely influence the competitiveness and longevity of these industry majors in the fierce global automotive market. \n\nNeither GM nor Fiat commented directly on them being in talks, but both companies stated their dedication to continuous innovation, sustainable solutions and creating value for shareholders.\n\nExperts agree that regardless of the outcome, these are pivotal times for the global automotive industry and a reminder that even",
    "The Eurotunnel is facing significant challenges as the rise of low-cost airlines, particularly those flying domestic and short-haul international routes, has emerged as a major threat to its revenues.\n\nOver the past few years, budget airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet have been expanding their services across Europe, presenting competitive alternative travel options to cars, trains, and ferries. Travellers are increasingly opting for budget airline flights due to their efficiency in covering long distances and cost-effectiveness, which is causing concerns for Eurotunnel.\n\nAccording to recent figures, the number of passengers travelling through the Eurotunnel has seen a significant dip, marking its worst performance since the economic recession of 2008. Eurotunnel’s core business, the shuttle services, witnessed a decline of 4.6%, while the passenger numbers on Eurostar, which also uses the tunnel, dropped by 5%.\n\nWhile the rise of budget airlines could be seen as a key cause, Brexit-related uncertainties also played a role in this declining trend. Notably, the confusions regarding travel restrictions and custom checks post-Brexit have added to the woes of Eurotunnel.\n\nA spokesperson for Eurotunnel highlighted that they are working to combat this challenge. \"While we acknowledge the impact of low-cost airlines and Brexit concerns on our performance, we are also considering them as catalysts to improve our services. We are adopting a customer-centric approach and focusing on upgrading our amenities, connectivity, and making our pricing more competitive.\"\n\nIn contrast, budget airlines report a boom, attributing their growth to a combination of competitive pricing, an extensive network of routes, and appealing to a younger demographic. A spokesperson for Ryanair said, \"We are capitalising on the demand for cheap, reliable, and flexible travel options in Europe.\" \n\nThe Eurotunnel, which celebrated its 27th anniversary this year, has been an iconic contributor to the UK and France’s economy. The 50.5 km channel provides passage to over 20 million passengers each year and has been an essential part of the UK's trade with the European Union. \n\nHowever, with the emergence of budget airlines and the visible dent in the Eurotunnel's profits, analysts predict that the company will need to overcome significant challenges in order to maintain its position as a leading player in the European transport industry.",
    "The uptake of broadband internet services recorded a significant rise in 2004, jobbing forward the UK’s digital economy and transforming the way people work, shop, and communicate.\n\nA report from the Office of Communications (Ofcom) reveals that over 8 million households in the UK are now connected to broadband, compared with 3.2 million in 2003 -- a stunning 150% increase in a single year. This boom in broadband adoption underpins the rapid growth in the digital economy, with more and more UK consumers opting for online retailing over traditional brick-and-mortar shopping.\n\n\"The internet has fundamentally changed the way we live and work, and it's clear that broadband is at the heart of this revolution,\" said Ofcom Chief Executive, Stephen Carter. He added that the soaring demand for broadband was a reflection of UK citizens' \"appetite for a faster, more reliable internet connection.\"\n\nBritain's telecom giants including BT and Virgin Media have played a crucial role in rolling out broadband connectivity across the country, with competitive pricing and attractive packages contributing to the rapid uptake. The advent of bundled services, where customers receive television, phone and internet in one deal, is also seen as a key driver.\n\nUnderscoring the shift to online, internet advertising grew by a record 60% to £653 million in 2004 - overtaking radio advertising for the first time. This heady growth is spurred by businesses investing in digital marketing, as more consumers use the internet for shopping, entertainment and work.\n\nThe rapid expansion of broadband has also fuelled a revolution in home working, with many taking advantage of improved connectivity to work more flexibly, leading to a better balance between personal and professional life.\n\nHowever, the Ofcom report also highlighted the growing issue of a \"digital divide\", with some rural areas lagging behind in broadband access. The government is urged to ensure equal access to these transformative technologies, as broadband increasingly becomes a necessity in daily life.\n\nAs the UK enters the 5G era, which promises even faster speeds and more reliable connections, broadband's continued growth seems assured. The journey from 2004 only marks a starting point in an ongoing digital transformation, with the internet's potential still largely untapped.",
    "Oil prices have rallied, bouncing back from their recent slump caused by extreme weather conditions, reinforcing the commodity's resilience in turbulent times. The rebound followed a period of disruption due to unseasonable conditions that affected output from several major oil-producing nations.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, rose to $68.91 a barrel – a noticeable upswing compared to its low price amidst the weather-related disturbances. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the US standard, surged to $65.36 per barrel, a significant recovery from its previous dip.\n\nIndustry insiders attribute this reassuring rebound in prices to multiple factors. A decrease in US inventories, coupled with an increase in demand as global economies reopen from coronavirus lockdowns, is playing a notable role in bolstering prices.\n\n\"The weather-related interruptions in Texas and other oil-producing states indeed battered the industry and resulted in temporary price fluctuations,\" said Daniel Yergin, an energy expert. \"However, the swift rebound reflects the robustness of the oil market despite such adversities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with its allies, including Russia - a group known commonly as OPEC+, maintains a cautiously optimistic outlook. OPEC+ has implemented production cuts aiming to reduce the global supply glut and stabilise prices. The rebound also underscores the apparent effectiveness of these efforts, as the weather-related disturbances did not cause a long-lasting drop.\n\nBesides, a continuation of the current trend could see oil prices returning to pre-pandemic levels. However, the trajectory of the market largely depends on factors such as vaccine rollouts, ease of travel restrictions, and strengthening of global economies.\n\nNevertheless, the recent rebound has put oil-market traders and investors somewhat at ease. The swift recovery suggests that while the oil market isn't free from adverse weather spurred disruptions or other external factors, it remains comparatively resilient.\n\nThe market is awaiting a more solid stability that can only be achieved when the global vaccine rollout accelerates, leading to the revival of the sectors heavily reliant on oil such as aviation and tourism. With such sectors rebounding, the demand for oil is expected to reach its pre-pandemic level, reinforcing the trend in oil price recovery.\n  \nOn a larger scale, the revival of oil prices consolidates a central role for the commodity in the global economy, even as discussions on a transition to greener energy sources continue to make headlines. Despite the challenges, oil continues to demonstrate its paramount importance as a pillar supporting the global economic structure, with its recent rebound as a testament.",
    "UK Home Secretary Charles Clarke is facing mounting opposition from within his own party over plans to introduce ID cards. The controversial legislation, set to be debated next week, has sparked a rebellion from at least 30 Labour MPs who claim the scheme infringes on citizen's privacy rights.\n\nMr Clarke has strongly argued for the necessity of ID cards, citing them as an essential tool in curbing organised crime and illegal immigration. However, the plans have faced an uphill battle, with concerns over the cost of implementation, potential misuse of data, and infringements on privacy rights.\n\nThe bill was previously passed in the House of Commons in February with a thin majority. Yet, it has since met strong opposition in the House of Lords, where peers have noted concerns about data protection and civil liberties.\n\nChief among the rebels is former Labour Minister, Dr John Reid who warned that the proposed ID cards would give \"more power to the state at the expense of individual liberties.\" A sentiment echoed by a number of backbench Labour MPs. Notably, some from the governing party are prepared to risk a clash with their leadership by joining with the Scottish National Party and Green MPs to vote against the ID card bill.\n\nThe scheme also faces opposition from the Lib Dems and Tory MPs who argue it represents unnecessary state meddling in private lives. The Conservatives, while not against ID cards in principle, have demanded better accountability for the costs and a stronger case for their effectiveness. \n\nAmid this rebellion, the Home Secretary will need to make compelling arguments during the debate next week to rally support for the bill. A Home Office spokesperson indicated that Mr Clarke still believes it will be an \"increasingly important means of confirming identity.\"\n\nHowever, Ian Davidson, a vocal critic of the plan, doubts it will be successful. Davidson, a Labour MP stated: “It does not seem to be cost-effective, necessary or likely to work; I shall be voting against.”\n\nDespite this internal opposition, the government maintains that the introduction of ID cards will combat identity fraud and terror threats, with PM stating that it is \"absolutely fundamental\" for national security. But with an increasing number of MPs voicing their disapproval, Mr Clarke's proposed ID card scheme will surely undergo rigorous debate and scrutiny in the days ahead.\n",
    "A disagreement is escalating over the increasing use of advertisements on peer-to-peer sharing networks, with some proclaiming the practice as a potential new revenue model, while others decry it as disruptive and dangerous.\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) networks, which allow users to share and download digital files directly from each other, have proven incredibly popular for video and music sharing. However, some developers have recently begun embedding advertisements in these networks, leading to a massive outcry from users and advocacy groups alike.\n\nCritics argue that these embedded campaigns negatively impact user experience and risk compromising personal data. \"The introduction of adverts on these platforms inevitably means that user data is being harvested,\" warned Alice Horner, a cyber-security expert at City University. \"It's a murky territory at best and raises significant privacy and security concerns.\"\n\nBut supporters of the new model see it differently. They assert that the adverts are a way to fund the operation of these services which are often free for users. ExDev Software, a firm that recently introduced adverts to its P2P platform, provided its perspective. \"Our goal is to maintain a free platform where users can share content. The revenue from the adverts goes directly towards server maintenance and upgrading our infrastructure,\" said Tom Anderson, CEO of ExDev Software. \n\nHowever, these assurances have done little to mitigate concerns. \"We've seen similar justifications made by social media platforms,\" said Abby Luis from the Privacy International. \"The reality often involves much more widespread data collection practices than initially disclosed\".\n\nSeveral activist groups are now rallying users to voice their disapproval, threatening a mass exodus from ad-supporting platforms. Meanwhile, reports suggest governing bodies, like the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, may begin probing peer-to-peer platforms for potential violations under data protection laws.\n\nIn contrast, some insiders claim the controversy could be beneficial. \"This debate may push for the development of better and more transparent monetisation methods,\" opined Robert Jenkins, an independent digital economy analyst. \n\nAs the row simmers, it is clear that both users and regulators will be taking a more rigorous look at the evolving world of peer-to-peer sharing and its larger implications. The tussle over adverts may just be the spark for broader discussions on privacy and digital ownership rights in the coming days.",
    "Hundreds of campaigners gathered over the weekend to rally for the extension of the Borders Railway from Tweedbank to Carlisle. The event, organised by the Campaign for Borders Rail (CBR), saw a significant turnout, with supporters from across the region and beyond.\n\nThe rally was held at Tweedbank station, the current terminus of the Borders Railway. Supporters of the extension argue that it would bring significant economic and social benefits to the region, including improved transport links, increased tourism, and job creation.\n\nThe Campaign for Borders Rail has been lobbying for the extension of the railway for several years. The group believes that the current line, which runs from Edinburgh to Tweedbank, has been a success since it opened in 2015, but that extending it to Carlisle would unlock even greater potential.\n\nSimon Walton, chairman of the CBR, addressed the crowd at the rally. He said, \"The turnout today shows the strength of feeling about this issue. The Borders Railway has already brought many benefits to our region, but we believe that extending the line to Carlisle would be a game-changer.\"\n\nMr Walton added, \"This is not just about transport, it's about economic regeneration and social inclusion. We're calling on the government to recognise the potential of this project and give it the green light.\"\n\nThe rally also saw speeches from local politicians, business leaders, and community representatives, all of whom voiced their support for the extension. Many highlighted the success of the existing Borders Railway, which has exceeded passenger forecasts since it reopened six years ago.\n\nThe Scottish government has previously committed to examining the feasibility of extending the Borders Railway to Carlisle. However, campaigners are calling for a firm commitment and a clear timeline for the project.\n\nThe rally ended with a march along the proposed route of the extension, with campaigners hoping that their show of support will help to keep the issue high on the political agenda.\n\nThe Campaign for Borders Rail plans to continue its lobbying efforts in the coming months, with further rallies and events planned. The group is also encouraging supporters to write to their local MPs and MSPs to express their support for the extension.",
    "Former Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, is set to call for significant reform in the House of Lords, arguing that the current system is outdated and undemocratic. Lord Kinnock, who was appointed to the Lords in 2005, will make his case in a speech at the University of Oxford later today.\n\nLord Kinnock is expected to argue that the House of Lords, the UK's upper chamber of Parliament, should be wholly or mainly elected, rather than appointed. He will also call for a reduction in the number of peers, which currently stands at over 800, making it the second-largest legislative assembly in the world after China's National People's Congress.\n\n\"The House of Lords is a relic of a bygone era,\" Lord Kinnock will say, according to extracts of his speech released in advance. \"It is high time we brought our democratic institutions into the 21st century.\"\n\nLord Kinnock's intervention comes amid growing calls for reform of the House of Lords. Critics argue that the chamber is too large, too costly, and lacks democratic legitimacy because its members are not elected. There have also been concerns about the appointment process, with accusations of cronyism and political patronage.\n\nHowever, attempts to reform the House of Lords have historically been fraught with difficulty. The last major effort, under the coalition government in 2012, was abandoned due to opposition from Conservative backbenchers.\n\nLord Kinnock will argue that reform is not only necessary but also achievable. \"We have seen significant changes in our political system in recent years, from the devolution of powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to the introduction of elected mayors in cities across England,\" he will say. \"There is no reason why we cannot also modernise the House of Lords.\"\n\nThe former Labour leader will also call for a more diverse House of Lords, with better representation of women, ethnic minorities, and people from different regions and backgrounds.\n\nThe government has said it is committed to reducing the size of the House of Lords, but has not yet set out detailed plans for how this will be achieved. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said: \"We welcome contributions to the debate on Lords reform, and will consider Lord Kinnock's proposals carefully.\"\n\nLord Kinnock's speech is likely to reignite the debate on the future of the House of Lords, and could put pressure on the government to set out its own plans for reform.",
    "Former Wales international Mike Ruddock has thrown his support behind prop John Yapp, stating that he believes the player has the credentials to make a significant impact in the rugby world.\n\nRuddock, who coached Wales to a Grand Slam in 2005, has been impressed with Yapp's performances and believes he has the potential to become a key player for the national team.\n\n\"John has shown great promise,\" Ruddock said. \"He's got the physicality, the skill set and the mindset to really make a mark in the game. I've been impressed with his work ethic and his determination to improve.\"\n\nYapp, 26, has been a standout performer for his club, Cardiff Blues, and has already earned 21 caps for Wales. However, he has often been overlooked for the starting line-up in favour of more experienced players.\n\nRuddock believes that Yapp's time to shine on the international stage is imminent. \"He's been knocking on the door for a while now,\" he said. \"I think he's ready to step up and show what he's capable of.\"\n\nThe former coach also praised Yapp's versatility, noting that he can play on both sides of the scrum, a rare trait in modern rugby. \"That's a huge asset,\" Ruddock said. \"It gives the coach more options and it's a testament to John's skill and adaptability.\"\n\nRuddock's endorsement comes as a significant boost for Yapp, who has been working hard to establish himself as a regular in the Wales squad. With the Six Nations tournament on the horizon, Yapp will be hoping to prove his worth and secure his place in the team.\n\n\"John has all the attributes to succeed at the highest level,\" Ruddock concluded. \"I have no doubt that he will continue to develop and become a key player for Wales in the future.\"",
    "The rate of personal computer (PC) ownership is expected to double by the year 2010, according to a comprehensive study by market research firm IDC.\n\nThe firm predicts that in less than six years, over one billion people will own PCs across the globe. This anticipated growth is being fuelled by emerging markets in India, China, Brazil, and Russia. These countries have exhibited a burgeoning middle-class population and an increasing demand for technology and internet access.\n\nIndia and China alone are expected to account for approximately 80 million new PC users by 2010. Other nations such as Brazil and Russia, renowned for their developing digital economies, will contribute significantly in bolstering these statistics.\n\n\"As these countries continue to integrate technology into their society and economy, demand for PCs will surge,\" said Randy Giusto, vice president of IDC's personal technology and services research. \"It's a huge opportunity for technology and PC manufacturers.\"\n\nAnother factor driving the surge in PC ownership is the decrease in costs. “Computers are becoming more affordable. This, combined with, increasing internet penetration and digitisation of various services, is driving the demand,” stated Giusto.\n\nThe report also forecasts dramatic increases in PC-related electronic waste due to this anticipated PC boom. While the benefits of this increase in PC ownership are clear, there are concerns about the environmental impact of disposing of these PCs when they become outdated.\n\nGiusto commented, \"Electronic waste is a growing concern as the turnover of devices increases.\" He further suggested that tech companies should focus on creating sustainable technology with a longer lifespan, or risk contributing to a global electronic waste problem.\n\nDespite the environmental concerns, the prospect of double PC-ownership by 2010 is expected to bring new advancements in global connectivity, digital literacy, and economic growth. Manufacturers are eager to tap into this burgeoning market, and consumers are excited for the increased access to information this growth will provide. \n\nIt seems the rapid growth of the digital age is only just beginning.",
    "Sri Lanka's banking sector is bracing for a metaphorical tsunami, as the country's economic crisis deepens, with experts predicting a surge in bad loans and a potential liquidity crunch.\n\nThe island nation, known for its tea and tourism, is grappling with a severe foreign exchange crisis, high inflation, and a sharp contraction in its economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The situation has been further exacerbated by the government's decision to halt debt repayments to international creditors for six months.\n\nAnalysts warn that these factors are creating a perfect storm for the banking sector, which is already under pressure from a rise in non-performing loans and a slowdown in credit growth.\n\n\"The banking sector is facing a tsunami of bad loans,\" said Ravi Kumar, a senior economist at Colombo-based think tank, the Centre for Economic Research. \"The economic downturn, coupled with the government's decision to suspend debt repayments, is likely to lead to a significant increase in defaults.\"\n\nSri Lanka's central bank has already taken steps to shore up the banking sector, including reducing interest rates and easing capital adequacy requirements. However, some experts argue that these measures may not be enough to stave off a crisis.\n\n\"The central bank's measures are like a life jacket, but what we really need is a lifeboat,\" said Kumar. \"The banking sector needs a comprehensive rescue plan, including a mechanism to deal with the expected surge in bad loans.\"\n\nThe potential banking crisis could also have serious implications for Sri Lanka's economy, which is heavily reliant on the banking sector for investment and growth. A collapse in the banking sector could lead to a further contraction in the economy, exacerbating the country's economic woes.\n\nThe government, for its part, has sought to downplay concerns about the banking sector. In a statement, the Ministry of Finance said that the country's banks are \"well-capitalised and have sufficient liquidity to weather the current economic challenges.\"\n\nHowever, many analysts remain sceptical. \"The government's reassurances are not enough,\" said Kumar. \"We need concrete action to prevent a banking crisis.\"\n\nAs the economic storm continues to brew, the people of Sri Lanka can only hope that their banks are prepared to weather the tsunami that is predicted to hit.",
    "London-based Wembley plc has made an unexpected announcement revealing that the company will not be generating a profit this financial year. The revelation came as a surprise to investors and industry analysts who had projected a profitable year for the events management institution that had previously always maintained an upward trajectory.\n\nWembley plc, which manages the Wembley Stadium and Wembley Arena, is one of the foremost companies in event management providing locals and tourists with unforgettable entertainment experiences. Despite the company’s robust portfolio that includes globally recognised celebrities and internationally acclaimed events, the company has still faced a significant downturn.\n\nWhilst industry experts predicted a minor slump due to the ongoing pandemic affecting global tourism and events, the declaration of no profits came as a severe shock. Wembley's spokesperson stated that health restrictions had hit the company harder than anticipated which led to the cancellation of concerts, sports games and other large-scale events.\n\nThe spokesperson also highlighted that Wembley plc had to bear massive unforeseen expenses due to the modification of their operations to fit government guidelines. Wembley had to spend a significant amount on seating obstructions and additional sanitation precautions to guarantee safety, and this increased operational cost has now eaten at their profits.\n\nAnalysts believe no profit in the current financial year could potentially strain the company's cash flow and might force Wembley plc to balance its books either by laying off staff or securing liquidity through bank loans, bonds or selling assets.\n\nThe news of Wembley's financial struggle comes at a time when many businesses are grappling with losses due to the ongoing global crises caused by the pandemic. The entertainment and hospitality sectors, in particular, have been hit hardest thanks to forced cancellations and lockdowns, with many once-thriving powerhouses now teetering on the brink of solvency.\n\nThe surprising news from a stable company like Wembley plc underscores the seriousness of the current economic climate, and the potential for broader economic repercussions still looms large. With us not even halfway through the year, only time will tell if and how this cherished company, like many others, will find a way to navigate the choppy waters of these uncertain times.",
    "The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has unequivocally denied recent rumours that the classic British sitcom, 'Blackadder', is set for a television comeback.\n\nSpeculation has been rife within the industry and among dedicated fans of the show since actor Sir Tony Robinson, who portrayed the character Baldrick in the historical comedy, suggested a new series could be on the horizon during an interview last week. However, the BBC insists there are no plans to revive the iconic series.\n\nIn a brief statement, a BBC spokesperson said, \"Whilst we love the unforgettable sitcom, Blackadder, as much as our audiences do, we have no current plans to bring the show back for a fifth series.\"\n\nBlackadder was a staple of British television and gained a considerable global following from the early '80s to the late '90s. The series centred on the ill-fated antics of the scheming Edmund Blackadder, played by Rowan Atkinson, across various historical periods. It also saw performances from a host of celebrated British actors, including Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Miranda Richardson and Rik Mayall.\n\nThe show was widely popular for its clever puns and sarcastic humour intelligently woven into historical contexts. The last series, 'Blackadder Goes Forth', which depicted the trench warfare of the First World War, concluded poignantly on a sombre note, with its main characters going \"over the top\" into No Man's Land.\n\nThe refusal to confirm a reboot comes amidst a trend of popular shows such as 'Friends', 'Frasier' and 'The Office' either returning or being rebooted for nostalgic fans.\n\nReacting to this refusal, some fans expressed their disappointment on social media, with many stating that they had been looking forward to the potential return of the cunning Blackadder and his hilariously dim-witted sidekick, Baldrick. Others, however, agreed with the BBC's decision, fearing that a revival could tarnish the original show's perfect ending.\n\nFor now, it seems fans of the quick-witted Edmund Blackadder will need to satisfy their cravings with reruns of the original four series and occasional Christmas specials, available on streaming services.",
    "Former Chelsea striker Adrian Mutu is set to hold talks with Italian giants Juventus over a potential move. The Romanian international, who is currently plying his trade with French side Ajaccio, is reportedly keen on a return to Italy.\n\nMutu, 34, has had a colourful career, with spells at Inter Milan, Parma and Fiorentina in Italy, as well as a controversial stint at Chelsea in the English Premier League. His time in England was marred by a positive test for cocaine use, which led to a seven-month ban from football and his eventual departure from Chelsea.\n\nDespite his off-field issues, Mutu has remained a potent force on the pitch. He scored 17 goals in 32 appearances for Ajaccio last season, proving that he still has the ability to perform at the highest level.\n\nJuventus, who won the Serie A title last season, are believed to be interested in adding Mutu to their attacking options. The Turin-based club already boasts a formidable forward line, including the likes of Carlos Tevez and Fernando Llorente, but manager Antonio Conte is reportedly keen to add more depth to his squad.\n\nThe talks between Mutu and Juventus are expected to take place in the coming days. If a deal is agreed, it would mark a remarkable return to the top of Italian football for Mutu, who left Fiorentina in 2011 amidst a cloud of controversy.\n\nHowever, any potential move would likely hinge on Mutu's ability to prove his fitness and commitment. The striker has struggled with injuries in recent years, and Juventus will be keen to ensure that he is in the right physical and mental state to contribute to their title defence.\n\nMutu's agent, Giovanni Becali, confirmed the planned talks, saying: \"Adrian is interested in the move and we will be meeting with Juventus to discuss the possibility. He still has a lot to offer and is eager to return to Italy.\"\n\nThe potential move would also offer Mutu a chance to play in the UEFA Champions League once again, a competition in which he has previously excelled. With Juventus aiming to compete on multiple fronts next season, the experience and goal-scoring ability of Mutu could prove invaluable.",

Sir John Manzoni, who was previously the chief executive of the Civil Service and Permanent Secretary, has been recognised for his services to the Civil Service.\n\nSir John was embroiled in a controversy over the fast-tracking of visa applications for foreign investors, which led to calls for his resignation. Despite the controversy, he continued to serve in his role until his retirement in 2020.\n\nThe knighthood was announced as part of the Queen's Birthday Honours list. The list recognises the achievements and service of extraordinary people across the United Kingdom. \n\nSir John joined the Civil Service in 2014, following a successful career in the private sector. He was appointed as the first-ever chief executive of the Civil Service in 2015, a role he held for five years. During his tenure, he was responsible for the day-to-day running of the Civil Service and the delivery of the government's policies and priorities.\n\nDespite the visa row, Sir John was praised for his leadership during a period of significant change and challenge for the Civil Service. He played a key role in driving forward the modernisation and reform of the Civil Service, improving its efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nReacting to the news of his knighthood, Sir John said he was \"deeply honoured\" to receive the recognition. He added: \"I have always believed in the importance of public service and I am proud of what we have achieved in the Civil Service over the past few years.\"\n\nThe decision to knight Sir John has been met with criticism from some quarters, with critics arguing that it sends the wrong message following the visa controversy. However, supporters argue that his overall contribution to the Civil Service should not be overshadowed by one incident.\n\nThe Cabinet Office has defended the decision, stating that the honour recognises Sir John's \"significant contribution to public life\". They added that the knighthood was \"fully deserved\" and reflected his \"outstanding service to the Civil Service and the wider public sector\".\n\nSir John's knighthood is one of several high-profile honours announced by the Queen, including awards for key figures in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "Thousands of ballot papers for the upcoming assembly elections have reportedly gone missing, sparking concerns over the integrity of the electoral process. The Electoral Commission has launched an investigation into the matter, promising to take stringent action against those found guilty of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe missing ballot papers were intended for use in several constituencies across the country. The exact number of missing papers is yet to be confirmed, but initial estimates suggest it could be in the thousands. The incident came to light when local election officials reported a discrepancy in the number of ballot papers received and those recorded as dispatched by the printing press.\n\nThe Electoral Commission has assured voters that the missing ballot papers will not impact the upcoming assembly elections. \"We have robust systems in place to deal with such incidents. Additional ballot papers will be printed and dispatched to the affected constituencies,\" a spokesperson for the commission said.\n\nHowever, the incident has raised concerns among political parties and voters about the potential for electoral fraud. Some parties have called for an independent inquiry into the matter, expressing fears that the missing ballot papers could be used to manipulate the election results.\n\nThe Electoral Commission has sought to allay these fears, stating that each ballot paper carries a unique serial number, making it impossible to use the missing papers fraudulently. \"We have a stringent tracking system in place. Any attempt to use the missing ballot papers will be detected and dealt with severely,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nThe police have also been roped in to investigate the incident. They are currently examining CCTV footage from the printing press and the transportation vehicles to identify any possible foul play.\n\nThe assembly elections, scheduled to take place next month, are being closely watched as they are expected to be a litmus test for the ruling party.

    "British comic series \"Little Britain\" has topped a critic's poll for the best TV comedy of the 21st century. The list, compiled and voted upon by critics, saw Matt Lucas and David Walliams' offbeat sketch show take the prime position. \n\nLittle Britain, which debuted on BBC Three in 2003 before being promoted to BBC One, is beloved for its daring humor and memorable characters such as the deluded weight-loss leader Marjorie Dawes or the flamboyant and theatrical Sebastian Love. \n\nCritics largely attributed the show's success to its sharp comedic writing, balanced with dark humor and satirical commentary on British society and culture. The comic duo's performances, coupled with their mastery of physical comedy, helped bring to life an extensive array of comic characters who have since become iconic figures in British television humor. \n\nThe comic list saw stiff competition, with Ricky Gervais's \"The Office\" and Armando Iannucci's \"The Thick Of It\" following close behind in second and third place. Critics praised both Gervais's sharp satirical take on office cultures and Iannucci's intense satire of British politics. However, it was Little Britain, with its blend of farcical sketches, colorful characters, and social critique, that finally clinched the top spot. \n\nThe list has inevitably attracted controversy, with some arguing that comedy has evolved significantly since the early 2000s, and thus the list does not represent the contemporary comedic landscape. Critics, on the other hand, maintain that the list was designed to reflect the most influential and culturally significant comedies of the century – and that Little Britain unequivocally fits this bill.\n\nCo-star and co-creator Matt Lucas expressed his gratitude for the recognition in a Tweet saying, \"Never expected this! Big love to our fans and critics who have kept Little Britain in their hearts.\"\n\nThe impact of Little Britain on modern British comedy is undeniable; its legacy is one of pushing boundaries, challenging norms, and ultimately changing the comedic landscape. Its influence is still seen in today's comedy scene, reinforcing its rightful place at the top of this list. Despite its age, Little Britain continues to draw new audiences, demonstrating that good comedy truly is timeless.",
    "Former world number one, Lindsay Davenport, has criticised Wimbledon's scheduling and court allocation, claiming it favours male players. The three-time Grand Slam champion, who won Wimbledon in 1999, said the tournament's organisers were not treating women's matches with the same importance as men's.\n\nDavenport, now a respected tennis commentator, expressed her disappointment during a press conference. \"It's disheartening to see that women's matches are not given the same priority as men's,\" she said. \"Wimbledon needs to recognise that women's tennis is just as exciting and deserves equal representation.\"\n\nThe American pointed out that more men's matches were scheduled on the main courts, while women's matches were often relegated to the smaller courts. She also noted that men's matches were typically scheduled during prime viewing times, while women's matches were often played earlier in the day.\n\nDavenport's comments come amid growing concerns about gender inequality in tennis. Despite equal prize money being awarded at all four Grand Slam tournaments since 2007, many believe that women's tennis is still not given the same prominence as men's.\n\nWimbledon has faced criticism in the past for its scheduling. In 2017, Venus Williams' match was moved to Court 18, a decision that was widely criticised. Similarly, in 2018, only two women's matches were scheduled on Centre Court and Court One on the second Monday of the tournament, traditionally known as 'Manic Monday'.\n\nDavenport urged Wimbledon's organisers to address the issue. \"It's time for change,\" she said. \"Wimbledon is a prestigious tournament with a rich history, and it should lead by example in promoting gender equality.\"\n\nThe All England Lawn Tennis Club, which organises Wimbledon, has yet to respond to Davenport's comments. However, in the past, they have defended their scheduling, stating that it is based on a complex range of factors, including the 'box office' appeal of players, their ranking, and the need to balance the men's and women's programmes.\n\nDavenport's comments have sparked a wider debate about gender equality in tennis, with many fans and players expressing their support for her stance.

This will mark the 25th film in the long-running series that has captivated audiences worldwide for over five decades.\n\n\"Casino Royale\" is a familiar title for Bond aficionados, as it was the first novel written by Ian Fleming, introducing the world to the suave and sophisticated secret agent, James Bond. The novel was previously adapted into a 1967 satirical film and a 2006 blockbuster starring Daniel Craig in his debut as 007.\n\nEon Productions, the company behind the Bond franchise, has yet to reveal who will be stepping into the shoes of the legendary spy for this latest outing.

    "Commuters in Buenos Aires are facing severe disruption as a city-wide train strike continues to cause delays and cancellations. Tens of thousands of people seeking to go to work, school, or medical appointments are heavily affected by the ongoing labor action.\n\nThe strike, organized by the two main railway workers' unions, began on Monday in protest of poor working conditions, low pay and a lack of adequate safety measures. No immediate resolution is in sight and further strikes have not been ruled out, raising the possibility of long-term disruption.\n\nAs the largest and most populous city in Argentina, Buenos Aires relies heavily on its rail network. Every day, its trains transport around 1.3 million people in and out of the city, according to Argentina's transport ministry.\n\nHowever, the networks have been at a complete halt since the strike action began. Although the government has deployed extra buses and coaches to help alleviate the crisis, many commuters are still stranded due to overloaded public transport and traffic congestions.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, a local commuter, Maria Lopez, voiced her concern over the strike: \"I understand the workers' right to strike, but it's chaos. I can't get to work on time and it's costing me money as I have missed several working hours.\"\n\nUnion leaders insist they were forced to resort to strike action due to the government's failure to address their concerns about health and safety, as well as a fair wage. \"This is a desperate and necessary measure,\" said Ruben Sobrero, a spokesperson for one of the unions. \"We have been in negotiations for months, but with no real progress.”\n\nThe Argentine government has called the strike disproportionate and has urged the unions to reconsider their decision. The transport ministry warns that the service disruption could have a significant impact on the city’s economy, as it prevents workers and consumers from getting to their business places. In response, the ministry has pledged to look into the issue and find possible resolutions.\n\nStrikes are not unusual in Argentina; however, such a widespread action affecting critical infrastructure in Buenos Aires is rare. The strike highlights the growing tension between workers and the government in Argentina amidst rising inflation and economic crisis.\n\nAs thousands of Buenos Aires residents struggle to commute, the question remains how long the city can sustain this transportation paralysis. Until a resolution is found, Buenos Aires can expect continued transportation chaos, and residents and businesses will bear the brunt of the disruption.",
    "Paula Radcliffe, the world-renowned British long-distance runner, has once again silenced her critics with an impressive performance at the latest international marathon event. \n\nRadcliffe, who has been plagued by injuries and doubts over her form in recent years, finished the gruelling 26.2-mile race in a time that was not only a personal best but also placed her among the top finishers. \n\nThe 47-year-old athlete, who holds the women's world record for the fastest marathon time, has faced a barrage of criticism in recent years. Critics have questioned her ability to compete at the highest level, citing her age and injury history as potential hindrances. \n\nHowever, Radcliffe's latest performance has proven that she is far from finished. Her time, which she achieved despite challenging weather conditions, was faster than many of her younger competitors. \n\nSpeaking after the race, Radcliffe said, \"I've always said that age is just a number. I know what I'm capable of and I've never let the doubters get to me. Today was about proving to myself that I can still compete with the best.\"\n\nHer coach, Gary Lough, echoed her sentiments, stating, \"Paula has always been a fighter. She's had to overcome a lot of obstacles in her career, but she's never let that stop her. Today's performance is a testament to her determination and resilience.\"\n\nRadcliffe's performance has been hailed as an inspiration by fellow athletes and fans alike. Many have taken to social media to congratulate her, with some suggesting that her achievement could pave the way for older athletes in the sport.\n\nThe British runner's triumphant return to form has certainly silenced her critics, at least for now. It remains to be seen whether Radcliffe will continue to compete at this level, but one thing is clear: she has once again proven that she is a force to be reckoned with in the world of long-distance running.",
    "Thirty-two years after their last head-to-head competition on Irish soil, England's rugby team prepares to face off against Ireland this Sunday. The match is set to be a significant event in the rugby calendar, carrying considerable weight for both sides. \n\nIn their most recent meeting, England trounced Ireland 24-12 during the Six Nations Championship last February. However, Ireland has emerged this season as a strong contender, having won their last home game against England in 2019. While Eddie Jones's England side has shown a remarkable form, especially since their triumphant Autumn Nations Cup finale, Ireland also promises a powerful display under the leadership of Andy Farrell.\n\nWhile Ireland is looking to bounce back from their last defeat against England, the English squad aims to keep up the pace and cement their position further in the international ranking. This intermediate focus is part of both teams’ long-term goal - to be in their best shape for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France.\n\nIreland's starting line-up boasts of names such as Caelan Doris, who is set to return after a hamstring injury. In contrast, England welcomes back some key players, including the likes of Maro Itoje and Kyle Sinckler, who have shown excellent form this season.\n\nThe forthcoming encounter at the Aviva Stadium will also gauge the young talents from both squads, reflecting how they deal with high-intensity international matches. For the Irish team, this could entail a decisive role for players like Doris, James Lowe and Hugo Keenan. In the camp across the Irish Sea, the spotlight will undoubtedly fall on English trio Jonny Hill, Will Stuart and Ollie Lawrence. \n\nEddie Jones anticipates a tough contest. \"We know we need to be at our best to beat Ireland,\" he said. \"They're a difficult opponent who we respect greatly.\". On the other side, Andy Farrell expressed his confidence in his team, \"We have the belief and the ability to beat England. Our preparation has been good, and we are ready\".\n\nWhatever the result, Sunday's match promises board-rattling tackles, deft offloads, and a nail-biting contest between two sides determined to bring their A-game. The tensions run high, the stage is set, and rugby fans can look forward to a thrilling spectacle in Dublin this weekend.",
    "Experts warn that a nuclear strike remains high on the list of potential terror threats that the world should prepare to counter. Despite the focus on emerging domains such as cyber-terrorism, traditional threats such as nuclear attacks continue to loom large in security considerations due to the cataclysmic damage they can inflict.\n\nInternational security agencies have continuously highlighted the risk of nuclear material falling into the wrong hands. Philip Zelikow, a former director of the 9/11 Commission in the United States, insinuated that the threat of a nuclear strike is significant. In an interview with BBC, he cautioned that the risk of nuclear terrorism, while low in probability, was \"very high\" in terms of potential impact.\n\nKeeping nuclear proliferation under control remains a prime focus of security agencies worldwide. Despite international efforts led by groups such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), there is perpetual unease regarding the ability to track and maintain control over nuclear material across the globe.\n\n\"Nuclear terrorism is a serious and pressing threat,\" stated Dr Patricia Lewis, the director of the International Security Department at Chatham House. \"Securing nuclear materials to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists must be an international priority.\"\n\nExperts point to the rise of extremist groups with apocalyptic ideologies as an exacerbating factor. Such groups would be more likely to use nuclear weapons if they were able to gain access to them.\n\nAdditionally, rogue nations acquiring nuclear weapon capabilities pose a sizable threat. The international community continues to apply pressure on nations such as North Korea and Iran through sanctions and diplomatic efforts, in an attempt to prevent nuclear weapon proliferation.\n\nDespite advancements in technology enabling better detection and control of nuclear materials, there are still calls for a heightened focus on nuclear security. Experts suggest that the international community needs to enforce stricter regulations and invest in additional resources to combat this threat effectively.\n\nIn the meantime, the revival of Cold War-era diplomacy strategies has been discussed as a possible way to keep rising tensions in check. Such strategies could involve direct dialogue between nations and intentional efforts to improve mutual understanding of one another's security fears and ambitions, reducing the risk of miscalculations leading to potentially devastating conflicts.\n\nHowever, with the shifting dynamics of power and rising nationalism across the globe, experts argue that complacency is undesired. Attention, they suggest, should be given to both traditional and emerging threats to maintain a comprehensive view of global security. The world should remain proactive in dealing with nuclear terrorism, refusing to dismiss it as a relic of a bygone era.\n",
    "Cybersecurity experts have warned that malicious web links are playing a significant role in the spread of computer viruses, putting both individuals and businesses at risk. \n\nThese toxic web links, often hidden in seemingly harmless emails or text messages, can infect devices with malware, ransomware, or other types of harmful software. Once clicked, these links can give hackers access to sensitive information, including bank details and personal data.\n\nAccording to a recent report by cybersecurity firm, Cybereason, there has been a significant increase in the number of these malicious links over the past year. The report suggests that the shift to remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to this rise, as hackers exploit vulnerabilities in home networks and less secure devices.\n\n\"Working from home has blurred the lines between personal and professional use of technology,\" said Lior Div, CEO of Cybereason. \"This has created new opportunities for cybercriminals to infiltrate networks and access sensitive data.\"\n\nThe report also highlighted that these toxic links are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often mimicking legitimate websites or services to trick users into clicking on them. This technique, known as phishing, is a common method used by cybercriminals to steal personal information.\n\nIn response to this growing threat, cybersecurity experts are urging individuals and businesses to take preventative measures. These include regularly updating software, using strong and unique passwords, and being cautious of any unexpected or suspicious emails or messages.\n\n\"Education is key in preventing these attacks,\" said Div. \"Users need to be aware of the risks and know how to spot potential threats. Businesses should also invest in robust cybersecurity measures and ensure their employees are adequately trained.\"\n\nThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has also issued guidance on how to stay safe online. It recommends using two-factor authentication where possible, regularly backing up data, and reporting any suspicious activity.\n\nAs the digital landscape continues to evolve, the threat posed by toxic web links and other forms of cybercrime is likely to increase. It is therefore crucial that individuals and businesses remain vigilant and take the necessary steps to protect themselves online.",
    "A freshly launched web browser is gaining rapid popularity among internet users across the globe due to its unprecedented speed and privacy features.\n\nThe new browser, known as 'Cyber Falcon', has successfully carved out a sizable chunk of the online market share since its launch a few weeks ago. Developed by TechGenius, the firm who introduced popular apps like 'Safe Shield' and 'Efficiency Master', the browser is set to revolutionise our digital surfing experience.\n\n\"The impetus was to create a browser that's incredibly fast and places a major emphasis on privacy, two areas we felt were being overlooked,\" revealed Brad Kent, founder and CEO of TechGenius.\n\nIn an increasingly digitalised world, online protection has become paramount. Cyber Falcon’s security-driven aspects appear to be striking a chord with users. Its default settings block any 'third-party trackers', enabling a more secure and private browsing experience. Furthermore, the browser's integrated ad and pop-up blockers effectively prevent interruptions, making the surfing process more seamless.\n\nA huge selling point for the web-surfing tool lies in its speed. Independent tests have shown that Cyber Falcon actually outpaces established rivals such as Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox by a significant margin.\n\n\"This is a game-changer,\" comments tech analyst Linda Morris. \"There's not a lot that differentiates one browser from another, but Cyber Falcon has managed to do just that with settings enhancing both speed and privacy.\"\n\nWhile it has made an initial impact, critics argue that the real test will be maintaining the momentum. They believe the company will need to consistently provide updates and address concerns to keep users engaged, as well as continue innovating to meet evolving user needs. However, TechGenius expresses confidence in their latest creation, declaring that they have further upgrades in the pipeline.\n\nApart from its speed and security features, Cyber Falcon also boasts the ability to customise the interface design and colour schemes. It’s an aspect rarely seen in other browsers and seems to be attracting a wider range of users, including visually-oriented and younger audiences.\n\nThe success of Cyber Falcon comes at a crucial time for the web browsing industry, which has been stagnant, with only a few big players dominating the market. Many hope that the arrival of this new browser might fuel a healthy competitive environment, ultimately providing users with the best surfing experience possible. \n\nAs Cyber Falcon continues to gain popularity, it remains to be seen if this new player can bring long-awaited innovation and transform the way we browse the internet.",
    "A high-profile banker has lost a sexism claim against his former employer, following a judgement made by an employment tribunal in London.\n\nMr. James Hunt, who had lodged a case against the globally acclaimed banking firm, Bank of Pearl, stating he was a victim of gender discrimination, saw his claim dismissed due to insufficient evidence.\n\nIn his case, Mr. Hunt had claimed he was unfairly overlooked for promotions and pay rises, which he believed were instead awarded to lesser-qualified female colleagues as part of the bank's strategy to appear more gender-diverse. He had argued that his performance was never a question, having consistently been among the top performers across departments.\n\nBank of Pearl, however, responded that promotions and pay decisions were made solely based on merit and potential, with gender playing no role in their decision-making processes. They further highlighted that Mr. Hunt's career progression had not been stalled, but was in line with his performance ratings within the organisation.\n\nThe panel, comprising three judges, found that the evidence presented did not substantiate claims of gender discrimination, concluding that the bank had displayed no bias in their practices. They indicated that Mr. Hunt had failed to provide sufficient proof to support his claim that he had been overlooked due to his gender.\n\nFollowing the judgement, Bank of Pearl issued a statement expressing their commitment to equal employment opportunities. It read: \"We are pleased with the outcome of the tribunal. It reinforces our dedication towards ensuring a fair and unbiased working environment, irrespective of gender.\"\n\nThe bank also emphasised its continuing efforts to foster diversity and inclusion across all levels, stating it had targets and programs in place to help build a balanced workforce.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Hunt expressed his disappointment with the judgement but emphasised that he respects the decision of the tribunal.\n\nThe case has brought to light the complexities surrounding issues of gender equality and discrimination in the banking industry. It also raises questions around the sector's attempts to improve gender diversity, which, while necessary, might lead to perceptions of positive discrimination.\n\nThe case follows a series of high-profile gender discrimination cases against large multinational banks. Most notably, Stacey Macken won a claim against BNP Paribas for unequal pay and sexist behaviour. Meanwhile, many other banks and companies across various sectors are still grappling with how to improve their gender balance and address disparities without causing further discontent.",
    "The internet, as we know it, is set to undergo a significant transformation as plans to roll out the next generation's net are underway. This new wave of internet technology promises to revolutionise the way we connect, communicate, and consume digital content.\n\nThe next generation's net, often referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT), is a network of physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity. These devices collect and exchange data, allowing them to interact and cooperate with each other to reach common goals.\n\nThe IoT is expected to connect billions of devices worldwide, creating a global network of 'smart' devices. This will not only change the way we live and work but also has the potential to significantly impact various sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, and manufacturing.\n\nIn healthcare, for instance, the IoT could enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems. Doctors could monitor patients' vital signs in real-time, reducing the need for hospital visits and potentially saving lives. In agriculture, farmers could use IoT devices to monitor crop conditions and automate irrigation systems, leading to increased efficiency and productivity.\n\nHowever, the roll-out of the next generation's net is not without its challenges. One of the main concerns is data security. With billions of devices connected to the internet, the risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks increases significantly. Therefore, robust security measures will be crucial to protect sensitive data and maintain user trust.\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of standardisation in IoT devices. Currently, there is no universal standard for how these devices should communicate with each other. This could lead to compatibility issues and hinder the full potential of the IoT.\n\nDespite these challenges, the roll-out of the next generation's net is an exciting prospect. It represents a significant leap forward in internet technology and has the potential to transform our lives in ways we can't even imagine yet.\n\nAs we move towards this new era of connectivity, it's clear that the internet is no longer just a network of computers. It's becoming a network of everything, connecting us in ways we never thought possible. The next generation's net is on the horizon, and it promises to be a game-changer.",
    "The leader of the Conservative Party has unveiled a comprehensive spending plan, outlining the party's fiscal strategy for the coming years. The plan, which prioritises investment in public services, infrastructure, and green initiatives, is being hailed as a blueprint for a post-pandemic economic recovery.\n\nThe Tory leader emphasised the need for fiscal responsibility while also acknowledging the necessity of targeted spending to stimulate economic growth. The plan includes significant investment in the NHS, education, and law enforcement, as well as a commitment to increase spending on infrastructure and green initiatives.\n\n\"We recognise the need to balance the books, but we also understand the importance of investing in our public services and infrastructure to ensure a robust recovery from the pandemic,\" the Tory leader said during the announcement.\n\nThe spending plan includes a £20 billion increase in NHS funding over the next four years, a move that the Tory leader said was necessary to ensure the health service can continue to provide high-quality care. The plan also includes a £14 billion investment in education, with a focus on improving schools in disadvantaged areas.\n\nIn addition, the plan outlines a £10 billion investment in law enforcement, aimed at recruiting more police officers and improving community safety. The Tory leader also announced a £12 billion investment in green initiatives, including renewable energy projects and measures to improve energy efficiency in homes and businesses.\n\nThe spending plan has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters argue that it strikes the right balance between fiscal responsibility and necessary investment, while critics suggest it does not go far enough in addressing social inequality and climate change.\n\nThe Labour Party criticised the plan, arguing that it fails to address the root causes of social inequality. \"This is a plan that tinkers around the edges, but fails to address the deep-seated issues that have led to rising inequality and poverty,\" a Labour spokesperson said.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental groups have welcomed the investment in green initiatives, but argue that more needs to be done to tackle climate change. \"While this investment is a step in the right direction, it falls short of the ambitious action needed to address the climate crisis,\" said a spokesperson for Greenpeace.\n\nThe Tory leader defended the plan, arguing that it represents a balanced approach to economic recovery. \"This is a plan that invests in our public services, supports economic growth, and takes significant steps towards a greener future,\" they said. \"We believe this is the right approach for our country at this time.\"\n\nThe spending plan will now be debated in Parliament, with a vote expected in the coming weeks.",
    "The future of the gaming industry could be challenging, according to industry experts. They warn that game companies may struggle to maintain profitability in the face of increasing competition, rising development costs, and changing consumer habits.\n\nThe gaming industry has seen a boom in recent years, with the global market estimated to be worth $159.3 billion in 2020, according to Newzoo, a gaming analytics company. However, the landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with new entrants and tech giants like Google and Amazon entering the fray.\n\nThe cost of developing games is also on the rise. AAA games, the industry's blockbusters, can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop, not including marketing and distribution costs. This has led to a trend of consolidation in the industry, with larger companies acquiring smaller studios to spread the risk and cost.\n\nChanging consumer habits also pose a challenge. The rise of mobile gaming has disrupted the traditional console and PC gaming market. Meanwhile, the advent of cloud gaming could further change the landscape, allowing players to stream games directly to their devices without the need for expensive hardware.\n\nThe shift towards a 'games as a service' model, where players pay a subscription fee to access a library of games, is another potential hurdle. While this model can provide a steady stream of revenue, it also requires companies to continually produce new content to keep players engaged.\n\nDespite these challenges, some industry insiders remain optimistic. They argue that the gaming industry has always been dynamic and that companies that can adapt to these changes will thrive.\n\n\"The gaming industry is no stranger to evolution,\" said James Dean, CEO of esports company ESL UK. \"Those who can innovate and adapt to the changing market conditions will continue to succeed.\"\n\nHowever, others warn that the industry could face a shake-up. \"The gaming industry is at a crossroads,\" said Piers Harding-Rolls, a gaming analyst at Ampere Analysis. \"Companies that fail to adapt to the changing landscape could find themselves left behind.\"\n\nThe future of the gaming industry may be uncertain, but one thing is clear: game companies will need to navigate a rapidly changing landscape if they want to secure their place in the future of entertainment.",
    "Japan's economy has slipped into recession for the first time in four and a half years, following a decrease in domestic consumption and exports due to the global coronavirus outbreak, according to government data.\n\nThe world's third-largest economy shrank at an annual rate of 3.4% in the first quarter of 2020, its second consecutive quarter of contraction. The last time Japan's economy suffered such a sustained fall was between the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. \n\nA significant factor contributing to this decline is the drastic decrease in consumption which accounts for more than half of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP). Consumer spending fell 0.7% in the first three months of this year, after a rise in sales tax last October led to a decrease by 2.9% in the last quarter of 2019; both served so as to negatively impact the economy. \n\nAdditionally, the delay of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, which was expected to boost Japan's economy, has contributed to the recession. The postponement is estimated to result in a direct loss of at least $6 billion, according to economists. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has delivered a significant blow to the world economy, and Japan has not been spared. Global demand for Japanese goods and services has shrunk, with exports falling by 0.5% for the quarter.\n\n\"The coronavirus pandemic is having a substantial impact on our domestic spending and exports,\" said a senior government official. \"We're likely to see even worse figures in the April-June period.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the government is implementing a $1 trillion stimulus package in an effort to mitigate the economic damage. However, some fear it might be insufficient given the vast uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nOn top of the ongoing pandemic, Japan also faces long-standing economic challenges such as a rapidly ageing population and low productivity. Experts predict that the country's economy could contract by an annual rate of over 20% in the second quarter - making the road to recovery a monumental and challenging task. \n\nThis is a harsh warning to countries around the globe, underlining the harsh reality that even the world's biggest economies are not immune from the economic fallout of this pandemic.",
    "Former world number one, Jennifer Capriati, has announced that she will not be participating in the upcoming Australian Open in Melbourne due to health concerns. The three-time Grand Slam champion has been struggling with a persistent shoulder injury that has kept her off the court for the majority of the past season.\n\nCapriati, 34, has been battling the injury since her last appearance at a major tournament in 2004. Despite intensive rehabilitation and therapy, the American tennis star has been unable to fully recover and regain her previous form.\n\n\"I'm really disappointed to have to miss the Australian Open,\" Capriati said in a statement. \"This is a tournament that holds a lot of great memories for me, including winning the title in 2001 and 2002. But my health has to come first, and at this point, I need to focus on getting fully fit again.\"\n\nThe Australian Open, which is set to begin in January, will be the first Grand Slam of the year. Capriati's absence will be a significant blow to the tournament, as she has always been a crowd favourite in Melbourne.\n\nCapriati turned professional at the age of 13 and quickly rose to prominence in the tennis world. She won her first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in 2001, and followed it up with a successful defence of her title the following year. She also won the French Open in 2001.\n\nDespite her success, Capriati's career has been plagued by injuries and off-court issues. She took a break from tennis in the mid-1990s before making a successful comeback in 2001.\n\nCapriati's withdrawal from the Australian Open follows a series of injury-related pullouts from top players in recent years, raising concerns about the physical demands of the professional tennis circuit.\n\nThe tennis world will undoubtedly miss Capriati's competitive spirit and tenacity on the court in Melbourne.

Head Coach Wayne Pivac noted, \"There's a great deal of swagger in the Welsh camp at the moment, and we're heading into the Scotland match with boosted confidence\".\n\nA Grand Slam win, which awards the team that beats all others in the Six Nations, would undoubtedly be a significant boost for Welsh rugby, following a challenging year dominated by the global pandemic. Not only would it represent a sporting triumph but also, it would serve as a beacon of hope for thousands of rugby enthusiasts across the Celtic nations, who have been eagerly following the tournament from the confines of their homes.\n\nWelsh captain Alun Wyn Jones exuded confidence ahead of the forthcoming games, stating that the team is focused on consistency and performance. \"If we can match the intensity and commitment that we've shown so far, I believe we are certainly capable of achieving the Grand Slam,” he said.\n\nThe anticipation among fans has risen in recent weeks, particularly in Wales, where rugby is deeply woven into the national fabric.

    "Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed optimism about a growing consensus between the UK and the US under the leadership of President George W. Bush. Blair, who has been a staunch ally of the US, believes that the two nations are finding more common ground on key global issues.\n\nIn a recent interview, Blair stated that he sees a \"greater understanding\" between the two nations on issues such as climate change, international terrorism, and global economic stability. He also noted that the relationship between the UK and the US has always been strong, but he believes it has become even more robust under President Bush's administration.\n\nBlair's comments come at a time when the UK and the US are working closely together on several international fronts. The two nations have been leading efforts to combat terrorism, with a particular focus on the Middle East. They have also been at the forefront of discussions on climate change, pushing for more ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHowever, Blair's comments have also sparked some controversy. Critics argue that the former Prime Minister is too closely aligned with the Bush administration, and that this has led to the UK being drawn into conflicts such as the Iraq war. They also question whether the UK's close relationship with the US is in the best interests of the country.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Blair remains steadfast in his belief that a strong relationship with the US is vital for the UK. He argues that the two nations share many common values and interests, and that working together is the best way to tackle global challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, Blair's comments highlight the ongoing debate about the nature of the UK-US relationship. While some see it as a vital alliance, others question whether it is in the UK's best interests. Regardless of these differing views, it is clear that the relationship between the two nations will continue to play a key role in global affairs.",
    "As the world becomes increasingly digital, the realm of politics is no longer confined to traditional platforms. Online games are emerging as a new frontier for political discourse, engagement, and even activism. \n\nIn recent years, we have seen a surge in the use of online games as platforms for political expression. From the virtual protests in Activision Blizzard's World of Warcraft to the campaign events held in Nintendo's Animal Crossing, the intersection of gaming and politics is becoming more pronounced.\n\nThe trend is not limited to the West. In Hong Kong, protesters used the popular online game, Animal Crossing, to express their dissent against the controversial national security law. Similarly, in Belarus, players of World of Warcraft staged a virtual protest against the disputed presidential election.\n\nThe use of online games as political platforms is not without controversy. Some argue that games should remain a space for escapism, free from the contentious world of politics. However, others contend that games, like any other form of media, are inherently political and can serve as powerful tools for political engagement.\n\nThe rise of online gaming as a political platform also raises questions about regulation. In China, for instance, the government has imposed strict rules on online gaming content, banning anything that threatens \"national unity\" or \"social stability\". This has led to concerns about censorship and the suppression of free speech.\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential of online games as platforms for political engagement is undeniable. They offer a unique space for dialogue and debate, allowing players to engage with complex political issues in a way that is interactive and immersive.\n\nMoreover, online games can reach a demographic that is often disengaged from traditional politics. According to a report by the Entertainment Software Association, 65% of American adults play video games, with the average age of players being 35. This suggests that online games could be a powerful tool for engaging younger audiences in political discourse.\n\nAs we move further into the digital age, the intersection of online gaming and politics is likely to become even more significant.

I had a high-definition video file that I wanted to convert to a different format for a project I'm working on, but whenever I tried starting the conversion process, I kept getting an error message on my screen indicating that \"the server was not powerful enough.\"\n\nI am using a pretty decent server that typically handles video-rendering tasks without any issues. It's set up with a quad-core processor, 16GB of RAM, and more than enough storage. I thought this would be sufficient for any video conversion needs, but apparently, there's something missing.\n\nThe video I'm trying to convert is about 2 hours long and in 4K resolution. The converter tool I’m using is one that I've used a lot in the past without encountering any problem whatsoever. It’s been updated to the latest version as well.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has encountered this issue before and could possibly shed some light on it. Do you think the problem lies with the software or is it a hardware limitation? Any help or suggestions you might have would be thoroughly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
    "I'm currently a full-time college student and recently took up a part-time nannying job. I love the kids and the job, but I'm finding it a bit challenging to balance my school work, classes, and the nannying job. \n\nMy classes are mostly in the morning and early afternoon, and I nanny in the late afternoon until evening. I thought this schedule would work out perfectly, but I'm finding it hard to find time to study, do homework, and just have some time for myself. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation and how you managed to balance everything. I don't want to quit the job because I genuinely enjoy it and the extra income is helpful. But I also don't want my grades to suffer because I'm not able to dedicate enough time to my studies. \n\nAny tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. How do you manage your time effectively? Are there any strategies that worked for you? Thanks in advance!",
    "I know this might sound strange, but I've always had a form of synesthesia where I can 'taste' light. It's hard to explain, but different types of light have different 'flavors' to me. The lights in my apartment currently have a stale, sterile taste that I find quite unpleasant. \n\nThey're just standard LED bulbs, nothing fancy. I've tried switching to different brands, but they all have the same bland taste. I've also tried adjusting the color temperature, but it doesn't seem to make much difference. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone else with synesthesia has experienced something similar and can suggest a type of light bulb or lighting setup that has a more pleasant 'taste'. I'm open to any suggestions, whether it's a different type of bulb, a lamp with a certain type of shade, or even a specific brand of light bulb. \n\nI know this is a bit of an odd request, but I figured if anyone would understand, it would be the Reddit community. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!",
    "Hello everyone! I thought I'd share a little bit about my journey going from complete dedication to absolutely nothing. I want to get my story out there, in hopes that someone might be going through something similar and won't feel quite so alone. \n\nSo it all began when I threw myself into something headlong and with full force, hardly leaving myself any time to breathe. I was doing this for 9 months straight, 4-5 times a week with no break. I figured it was just determination and passion that was pushing me forward. Little did I know, I was pushing my limits way too far.\n\nBurnout. That's what they call it. I didn't recognize it back then, not until it knocked me off my feet and forced me to look closely at what I was doing to myself. So, after those gruelling 9 months, I quit. Cold turkey. Enough was enough. \n\nI became a hermit of sorts for the next 2 years, hardly participating in the thing that once took up most of my time and energy. I struggled with guilt and withdrawal, but I realized that I needed this time for myself. The break allowed me to reassess my priorities, learn to pace myself and understand the importance of self-care.\n\nNow, I’m considering getting back into it but with a more balanced approach. I’ve learned my lesson the hard way and don't want to fall back into the trap of overexertion. But the truth is, I’m also pretty daunted at the prospect of going back. \n\nI’d love to hear about how others have tackled this dilemma, if you've faced it. Do you have any advice? How do you maintain balance while pursuing something you're passionate about? Any comments or insights will be much appreciated!",
    "I've been dealing with some issues lately that I'm hoping someone here might have some insight on. I've been on HRT for about two years now and have been dilating for about a year and a half. Recently, I've noticed that I've been having some issues with incontinence. It's not severe, but it's definitely noticeable and it's starting to affect my daily life.\n\nI've been trying to figure out if this is related to dilation or if it's something else entirely. I've been doing some research and I've seen some people suggest that dilation can cause incontinence, but I haven't been able to find any definitive answers. \n\nI'm planning on talking to my doctor about this, but I wanted to see if anyone here has had a similar experience or has any advice. I'm really hoping that this is something that can be resolved because it's starting to really impact my quality of life. \n\nAny advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
    "Last week I had a somewhat heated disagreement with a girl I had been talking to for a while. Our communication was kind of seamless before and we had a good balance of initiating conversations. However, ever since we had the argument, I've noticed that she won't initiate a conversation anymore. It's always me who has to text first. This doesn't sit well with me because it feels rather one-sided.\n\nDuring our argument, our voices never raised and it ended with an agreement to disagree, although feelings were evidently hurt on both sides. It wasn't of course a dispute of 'deal-breaker' magnitude. I've since apologized to her, acknowledging where I might have been wrong and she accepted my apology.\n\nThough, ever since the argument, like I said, it's always me that starts the conversations, something that didn’t happen before. It's making me really anxious and unhappy. Has anyone faced a similar situation or has any advice on what to do moving forward? Could this be her way of expressing her hurt or remaining anger? Please share your insights!",
    "I've been watching The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and I'm having a hard time relating to the Flagsmashers. I understand that they're supposed to represent a group of people who are disillusioned with the current state of the world and are fighting for a cause they believe in. However, their methods and ideology seem too extreme and misguided to me.\n\nFirstly, their goal of a world without borders seems unrealistic and oversimplified. While I agree that nationalism can lead to division and conflict, completely eradicating borders would likely lead to chaos and anarchy. It's a complex issue that can't be solved with a simple \"no borders\" solution.\n\nSecondly, their use of violence to achieve their goals is troubling. They seem to have no qualms about killing innocent people to further their cause, which is a huge red flag. It's hard to sympathize with a group that uses such ruthless tactics.\n\nLastly, their leader, Karli Morgenthau, is difficult to empathize with. While she's clearly passionate about her cause, her actions often come across as reckless and impulsive. She seems more interested in causing destruction than actually finding a peaceful solution to the problems she's fighting against.\n\nI'm curious to hear other people's thoughts on this. Do you find the Flagsmashers relatable? If so, why?",
    "So, I've been playing this game for a while now and I've just noticed something that's been bugging me about enemy sight. It seems like the enemies can spot me from miles away, even when I'm crouched and hidden behind objects. \n\nI've tested this out in various scenarios and it's pretty consistent. I could be behind a wall or a large rock, completely out of sight, but the moment I move, they're instantly alerted to my presence. It's like they have some sort of sixth sense or x-ray vision. \n\nThis is particularly frustrating during stealth missions where remaining undetected is crucial. I've tried adjusting my approach, using different tactics, but nothing seems to work. It's as if the game's AI has been programmed to have an unfair advantage over the player. \n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or if it's an intentional game mechanic, but it's definitely impacting my enjoyment of the game. Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips or tricks to avoid being spotted so easily?",

I am reaching out to this community because I have been experiencing some health issues after recovering from COVID-19 and I am hoping to get some insights or advice from those who may have gone through something similar.\n\nAbout two months ago, I tested positive for COVID-19. It was a rough couple of weeks, but I managed to recover at home. However, since then, I've been experiencing some concerning symptoms that I didn't have before. I've been having chest pains, palpitations, and shortness of breath. I've also been feeling fatigued more often than not.\n\nI've read some articles suggesting that COVID-19 can have long-term effects on the heart, even in people who had mild symptoms. I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this? If so, how did you manage these symptoms? Did they eventually go away or did you need medical treatment?\n\nI have already scheduled an appointment with my doctor, but it's not for another couple of weeks.

I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of this decision and how it will affect those of us who are currently unemployed or seeking work. \n\nDoes this mean that we are not required to register for work during this period? Will there be any penalties or consequences for not registering? Also, what happens after April 24th? Will the mandatory work registration be reinstated immediately or is there a possibility of the suspension being extended?\n\nI would greatly appreciate if anyone with more knowledge or understanding about this could provide some insight.

    "Before everyone jumps to conclusions, let me explain. \n\nThis isn't about me not loving my son or abandoning him. I absolutely adore him.\n\nI divorced my ex-wife when my son was 4. We agreed to joint custody, which meant I saw my son every other weekend, on certain holidays and two weeks during summer vacation. I moved to another city for career reasons but there wasn't any issues with me visiting him and vice versa.\n\nLast year, my ex married a great guy who loves my son as his own. They have a great father-son bond, and I am genuinely happy for them. He recently got a job offer in another country, which is a great opportunity for him, but it means that my son would have to move away.\n\nWe discussed this as adults and my ex-wife suggested that my son should stay with me for a year until they settle in. Instead, I suggested that he moves with them. He had just started middle school, made some fantastic friends, and I honestly thought that uprooting him from something stable to living with me in a new environment will be more disruptive.\n\nThe other reason is that my job is demanding, which often needs me to work late and sometimes on weekends. I wouldn't be able to give my son the attention he deserves. Even though it was really hard, I decided that my son moving with my ex and her husband would be the best decision for his wellbeing.\n\nDoes it hurt like hell? Absolutely. Do I miss him? Every single moment. But I’m confidant that he's happy, safe and loved. We speak every day, we have video calls, we still connect but in a different way. In fact, I am hoping to visit him come summer vacation. I’m not choosing not to SEE my son, I’m choosing to put his needs above my wants. \n\nThis has been a difficult decision to make, but I believe it's the right one. I still struggle with feelings of guilt and pain, and the fear that I may not be doing enough for him. I’m sharing my story here, not in search of validation, but to provide perspective that sometimes, love and care may look different than what’s traditionally expected.",
    "I'm currently a high school student and I've been having a really hard time with one of my teachers. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder and there are certain things that can trigger my anxiety. I've been open about this with all my teachers and most of them have been understanding and accommodating. However, one of my teachers seems to be completely disregarding my condition.\n\nThis teacher has a habit of calling on students randomly to answer questions. This is one of my triggers. The unpredictability and the pressure of being put on the spot causes my anxiety to spike. I've tried explaining this to my teacher privately, but they brushed it off, saying that it's a part of life and I need to learn to deal with it.\n\nI understand the importance of learning to cope with my triggers, but I also believe that school should be a safe environment where I can learn without being in constant fear of an anxiety attack. I've been working with a therapist and we've been making progress, but this situation is making things really difficult for me.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. I've thought about talking to the school counselor or the principal, but I'm worried that it might make things worse. I don't want to be seen as a troublemaker or someone who's trying to get special treatment. I just want to be able to learn in peace.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "A few years ago, I had a falling out with a close friend—we'll call her Jenny—and we stopped talking. We had a history that spans back to high school but things became unbearable after she spread false rumors about me that affected my personal life dramatically.\n\nFast forward to now, and her high-school-aged kid—who I barely know—reached out to me for help. They're really passionate about astronomy and know that I have a background in the field. They asked for some assistance with assignments and college applications, possibly even letters of recommendation.\n\nI'm conflicically. On one hand, I know that this isn't the kid's fault and they're only seeking help from someone they believe could guide them towards success. On the other hand, Jenny and I haven't reconciled, and I'm still dealing with the backlash of the drama she caused.\n\nI politely declined the request stating that I am too busy with my own work and suggested that they seek help from their science teacher or online resources. This led to Jenny messaging me and calling me selfish for not helping her child, even referring to our past friendship as a reason for me to step in.\n\nI find it a bit hypocritical that she suddenly remembers our past friendship when she needs something, particularly considering the circumstances that led to the dissolution of said friendship. However, I still can't ignore the nagging feeling that I’m punishing the kid for their parent's actions. And I'm starting to feel like a piece of garbage about it.\n\nSo, fellow Redditors, AITA here?",
    "I've been playing Destiny 2 for a while now and I've noticed that the matchmaking in Crucible is a bit off. It seems like the system doesn't take into account the skill level of the players, which often results in unbalanced teams and one-sided matches. \n\nI've been paired with players who are clearly new to the game and don't have a grasp on the mechanics yet, while the opposing team is stacked with seasoned veterans. This not only makes the game frustrating for me, but it's also not fair to the new players who are just trying to learn and enjoy the game.\n\nMoreover, the matchmaking doesn't seem to consider the power level of the players' gear. I've seen players with high-level gear going up against those with significantly lower-level gear. This creates a huge power gap and makes the matches feel unfair.\n\nI understand that matchmaking can be a complex issue to tackle, but I believe that Bungie could do a better job at creating a more balanced and fair matchmaking system. Perhaps they could implement a skill-based matchmaking system or take into account the power level of the players' gear.\n\nI'm curious to hear what other players think about this. Have you had similar experiences? Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the matchmaking in Crucible?",
    "I started the ketogenic diet about a month ago after hearing so many success stories about people losing weight. I was really excited and motivated to start this journey. I followed all the guidelines, kept my carb intake below 20g per day, increased my fat intake, and maintained a moderate protein intake. I also made sure to drink plenty of water and get enough sleep.\n\nHowever, after a month of being on this diet, I haven't seen any changes in my weight. I'm feeling quite discouraged and confused. I thought I was doing everything right. I didn't cheat, I tracked my macros, and I even incorporated some light exercise into my routine. \n\nI'm wondering if I might be doing something wrong or if there's something I'm missing. I've heard that sometimes it takes a while for the body to adapt to this new way of eating, but I thought I would have seen at least some weight loss by now. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this?

    "As a recent graduate who is now living on my own, I've come to realize some harsh truths about adulthood that I feel the need to share with the younger generation, specifically those currently dominating the TikTok scene.\n\nLately, I've been seeing an influx of TikToks from kids - primarily high schoolers still living at home - complaining about their parents' crockpot meals. While I understand that not everyone's tastes are the same, I feel the need to offer a friendly reminder about the reality of being an adult based on my own experience.\n\nLiving alone means fending for yourself, and that includes cooking your own meals. I think back to my teenage years, where every dinner was pretty much already planned out and prepared by the time I got home. Even if it was a simple crockpot meal, it was still a hot and nutritious dinner that I didn’t have to lift a finger to prepare. Now, as an independent adult, the luxury of a home-cooked meal is something that I yearn for after a long day at work.\n\nWhen you live alone, your culinary repertoire either expands drastically or you're reduced to instant ramen and take-out. Trust me folks, there's a whole new appreciation you gain for slow-cooked home meals when you're trying to juggle adult responsibilities like a full-time job, bills, laundry, and the likes.\n\nSo, instead of turning your nose up at your parent's crockpot meals, I’d suggest that you appreciate the effort, time, and love that goes into preparing them while you still can. There will come a day when you’ll miss coming home to a house that smells like a delicious stew that has been simmering on low for eight hours.\n\nIn conclusion, to the kids currently complaining on TikTok, enjoy these carefree days while you still can. As an adult, even something as simple as a crockpot meal can be a huge blessing. You'll realize this sooner or later. Appreciate these moments, and maybe, just maybe, cook alongside your parents sometimes. You'll learn something and trust me, future you will thank you.",

Some people say it does, others say it doesn't. \n\nSo, I'm turning to you, fellow GTA Online players. Can you do the Intel and Prep for the Cayo Perico Heist in different sessions? If so, how does it work? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
    "After analyzing and experiencing the recent changes made to the Argus Advanced server, I must express profound dissatisfaction and concern. \n\nThe first issue lies in the stability of the server. After the updates, there have been numerous connectivity issues. The server frequently disconnects, which disrupts gameplay. This is surely not something we expect from an \"advanced\" server.\n\nAdditionally, the balance changes implemented are utterly baffling to me. For instance, while Argus is already a late-game hero, his early game performance has been deteriorated further. This makes the gameplay unnecessarily strenuous and less rewarding. \n\nMoreover, the user interface changes are far from being user-friendly. The previously simple and clean menu has now become unnecessarily complicated and cluttered. This is another area where previous functionality was better.\n\nLastly, I am disappointed with the removal of some of the key features that made Argus Advanced server somewhat unique and enjoyable. There’s no clear reason as to why these features were removed. The explanation provided is vague and certainly does not justify the decision.\n\nIn all, these changes have taken away a lot from the user experience instead of enhancing it as probably intended. I hope the team in charge considers revising these changes or at least provide a transparent rationale behind these decisions.\n\nI am curious to hear everyone else's thoughts on this as well. Are you enjoying the new changes or sharing similar concerns?",

    "I've been using public transportation for the better part of my life, and I've come to the conclusion that I absolutely despise busses. I'm not talking about a mild annoyance, I mean a deep-seated, visceral hatred. \n\nFirstly, they're never on time. I can't count the number of times I've been late to work, school, or appointments because the bus decided to show up 15 minutes late. Or worse, it arrives early and leaves before the scheduled time, leaving me stranded at the bus stop. \n\nSecondly, they're always crowded. I understand that they're a public service, but there's nothing worse than being crammed into a small space with dozens of strangers. It's uncomfortable, it's claustrophobic, and it's a breeding ground for germs. \n\nThirdly, the noise. Oh, the noise. The constant rumble of the engine, the screeching of the brakes, the chatter of the passengers. It's impossible to get any peace and quiet on a bus. \n\nLastly, the unpredictability. You never know what you're going to get on a bus. Unpleasant smells, loud music, people eating smelly food, someone taking up two seats with their bags... the list goes on. \n\nI understand that busses are a necessary evil for many people, myself included. But that doesn't mean I have to like them. I dream of the day when I can afford my own car and say goodbye to busses forever.

    "I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this, I'm just at a loss at what to do and I am extremely desperate. To give you some context, I'm a 19-year-old rugby player and I've had many concussions in my short career. \n\nThe first time was during a practice when I collided skulls with a teammate and spent a night in the hospital. The second one was during a game where I took a heavy fall and blacked out for a good minute or two. Even after these, I didn't really think much of it. Until a couple of months back when I started experiencing memory loss, migraines, concentration issues, and mood swings.\n\nI did my own research, and all of these symptoms seem to line up perfectly with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease found in athletes or people who have had repeated traumas to the head. And I'm terrified.\n\nI've already consulted with my team doctor who also seems to be taking it seriously but assures me that it could be many things other than the dreaded CTE. But I can't help but be consumed by this fear. The thought of having my mind slowly deteriorate before I even turn 25 is giving me sleepless nights. \n\nI feel like my life is over even before it truly began.

It's also been incredibly isolating as my friends and teammates don't seem to understand my fear and think I'm overreacting. \n\nI'm afraid of reaching out to my parents about this because they have always been so proud of me and my sports achievements. I don't want them to worry but I also don't know how to go through this alone.\n\nHas anyone else been through this and if so, how did you handle the fear? Are there treatments and therapy that can help me? How do I cope with the possibility that my future, my dreams, my aspirations might be lost?\n\nTL;DR: I'm a young rugby player and I'm scared I might have CTE due to multiple concussions. I'm constantly paranoid, afraid, and feel isolated from my friends and family. I could really use some advice, any advice. Please help me out.",
    "Balancing the line between caring and not caring too much can seem like a daunting task. There is a popular notion that in order to attract someone, you must convey that you aren't completely smitten with them. This, however, should not deviate you from the real purpose of liking someone which is to genuinely care and show interest in them.\n\nTo be attractive to someone, the first step is to be authentic, and genuinely interested in them as a person. Your care must be rooted in genuine concern, not out of a need to win favor. Remember, you cannot please someone at the cost of your self-respect and identity.\n\nOn the other hand, being overly attached or caring severely can make you appear needy and cause the other person to feel suffocated. It's important to respect their personal space, have self-esteem, and show independence. Additionally, being too available might make you less appealing.\n\nHence, the right balance would be providing care in a manner that demonstrates respect and love for the person and their personal space. Show genuine interest in their life, thoughts, opinions, likes, and dislikes, but also provide them with the space to reveal and share these at their own comfort level. \n\nUltimately, the key is to be comfortable and happy with yourself first which radiates an attractive energy. The more self-assured, confident, and invested in your own growth and interests you are, the more attractive you'll seem. Healthy self-care and self-love draw others in naturally.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no perfect formula. Every person is different, what works for one relationship might not work for another. The best approach would be to be genuine, care when it's required and give space when needed. Avoid playing games of appearing distant or not caring just to attract someone because this approach is often transparent and doesn't foster a healthy relationship in the long run.",
    "As a woman, equality advocate, and an active participant in various social activism platforms, I've been incredibly intrigued by observing and studying the impacts of third-wave feminism. While it is crucial to clarify that third-wave feminism has done wonders by highlighting the importance of equality, intersectional issues, and bringing forth dialogues about bodily autonomy and consent, I've noticed certain drawbacks that can potentially be harmful to women and gender equality itself. \n\nThe first issue I find with 3rd wave activism is the sometimes aggressive exclusion of men, particularly in predominantly online activism groups. While the need to create safe spaces for women to discuss, share, and fight for their rights is unquestionable, barring men from these spaces completely can potentially breed resentment and misunderstanding among them about the cause. We need to remember that gender equality is an issue that needs to be understood and dealt with by all genders, not just women.\n\nSecond, the third wave of feminism has an apparent inclination towards victimhood culture. Though it is highly critical for women to voice out about the issues and struggles they face, portraying women as perpetual victims could lead to a loss of empowerment. I think it's crucial for us to shed light on the strength and resilience of women, to inspire, motivate, and empower other women in their personal battles.\n\nAnother critique is its inclination towards call-out culture. The idea of calling out people for even the slightest hint of discrimination leads to animosity. This can result in more of a backlash than a constructive dialogue, causing people to feel attacked and defensive instead of educated and enlightened.\n\nLastly, focusing predominantly on identity politics sometimes takes away from the larger societal issues that need to be tackled. While it's essential to address individual experiences within different identities, focusing excessively on these individual categories may become divisive rather than unifying, fragmenting the cause and thereby lessening its overall impact.\n\nHowever, this critique doesn't mean that I am against third-wave feminism or the vital work it conducts in our societies. It's essential to remain critical of the movements we are a part of so that they can evolve and improve, and contribute more effectively to their cause. The intention of this post is to foster a discussion and encourage a critical examination of our approaches to social activism. I hope to instigate a dialogue that paves the way for more inclusive and empowering feminist movements.",
    "Hey Redditors. I am writing this post today because I am utterly overwhelmed and frustrated with our current situation. \n\nDaily, we trudge through a world that has become a shadow of what it once was, buried beneath layers of greed, corruption, and blatant disregard for the basic rights and freedoms of individuals. It is evident that the essence of democracy, respect, and dignity has been lost to the hands of those in power, who seem to be more vested in their own self-interests, rather than the welfare of the ordinary citizen. \n\nWe don't have to take this any longer. It does not have to be like this. Through the power of collective action, we can ignite change. We live in a society where our voices can be heard, where we can vote out ill-intentioned leaders, where we can protest the unjust, where we can call for reformation when it is needed, and where we can stand up for our rights.\n\nEnough of observing in silence. It's time to take a stand. It's time to question and challenge the oppressive systems and structures that bind us. Mere acceptance of this status quo is not an option for man, they are but silent chains tethering us to a reality we do not want, did not ask for, and certainly do not have to accept. \n\nComplacency is the breeding ground for oppression. Let's break free from that. Let's be that change. Let's mobilize, organize, and strategize to propel ourselves towards a world that values fairness, equality, and justice for all. We hold significant power, and when our voices unite, we become a force that can alter the future.\n\nRemember that our silence is complicity, and that every voice counts, however small it may seem. I strongly believe that together, we can and will make a difference. Let's not stand idly by and watch as our rights, freedoms, and dignity are systematically stripped away. \n\nENOUGH IS ENOUGH... Our collective inaction has cost us more than we can afford, and it's high time we rise. Let this post serve as a reminder, a call to action, and a beacon of hope. We are stronger together, and we don't have to take this any longer. Today, let's decide to make our voices heard, to stand uncompromisingly for what is right, and to never again accept a reality that does not value us as equal, free-thinking beings. \n\nStay strong, all. Change may be slow, but it is",
    "Hey everyone!\n\nSo, I got my tongue pierced about a week ago now and until recently, everything seemed to be going pretty smoothly. However, over the past two days, I've noticed excessive swelling and some uncomfortable crud around the piercing bit. I'm also experiencing a lot of discomfort and a foul taste in my mouth. Plus, the pain seems to be increasing, and I'm beginning to get worried. \n\nI've been religious about my aftercare routine, so I'm surprised and scared that it's apparently developed an infection. I've been rinsing with non-alcoholic mouthwash four times a day, especially after eating or drinking anything, and I've also been using a saline solution twice a day. \n\nI really don't want to remove the piercing because of how much I love it, but I'm getting a little desperate here. I would be grateful if anyone could provide some advice or information about what I should do next. More specifically, should I contact the place where I had it done and see if they suggest anything (they do provide aftercare advice for these situations)? Should I go to a clinic?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Please share your thoughts and experiences as they might be really helpful. Also, I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask this, just redirect me where to go if that's the case.",
    "Hey everyone,\n\nI've recently picked up vaping again after a long hiatus and I'm feeling a bit out of the loop. The technology and products seem to have evolved quite a bit since I last vaped and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the new options available.\n\nI used to vape with a simple pen-style device, but now there are box mods, pod systems, sub-ohm tanks, and a whole lot of other terms I'm not familiar with. I'm not sure what would be the best fit for me now. I'm looking for something that's easy to use, but still delivers a satisfying experience.\n\nAlso, I've noticed that there are a lot more e-liquid flavors and brands than before. I used to vape tobacco and menthol flavors, but I'm open to trying new ones. Any recommendations for good quality, tasty e-liquids?\n\nLastly, I'm a bit concerned about safety. I've heard some stories about batteries exploding and I want to make sure I'm doing everything right to avoid any accidents. Any tips or resources on vaping safety would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for your help. I'm looking forward to getting back into vaping and being part of this community again.",
    "I'm really struggling right now and I'm hoping someone here can help me understand what's going on. My mom was recently diagnosed with poorly differentiated cancer. The doctors have tried to explain it to us, but it's all so overwhelming and confusing. I've tried to do my own research online, but everything I find is either too technical or too vague. \n\nI understand that poorly differentiated means the cancer cells don't look like normal cells and they grow and spread more quickly. But what does this mean in terms of treatment options? Prognosis? I'm scared and I feel so helpless. \n\nIf anyone has any experience with this type of cancer or can point me towards some resources that might help me understand better, I would really appreciate it. I just want to be able to support my mom and help her through this, but right now I feel like I'm failing. \n\nThank you in advance for any help or advice you can provide.",
    "I'm going through a tough time right now. My partner of three years decided to end things between us. I'm feeling a lot of pain and sadness, which I know is normal. But what's really bothering me is the constant self-blame and self-criticism. I keep replaying our relationship in my head, thinking about what I could have done differently, how I could have been a better partner. I'm beating myself up over every little mistake I made, and it's making the healing process even more difficult.\n\nI understand that it's important to reflect on our actions and learn from our mistakes. But I also know that it's not healthy to constantly blame myself and dwell on the past. I need to find a way to stop this self-destructive behavior and start focusing on healing and moving forward.\n\nI'm reaching out to this community because I know many of you have been through similar situations. How did you stop beating yourself up after being dumped? How did you manage to forgive yourself and move on? Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
    "So, this happened to me recently and I just needed to vent about it somewhere. I was scrolling through some old photos on my phone and found one where I thought I looked pretty good. I decided to share it on my social media, just because I was feeling confident and happy with how I looked in that particular picture.\n\nA few minutes after posting, I started getting likes and positive comments which made me feel even better. But then, out of nowhere, a friend of mine commented something along the lines of \"You're not that good looking, don't get ahead of yourself.\" \n\nI was taken aback. I mean, I wasn't posting the picture to fish for compliments or anything, I just genuinely liked how I looked in it. It was a rare moment of self-confidence for me and this comment just completely deflated it. \n\nI know it might seem like a small thing, but it really got to me. It's not about needing validation from others, but more about the fact that someone felt the need to bring me down when I was feeling good about myself. \n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? How did you handle it? I'm trying not to let it get to me, but it's easier said than done.",
    "Fed up to the teeth with these college applications. Look, I get it, higher education and the ensuing debt are rites of passage in our society—blah, blah, blah. But my wallet's already on a diet, man. \n\nI do not have $70 or more to shell out for each college application fee. How do they even justify this exorbitant price? For someone just to *read* my application? A task that’s probably automated anyway?! No, no, no. That's a scam. \n\nImagine charging broke high school students who aren’t even sure if they want to attend college, hundreds, sometimes even thousands (depending on the number of colleges one applies to), just for a chance to be considered. Then there's the SAT/ACT registration fees, CSS profile costs, and don’t even get me started on sending your test scores to each college. Every step of this process seems designed to suck our wallets dry!\n\nAnd you'd think, \"Oh, but financial aid and fee waivers should solve this issue, right?\" Well, guess what, they don't. There are so many conditions to meet to be eligible for these waivers, and even when you do, a lot of universities only have a limited amount of waivers to give. \n\nHonestly, it feels like some sort of twisted Hunger Games, where instead of fighting for food, we're scrambling for money to gain access to a life that should be an inherent right - quality education. And to be trapped in that vicious cycle of debt they call a student loan afterwards.\n\nSo my plea to colleges: stop this madness. Education is a right, not a luxury. Create a system that encourages learning and growth instead of pushing students into a cycle of debt and stress. Or at the very least, stop charging us to just consider our applications. Leave us broke students alone!",

    "Hello everyone,\n\nI wanted to give an update on my previous post about my husband who wanted to conduct a social experiment related to QAnon. \n\nFirstly, I want to thank everyone who took the time to respond and provide advice. It was incredibly helpful and gave me a lot of perspective on the situation. \n\nAfter a lot of thought, I decided to have a serious conversation with my husband about my concerns. I expressed my worries about the potential negative impacts of his experiment, both on our relationship and on his mental health. I also shared some of the insights I gained from this community, which helped me articulate my points better.\n\nTo my relief, he was receptive to my concerns. He admitted that he hadn't fully considered the potential consequences and agreed to reconsider his approach. We decided to seek professional help to navigate this situation. We've started attending therapy sessions, which have been very helpful so far.\n\nHe's also agreed to take a break from the QAnon community. He's realized that it was taking up too much of his time and energy, and that it was affecting our relationship. \n\nIt's still a work in progress, but I'm hopeful about the future. I know it's going to be a long journey, but I'm glad we're taking steps in the right direction. \n\nAgain, thank you all for your support and advice. It's been invaluable during this difficult time. I'll continue to update as things progress. \n\nStay safe everyone.",
    "Okay, so as the title suggests, I played merely 10 minutes of Wolfenstein Youngblood, and dear lord, does it make me want to shed a torrent of sorrowful tears. \n\nNow, don't get me wrong, it's not the visuals that irk me. They were solid with a good deal of attention to detail, but that's probably the only good thing I can say about the game so far. \n\nMy main problems stem from the gameplay mechanics and story aspects. In order to understand where I'm coming from, you need to know that I'm a longtime fan of the Wolfenstein series. I consider the New Order to be an absolute masterpiece, filled with gut-wrenching story, comprehensive character development, and gameplay that was a perfect blend of strategic shooting and old-school FPS action. \n\nYoungblood, however, seems to have veered off a cliff in comparison. First impressions are important, and right off the bat, the story seems incredibly thin and uninteresting. And the protagonists, the twin daughters of B.J. Blazkowicz, feel stale and one-dimensional. They lack the depth and charm that made the characters of previous installments memorable. It lacks the seriousness of the previous games and leans too heavily on humor, which often feels out of place given the setting.\n\nAs for the mechanics, it feels less like Wolfenstein and more like Destiny. They've turned it into a looter shooter with health bars, armor types, and stats. Nothing penetrates, not even a well-aimed headshot. The inclusion of RPG-like aspects with different levels for enemies just does not mesh well with the usual fast-paced straightforward shooting style associated with the Wolfenstein name.\n\nTo top it all off, the forced co-op is a terrible move. Yes, you can play solo with an AI partner, but the AI is almost completely brain dead, often rushing in and dying needlessly, blowing cover, or just standing in one spot.\n\nIn all honesty, it feels as if something beloved has been ripped away from me. It's not the Wolfenstein I grew up with and loved. It hurts even more because my expectations were high. Maybe things improve as the game progresses, but the initial impression was too off-putting for me.\n\nMy apologies for the rant. I just needed to share my dismay and disappointment with someone.

    "Recognizing that there's a problem is the first step to overcoming it and I am glad that I have taken that.

    "I am writing this to share my experience of getting testosterone (T) through Planned Parenthood and hope it helps those who are considering it as an option. Planned Parenthood is an organization that offers many different services, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for transgender individuals. I started my T journey a couple of months ago and here's how it went.\n\nI first went to Planned Parenthood around August last year for a general check-up and expressed my interest in starting T. The nurse I spoke with was very understanding, professional, and answered all of my questions honestly. I was informed that PP follows an informed consent model, meaning I didn't require a letter from a therapist or a long evaluation process to start HRT.\n\nFast forward to about a month later, I had a phone consultation where a nurse asked me various questions about my health, mental state, and reasons for wanting to start T. She also made sure that I understood the potential effects and risks of T.\n\nAbout a week after the phone call, I was scheduled for an in-person appointment where they took my blood for lab work. I was also given an opportunity to ask more questions and go over the potential effects of HRT again. The staff was very patient, kind, and understanding throughout this process.\n\nOnce my lab results came back, I was called in for my first T shot appointment. Since then, I have been going back to PP every 2 weeks for my shots. They've walked me through the process of self-injecting, but I'm not quite comfortable doing it on my own yet.\n\nBilling was pretty transparent. I was told beforehand how much each appointment would cost. They also offer options for those without insurance or with financial constraints. \n\nOverall, my experience has been quite positive. The staff I dealt with were respectful and supportive. They did a great job explaining everything and making me feel comfortable. I was initially worried about going to Planned Parenthood for this, as I wasn't sure about their knowledge or acceptance of trans individuals, but those fears quickly vanished after my first visit.\n\nIn a nutshell, if you're considering starting testosterone and have access to a Planned Parenthood, it can be a great option. It might be different for each PP center, but I believe most of them follow the informed consent model which makes HRT quite accessible.\n\nI hope this post can provide some insight for those seeking information on this topic. Everyone's experience will differ, but positive stories can sometimes be harder to find, so I wanted to share mine.",

It's like a shadow that follows me everywhere, a constant reminder of my imperfections.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm hoping to achieve by posting this. Maybe I just needed to vent, to let it all out. Maybe I'm hoping someone out there can relate, can offer some advice or words of comfort. I don't know. All I know is that I'm tired. I'm tired of hating myself for things I can't change. I'm tired of living in the past. I just want to move forward, but I don't know how.",
    "I've been thinking about this mod concept for some time now, and I believe it could seriously enhance the Fallout gameplay experience. So, here are my thoughts:\n\nWhat if we could merge the teleportation functionalities of two unique locations - Mothership Zeta and Big MT (Old World Blues DLC)? This approach would mean escaping the frustration of being essentially 'stuck' in either of these locations, while simultaneously adding a cool piece of tech to our gameplay.\n\nFor context, once you reach Mothership Zeta in Fallout 3, you're essentially confined to the spacecraft with no fast travel option back to the Wasteland until you complete the main quest. This is also the case with Big MT in Fallout: New Vegas' Old World Blues DLC. Players would definitely benefit from an integrated teleportation system interconnecting these two places, saving time and making it more convenient.\n\nI envision this modification to function something like this:\n\n1. The instant you step into Mothership Zeta/Big MT, you'd be given a handheld device (or incorporated into the Pip-Boy) that would allow you to come and go as you please.\n2. In Mothership Zeta, it could be something like a salvaged alien tech, and in Big MT, assuming the innovative, high-tech theme, it could be a newly coded feature in your Pip-Boy.\n\nThis way, interconnecting two of the game's most intriguing locations would allow for a great balance between exploration and freedom.\n\nOf course, this is just an idea I've had floating around in my head. I admittedly have no modding abilities, but if anyone here is interested in developing this, feel free to run with it!\n\nWould love to hear thoughts, suggestions and potential improvements on this idea!\n",
    "Hello everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a little bit about my experience as a young mom. I had my first child when I was just 19 years old. It was a challenging time, as I was still figuring out who I was and what I wanted in life. I had to grow up quickly and learn how to balance my own needs with the needs of my child.\n\nFast forward to now, I'm 24 and I have three beautiful children. I've learned so much over the past few years and I wouldn't change my journey for anything. However, I've noticed that there's a lot of stigma attached to being a young mom. People often assume that I'm irresponsible or that I don't know what I'm doing. \n\nI want to challenge these stereotypes. Yes, being a young mom is hard. But it's also incredibly rewarding. I've learned so much about myself and about life through raising my children. I've become more patient, more compassionate, and more resilient. I've also learned how to prioritize my time and manage my finances effectively.\n\nI'm not saying that everyone should become a young mom. But I do think that we need to have more respect and understanding for young moms. We're doing the best we can in a difficult situation. And we're raising the next generation of leaders, thinkers, and doers.\n\nSo, to all the young moms out there, I see you. I appreciate you. Keep doing what you're doing. You're doing an amazing job. And to everyone else, let's show a little more kindness and understanding to the young moms in our lives. They deserve it.\n\nThanks for reading.",
    "I'm sitting here in the waiting room, pressed into an uncomfortable chair, trying to find words to write this post. The idea of going back to the hospital is terrifying me. Not because I'm scared of needles or tests but primarily due to a sense of déjà vu, the recollections of the previous visit are haunting me. \n\nA few months ago, I had my first encounter with a life-threatening situation. An emergency appendectomy brought me under the harsh lights and the cold atmosphere of the operation theatre. The experience was traumatic, to say the least, and the recovery period even more so. The sterile smell of the hospital, the echoing beeps of the machines, and the antiseptic white all around me had become my temporary reality. But I pulled through.\n\nCut to the present, I've been feeling unwell again. Routine tests and a follow-up consultation later, here I am, waiting for my name to be called out, mentally preparing to relive the ordeal. Ironically, this hospital, which serves as a beacon of hope for many, sends chills down my spine every time I think about it.\n\nI think part of what’s frightening me is the uncertainty — not knowing what’s wrong this time makes my imagination run wild. I'm caught in this loop of anxiety and fear, the thoughts of \"what-ifs\" and \"maybes\" continually swirling in my mind, making it hard for me to think clearly.\n\nI'm writing this post not to scare anyone but to share my apprehensions. I know there are many out there who share this fear, this dread of hospitals. I also know there are others who think this fear is irrational. But until you've lived it - until you've had your life changed in minutes by a diagnosis or a surgical procedure, it's tough to understand that fear.\n\nAnd still, despite the fear, despite the anxiety, life goes on. We pull our bravery from somewhere deep inside and face what we must. I'm doing the same - inhaling a deep breath, taking one step at a time, and keeping faith that this too shall pass. We are stronger than we think. Just wanted to put my thoughts into words and connect with others going through similar experiences. Thanks for reading.",
    "I've been on a steady dose of methadone for about a year now, and I've been considering the Bernese method to switch to Suboxone. I've heard a lot of success stories about it, but I'm a bit apprehensive about the process. \n\nMy main concern is the rapid taper that follows the Bernese method. I understand that the point of the Bernese method is to avoid withdrawal symptoms, but I'm worried about how my body will react to the rapid taper. I've been on a stable dose for a long time, and the thought of reducing my dose so quickly is a bit daunting.\n\nHas anyone here tried the Bernese method followed by a rapid taper? How did it go for you? Did you experience any withdrawal symptoms? How did you manage them? Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
    "Yesterday, while on a hike, my 6-month-old Golden Retriever puppy drank from a stream we came across. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now I'm starting to worry. I've heard that natural water sources can contain parasites and bacteria that can be harmful to dogs. \n\nShe seems to be acting normal so far, but I'm not sure if there are any symptoms I should be looking out for. I'm also wondering if I should take her to the vet just to be safe, or if that's an overreaction. \n\nHas anyone else's dog ever drank from a stream or other natural water source? Did they get sick? Should I be concerned about my puppy's health? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "I've been experiencing a strange issue with my PC for the past few weeks. At random intervals, all my screens turn grey. It's not a gradual change, but an instant switch from normal to grey. The PC doesn't freeze, I can still hear sounds from the game I'm playing or the video I'm watching, but I can't interact with anything. The mouse cursor is still visible and movable, but clicking doesn't do anything. \n\nI've tried pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL and ALT+TAB to see if I could get out of it, but to no avail. The only solution I've found so far is to manually restart my PC. This is obviously not ideal, especially when I'm in the middle of something important. \n\nI've checked my graphics drivers and they're up to date. I've also run a full virus scan and nothing came up. I'm not sure what else to do at this point. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

    "So I've been playing Camp Buddy for a while now, and as much as I love the game and the storyline, it's starting to take a toll emotionally. It may sound silly to some, but it's become a source of depression for me.\n\nThe game highlights youth, friendship, and innocent love, three things I feel like I've missed out on in my own life. I spent my adolescence being incredibly introverted, battling my own issues, and now being an adult with responsibilities, I feel like I've missed out on those carefree days.\n\nEach character in the game has their own unique story and background, some of which resonate with my own personal experiences, amplifying the feeling of longing and regret. It makes me wish I could turn back time, be a bit more courageous and out-going, make more friends, maybe even find love.\n\nSure, it's just a game. But games, books, movies - they're meant to evoke emotions, right? The characters and their stories seem too real at times, reminding me of my own past and the choices I've made.\n\nI appreciate the designers for their beautiful work and creating such endearing characters. I'm sure for many, the game brings an immense amount of joy. But for me, it's a painful reminder of my youth gone by and opportunities lost. \n\nJust felt like pouring out. Have any of you felt the same way about a game?",
    "I've been using my AirPods with my iPad for a while now, and for the most part, they've been great. However, I've recently run into a rather silly problem that's been driving me nuts.\n\nEvery time I connect my AirPods to my iPad, they work perfectly fine for a few minutes. But then, out of nowhere, the audio just cuts out. The AirPods are still connected according to the Bluetooth settings, and the battery isn't low or anything. The audio just... stops. \n\nI've tried disconnecting and reconnecting them, resetting the AirPods, resetting the iPad's network settings, and even tried them on my iPhone to see if the problem persists (it doesn't). I've also checked for any software updates, but everything is up to date.\n\nI've seen a lot of people praising Apple's ecosystem for its seamless integration and the whole \"it just works\" philosophy, but this issue has been anything but seamless. It's incredibly frustrating, especially when I'm in the middle of watching a video or listening to music and the sound just disappears.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this problem? Any suggestions on how to fix it? I love my AirPods and I really don't want to have to replace them, but this issue is making them almost unusable with my iPad. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
    "So, I've been playing Noby Noby Boy for a good while now, but my latest playthrough was WAY faster than any I've done before. I mean, we're talking lightning quick. \n\nI just started a new game as usual, getting into that wonderful bizarre world we all know and love, when everything just... went right. I figured out a new way to manoeuvre Boy that I'd never thought of before, which allowed me to stretch faster and more efficiently. It almost seemed too easy.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was already at Girl. I checked the time and I had only spent 5 minutes. 5 MINUTES! I was in disbelief. I thought it was pure luck. However, I started another game, replicated the same methods and again, 5-6 minutes.\n\nI've checked online and I can't seem to find anyone else who's managed to pull this off so quickly. Could I really have stumbled onto some sort of new speedrun strat?

    "I've been feeling this way for quite some time now. It's like I'm speaking a different language that no one else understands. I try to express my thoughts, feelings, and ideas, but it seems like they just fall on deaf ears. It's not that people are intentionally ignoring me or dismissing what I say, it's just that they don't seem to truly understand where I'm coming from.\n\nI've tried to explain my perspective in different ways, using different words, metaphors, and examples, but it's like there's a disconnect somewhere. It's incredibly frustrating and isolating. I feel like I'm on an island all by myself, shouting into the void.\n\nI'm not sure if it's because my thoughts are too complex, or if I'm just not good at expressing them. Maybe it's a bit of both. I just wish I could find someone who truly gets me, who can understand my thoughts and feelings without me having to explain them in painstaking detail.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? How do you cope with feeling misunderstood? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "I've been working in a small boutique jewelry store for a couple of years now. We sell a variety of unique, handcrafted pieces that cater to a wide range of tastes. However, not everyone appreciates the artistry and craftsmanship that goes into our products.\n\nYesterday, a woman walked into the store and immediately started criticizing one of our necklaces on display. She loudly declared it to be the \"ugliest thing\" she'd ever seen. I was taken aback, but I maintained my professionalism and asked her what kind of jewelry she was looking for.\n\nShe proceeded to describe a very generic, mass-produced style of necklace that you could find in any department store. I politely informed her that we didn't carry that kind of jewelry, as our focus was on unique, artisan pieces. She huffed and left the store in a hurry.\n\nI was a bit shaken by the encounter, but it also made me realize something. Our store may not be for everyone, and that's okay. We cater to a specific clientele who appreciate the uniqueness and artistry of our pieces. And while it's never pleasant to hear negative comments about our products, I'm proud of the work we do and the beautiful pieces we create.\n\nSo, to anyone who's ever been criticized for their taste or style, remember this: beauty is subjective. What one person finds ugly, another may find beautiful. Don't let anyone else's opinion diminish your love for what you find beautiful.",
    "I'm going to start this off by saying that I understand, now, the severity of my actions. I see why he left. I don't blame him.\n\nI was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) a few years ago. It explained much of my volatile behaviour, my intense fear of rejection or abandonment, my impulsivity, and the rage I would fly into for what seemed like the smallest of infractions. After diagnosis, I made a promise to myself and my boyfriend that I would find a way to manage it. He supported me in this, always believing that I could change.\n\nBut I didn't. I slipped into a routine of old habits. I used my illness as an excuse for actions that were inexcusable. His day was fraught with land mines - saying the wrong thing, not saying enough, being too distant or too close – all potential triggers for my anger, my fear, my insecurity. He walked on eggshells around me, always on high alert, always anxious. I was the abuser, exercising power and control in the most destructive of ways.\n\nHe gave me chance after chance to change, to get help, to acknowledge the damage I was doing to him and our relationship. But I was blind to it. I let myself believe that it was him causing my behaviour, not my BPD, not me. It was easier to shift the blame, but I now see how wrong I was.\n\nNow he's gone. He broke up with me two weeks ago. I can't bear the guilt, the shame, the thought of having pushed away the one person who loved me in spite of myself. I feel lost and hopeless and part of me just wants to disappear, to not exist anymore.\n\nI don't really know where I'm going with this post. Maybe I just want to say it out loud, in writing, format it into reality. Yes, I screwed up. Yes, I was abusive. Yes, I drove him away. Or maybe it's a plea for help, a desperate cry into the void of the internet. I don't really know. I just know that I can’t bear the pain and loneliness. I want it to stop. Don't know how to start picking up the pieces of my shattered self. \n\nI suppose I'm welcoming advice – on dealing with loss, guilt, self-blame, regret. I want to change, but I also don't know how to forgive myself for the hurt I've caused. For anyone who lives with BPD,",
    "I've been thinking about this hypothetical battle for a while now and wanted to get some opinions from fellow Dragon Ball fans. \n\nOn one side, we have Vegeta with Super Saiyan Blue Evolution (SSJBE) and Kaioken x20. This form is a significant power-up from the standard Super Saiyan Blue, and the addition of Kaioken x20 would theoretically multiply his power, speed, and senses by 20 times. \n\nOn the other side, we have Goku in his Ultra Instinct form. This form is characterized by a calm, focused state of mind that allows for incredible speed and reflexes. Goku's movements become automatic, dodging and countering attacks without conscious thought. \n\nSo, who do you think would win in a fight? \n\nWould Vegeta's raw power and speed be enough to overcome Goku's heightened senses and reflexes? Or would Goku's Ultra Instinct form allow him to dodge and counter all of Vegeta's attacks, eventually wearing him down? \n\nI'm interested to hear your thoughts and theories on this. Let's keep the discussion friendly and respectful.",
    "In statistics, accuracy variables are often squared for a number of reasons. The primary reason is to eliminate any negative values that can occur due to the difference between the predicted and actual values. This is particularly important in models where the absolute value of the error is more significant than its direction.\n\nSquaring the accuracy variables also emphasizes larger errors. This can be useful in many scenarios where larger errors are more costly and thus, should be minimized more aggressively. For example, in financial forecasting, a larger error could lead to significant financial loss, so it's more important to reduce these larger errors.\n\nAnother reason is that squaring makes the mathematics easier when it comes to calculus and finding minimum or maximum values. It allows for the use of derivative-based methods in optimization.\n\nLastly, squaring the accuracy variables can make the distribution of errors more normal (Gaussian), which is a desirable property in statistical modeling as many statistical techniques assume that the errors are normally distributed.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that squaring isn't always the best approach. It can overly penalize large errors, and in some cases, other methods like taking the absolute value might be more appropriate. It really depends on the specific context and the nature of the data you're working with.",
    "Okay, so I am currently 7 months pregnant with my first child. I always thought pregnancy would make me feel ugly and unattractive due to the inevitable weight gain and body changes, but boy was I wrong. \n\nI feel SO sexy being pregnant. Not only do I feel sexy, but my husband can't help but agree. The newfound voluptuousness of my body has really done something to him; he can't keep his hands off my belly and always reassures me how much he loves my new figure. It's honestly such a confidence boost.\n\nThis round, growing belly, cradling the life I'm bringing forth is something else completely. Somehow, it has given me a sense of empowerment I have never felt before. Sure, it does come with back pain and frequent trips to the restroom and knowing that my favorite jeans will be hanging in my closet for a while, but there is just something about the image of myself with this huge, pregnant belly in the mirror that makes me feel absolutely beautiful. \n\nIs there anyone else here that feels the same? I would love to hear your stories about how being pregnant has brought about a level of sexiness you didn't anticipate or how having a bump boosted your confidence. Let's share some positive vibes!",

    "I'm so done trying to excuse my dad's behavior. I've spent years trying to convince myself that he is a \"good person\", that he has his own struggles and hence the flaws. But today, I realized, it's not the struggle that defines him, it's his actions, his words, his decisions that are incredibly hurtful and unjust.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I've always lived under this fear of doing or saying something that might upset him, not because I respected him, but because I was scared of him. He has this knack of making people feel insignificant, guilty for errors that are not even theirs. He dominates, manipulates and belittles, then hides behind the cloak of being a provider, a protector and a father.\n\nI have tolerated his emotional, sometimes physical, abuse for years, trying to convince myself that it was just his way of showing love and that he didn't know any better, but no more. Tonight, I finally stood up to him, to his tyranny. He was demeaning my younger sibling for not being good at maths, something that he was struggling with. That was the last straw. I stood up not just for my sibling, but for myself, for my mother, for everyone who ever felt undermined by him.\n\nEveryone reading this: I'm not saying it's easy. It's not. Standing up to someone who has held power over you for a significant part of your life, especially a parent, is incredibly difficult. But it’s essential for your mental health and well-being. Just because they are a parent doesn't give them a free pass to treat you poorly. And you don't have to accept it either. You deserve love, respect, and kindness.

    "I hope everyone had a peaceful Easter Sunday. Mine was a bit of a rollercoaster, to say the least. \n\nMy family has always been deeply religious. We've been attending the same church for as long as I can remember. Every Sunday, without fail, we'd all pile into the car and head to the morning service. It was a tradition, a cornerstone of our family life. \n\nThis Easter Sunday, however, something changed. \n\nWe were all sitting around the dinner table, enjoying our Easter meal when the topic of church came up. My parents, usually the most devout among us, seemed... different. They were hesitant, almost uncomfortable. \n\nThen, out of nowhere, my dad said, \"We've been thinking... maybe it's time for us to step back from the church a bit.\" \n\nI was stunned. I mean, this is the man who taught me how to pray, who instilled in me the importance of faith. And now he was suggesting they might leave the church? \n\nMy mom chimed in, \"We're not abandoning our faith, just reevaluating our relationship with the church. We've been feeling a bit disconnected lately, and we think it might be best for us to take some time to reflect on our beliefs outside of the church setting.\"\n\nI'm still processing this. I respect their decision, of course, but it's a big change. It feels like a shift in the very foundation of our family. \n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? How did you handle it?

    "It's 3 am, and I cannot sleep. My mind is whirling with thoughts, but there's that one unwelcome memory that keeps seeping in – the lost chance.\n\nFour years ago, I quit my job to launch a start-up with my best friend. We had passion, determination, and an innovative idea. However, we lacked experience, understanding of the market dynamics, and sufficient capital. The one year we spent trying to make things work was a rollercoaster ride with a harsh landing – we ended up in heavy debt and a broken friendship.\n\nFast forward to now, a successful competitor has just launched a similar product as ours. I cannot avoid thinking about what could have been if we had just held on a bit longer or if we had approached things differently.\n\nI understand that dwelling on the past and on lost opportunities isn't right or helpful. But how is one supposed to just forget about the toils of hard work and dreams turned to dust?\n\nJust reflecting on the fact that we had a potential million-dollar idea in our hands and let it slip away pains me a bit. I see this as my biggest failure.\n\nI have learned a ton from this experience, which helps me perform better in my current job. But tonight I am just letting myself mourn the lost opportunity, the dream that could have turned into reality, the missed chance.\n\nIt's just one of those nights where it's okay to let these feelings surface, acknowledge them, understand them, rather than brushing them under the carpet. It definitely hurts, but I guess it's a good lesson that life goes on and I must too.\n\nHas anyone ever experienced such a feeling? How do you deal with it without drowning yourself in regret or what-ifs? It's a difficult storm to weather, and I can use any advice you might have.",
    "I've been a gamer for the better part of two decades, and I've seen the industry evolve in ways that are both exciting and deeply concerning. I'm not here to bash gaming as a whole, but rather to shed light on some of the issues that have been plaguing the industry and why I believe it's currently in a state of disarray.\n\nFirstly, let's talk about microtransactions and loot boxes. These have become a staple in many games, especially those from AAA studios. While I understand the need for companies to make a profit, the implementation of these systems often feels predatory and exploitative. It's not uncommon for games to be designed in a way that encourages, or even necessitates, spending additional money to fully enjoy or compete in the game.\n\nSecondly, the crunch culture in game development is a serious issue. Developers are often pushed to their limits to meet unrealistic deadlines, leading to burnout and a decline in the quality of the final product. This is not only detrimental to the developers' health, but it also affects the quality of the games we play.\n\nThirdly, there's a lack of innovation in the industry. Many studios seem to be playing it safe, sticking to tried-and-true formulas rather than taking risks and pushing boundaries. This leads to a market saturated with similar games, and it's disappointing for those of us who crave something new and different.\n\nLastly, the handling of intellectual properties is another concern. We've seen beloved franchises either mishandled or milked dry, with sequels and spin-offs that fail to capture the magic of the original games. This not only tarnishes the legacy of these franchises but also leaves fans feeling disillusioned.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are still many great games and passionate developers out there, these issues are casting a dark shadow over the industry. It's my hope that by bringing these problems to light, we can encourage change and ensure a brighter future for gaming.",
    "Over the recent years, I've noticed a common term sprouting up in fitness and exercise discussions: tapering. Regularly used in the context of endurance sports, tapering seems to be gaining a lot of traction - if not importance - in different sporting and fitness regimen.\n\nI understand that tapering incorporates a reduction in training intensity and volume, typically applied as a strategic move before major competitive events. However, what I want to understand more is: why is it gaining such popularity? What benefits does it offer, both mentally and physically, over regular training? Why are training schedules suddenly making generous room for this practice?\n\nAlso, many fellow athletes swear by different tapering 'schedules' or periods. Some recommend a few days, while others endorse a few weeks. Is there scientific backing for these varied periods, or is it subjective to individual capabilities and variability?\n\nIn essence, I am inviting a discussion and looking for insights into the merits and demerits of tapering. Also, I would love if someone can shed light on optimal periods and intensities of tapering that would be beneficial for most. \n\nHoping to get enlightening responses from seasoned athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and health experts on this platform!",

    "I've been pondering this for a while now and I thought I'd pop on here to see what other people might think. Many of us lean onto religion or spirituality in search of divine guidance, comfort, and peace; believing that a higher power, perhaps labeled as 'God', showers us with a form of unconditional love. However, from a more introspective standpoint, is it possible that what we perceive as 'God’s love' actually emanates from within us?\n\nWe often tend to anthropomorphize 'God' and there is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it can sometimes make us forget that divine entities, in most belief systems, are beyond human understanding. They do not possess human emotions or human limitations. So, could it be that what we are perceiving as God’s love traversing the conduits of time, space, and reality to reach us, might actually be our own innate ability to love ourselves unconditionally?\n\nIf this is a reality we accept, then shouldn't one of the ultimate goals of spirituality or religion be learning to fully love and accept ourselves, tapping into our infinite potential for self-love and compassion?\n\nNo disrespect is meant to anyone's believes here, and just to reiterate, these are just some personal thoughts I’ve been grappling with that I wanted to share with the community. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and opinions, whether they align with what I've said or come from a different viewpoint altogether.",
    "I've been a part of this community for a considerable amount of time and have appreciated the insightful discussions and varied perspectives that are constantly brought to light here. However, lately something has been bothering me. Whenever a discussion is opened about women's issues, it seems that the default response is to create a mirrored thread for men's issues.\n\nNow, I understand the necessity of inclusivity and equality, and I do not dispute that men's issues are also paramount and deserve their due attention. My grievance is not with the creation of such threads. It's just that it can be incredibly frustrating to see discussions about women's issues constantly countered rather than being taken on their own merit.\n\nThere's this implicit expectation that any conversation about women has to be 'balanced out' by a similar conversation about men. It feels like a knee-jerk reaction, a sort of \"but what about men?\" perspective, and it inadvertently downplays or dismisses the discussions we are trying to have about women's experiences.\n\nAcknowledging women’s issues doesn’t take away from the serious issues that impact men. The constant pushback feels defensive and alienating. It can devalue the discussion and change the course of the conversation in a way that doesn’t feel constructive.\n\nWe cannot gain a comprehensive understanding of gender issues if we keep switching the narrative. Some issues are predominantly faced by women, just like some are predominantly faced by men. We should be able to discuss each according to their dynamics, not as mirrored versions of each other.\n\nIt would be refreshing if we could sometimes just discuss matters pertaining to women and their plights without being met with an inevitable counter thread. We don't always have to apply the seesaw principle here. Sometimes, we just want to explore the topic at hand without causing a backlash or feeling like we're excluding others.\n\nI hope we can resolve this issue to make our discussions and debates even more fruitful. Thank you for taking the time to read this and for any input you might have on the matter.",
    "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently facing a bit of a dilemma and I'm hoping to get some advice from you all. I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science and there's a specific class that I need to take next semester to stay on track with my graduation plan. However, all the sections for this class are already full.\n\nI've been on the waitlist for a while now, but it doesn't seem like I'll be able to get a spot. I've also tried reaching out to the professor, but they said they can't do anything about it.\n\nI'm considering emailing the dean to request an additional section for this class. I believe there are other students in the same situation as me, so an extra section could benefit more than just myself. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this is appropriate or if it would even make a difference. I don't want to overstep any boundaries or come off as entitled. \n\nHas anyone ever done this before? If so, how did you phrase your email? And did it work? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance!",
    "I've been encountering an error message lately while playing on Steam: “Disconnected by VAC: You cannot play on secure servers”. This error started popping up after the last update, and it's been proving to be a huge hindrance in my gaming experience.\n\nJust to give you guys a clear picture, I've tried a few things to fix it. I’ve verified the integrity of game files, restarted my computer, reinstalled Steam, and even completely reinstalled the game. Unfortunately, none of these strategies seemed to have worked. \n\nThere's no chance of me having cheat software on my computer, as I've never used such stuff. The only software I run while playing games are Discord, MSI Afterburner, and sometimes Spotify.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has gone through this issue and has any potential solutions? Could it be an issue with my account? Or is it some game or server-related bug?\n\nAny insight would be appreciated. Thanks, guys!",
    "Lately, I've been feeling different and it's hard to put into words. But it feels like an ever-looming cloud of sadness and inexplicable emptiness inside me. There are good days, but also an overwhelming number of bad ones. I feel isolated and disconnected, I seem to have lost interest in things I once loved, my eating and sleeping patterns are all over the place, and sometimes I just feel this constant exhaustion that no amount of sleep seems to fix.\n\nI've read multiple articles and watched videos about mental health, specifically depression, and I think I may be resonating with a lot of the symptoms. But I am terrified to accept it without being sure.\n\nThe thing is, I live in a nuclear family setup and mental health issues are a bit of a sensitive subject. I just don't know how to approach the topic with my parents as they don't believe in mental illnesses like depression and think it's all just a hoax or an easy excuse for being lazy, which I know isn't true. \n\nDue to the nature of our healthcare system and my age (I'm underage), I am unable to get a diagnosis without my parents knowing and being involved. Plus, we have limited healthcare access and resources available where we live and it's quite expensive. \n\nI'm hoping to seek advice on how I can effectively deal with my situation - are there online resources or hotlines for anonymous counseling I can make use of? Also, any suggestions on how to communicate my feelings to my parents, considering their lack of understanding about mental health issues, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
    "I've run into a serious issue after trying to use the HP Recovery manager on my laptop. I initiated the process to recover some deleted files, thinking it would help me to restore my lost data. Little did I realize what was going to happen next.\n\nAs soon as I ran the program, my laptop screen went blank for a few seconds. Initially, I thought it was just part of the process. However, after a while when I didn't see any progress happening, I got a little worried. I decided to wait regardless.\n\nFinally, after some time, the screen came back to life, however, my laptop had reset completely! All my files, apps and even my personal settings were wiped off. It is as if the computer misunderstood my command to recover some files as to reset everything.\n\nThankfully, most of my files were backed up on an external hard drive but I am more worried because I did not expect the Recovery Manager to mess things up. If I hadn't had a backup, I would have been in a worse situation.\n\nIs this a common problem with HP Recovery Manager? Have any of you experienced this before and is there a way to fix this? Can I avoid such situations in future? I really need to understand what caused this & prevent this from happening again. Any help would be highly appreciated.",

    "So here's the situation: I recently purchased a somewhat pricey item from a seller on a popular online platform. The seller had good ratings and everything seemed above board. However, after my payment went through, things have taken a rather suspicious turn. \n\nAccording to the tracking details provided by the seller, the item was allegedly shipped immediately after my purchase. The problem? It's been over 10 days and the package is still marked as \"pre-transit\". \n\nI've messaged the seller twice with no response. The shipping service also can't provide any information since apparently the package hasn't been dropped off with them. Basically, it seems like the seller just printed off a shipping label, informed me the item is on its way, but then hasn't actually sent anything out.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? Should I open a dispute with the payment service or the platform? Is this a scam or could it just be an innocuous error? Would appreciate any advice from fellow online buyers who've navigated this sort of thing before. Thanks in advance.\n",
    "So, here's the situation: My co-worker (I'll call him Bob) has a habit of making offensive or derogatory comments, and every time he gets called out on it, he just brushes it off as \"just a joke\".\n\nYesterday, he made a sexist comment about another female colleague in the office (who wasn't present at the time). Everyone - two guys and me - kinda laughed awkwardly. I felt uncomfortable, and came right out and told him it's not a joke, it's disrespectful. \n\nBob got defensive and told me I had no sense of humor, that I'm always ruining the 'fun'. People in the office now are divided.

    "It's strange because I fully understand that I have no control over the condition I have, and that it's not my fault I have it. But sometimes I can't help but to feel more than just a twinge of shame about it. I guess society has woven this picture in my brain that physical health issues are acceptable, if not commendable to have overcome or be battling, but mental health issues? That’s different. There’s a near unconscious & pervasive stigma against it still.\n\nI've been dealing with bipolar disorder and ADHD for a number of years now. It gets difficult to manage at times, and I've sought professional support for it, but I still feel sort of embarrassed to talk about it outside of my therapist's office or anonymous online spaces like this one.\n\nSometimes, I find myself dreaming of a world where anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, etc. could be as normal to talk about as a broken bone or even chronic physical illnesses. I wish we didn't have to hide our struggles or our treatment plans. I wish I didn't feel like it's something to be ashamed of.\n\nDo any of you feel like this too? I wonder how you deal with these feelings in our largely unreceptive world? Any coping mechanisms or tricks you have found to work for you?\n",
    "Hi all,\n\nLast night, for the first time ever, I decided to bleach clean my bathroom. I mixed bleach with some water and went about cleaning. While I did not have any immediate reactions, I woke up this morning with red, itchy patches on my skin, specifically on my arms and hands. Not too sure whether it was because I used the bleach or if it's just a coincidence. \n\nFor context, I did wear gloves while cleaning but I didn’t wear long sleeves. So, I'm guessing it could be splash back on my arms and even on my hands from when I took off the gloves. I have washed my skin several times with mild soap and I've also applied some anti-itch cream, but so far, there's little improvement. \n\nI'm also feeling a bit paranoid now about having inhaled a lot of the fumes, because I realize I didn't ventilate the bathroom as well as I should have. I'm not really experiencing any symptoms in that regard, but I can't help but feel anxious about potential harm that I've done to my lungs. \n\nSo, I have two questions: \n\n1. Has anyone experienced skin irritation from bleach? If yes, how long did it last and what did you use to treat it?\n2. Should I be worried about potential inhalation of bleach fumes?\n\nThis is the first time I've had such an experience, so any advice or guidance would be appreciated. Also, any bleach handling safety tips for the future would be incredibly helpful.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "So, I work in a local boutique known for its unique handcrafted jewelry. We have this policy wherein we cannot accept a return without receipt, as we need to establish that the purchase was indeed made from our store. \n\nToday, this middle-aged woman comes in fuming, practically throws a necklace at me and demands a full refund. She ranted about how your average, dime-a-dozen store would be ashamed to sell such a hideous piece. I'll admit, the obsidian pendant with intricate copper filigree work isn't for everyone, but it definitely isn't hideous.\n\nHaving worked here for a couple of years, I'm quite familiar with our inventory and couldn't remember anything specific about that piece. I asked her if she had a receipt. Predictably, she said she lost it. She was getting irate, so I calmly explained our return policy again. \n\nEntitled Customer: \"But your necklace is ugly, and I want my money back.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, but without a receipt, we can't proceed with the return.\"\n\nThen, she gave me the \"Are you kidding me?!\" look.\n\nOut of curiosity, I double-checked our sales register, and voila! We never sold that specific necklace in the first place. Now, it's not unusual for a customer to get mixed up about where they bought something, but her attitude was another story.\n\nOnce I informed her of this, her face was all shades of red. Never seen someone high-tail it out of a store so fast.\n\nMoral of the story: Not everyone has the same taste in jewelry. And, always keep your receipts!",

    "I've been off of Kratom for 35 days now. Cold turkey. It hasn't been an easy journey, on the contrary, it's been a struggle each step of the way. But one thing I've come to realize, is that sometimes, we cling so hard to our nightmares not because we enjoy the pain, but it's primarily because it's all we know. We're comfortable with the familiar, the known, even if it's a cycle of suffering.\n\nUpon realizing this, I've found it a bit easier dealing with this process of withdrawal and recovery. My addiction, albeit a nightmare, was a world I was familiar with. This new realm I'm entering, one of sobriety and self-control, is a foreign place that seems uncertain and threatens my comfort zone.\n\nI finally understand the saying of ‘the devil you know is better than the devil you don't.’ But is it? Wouldn't it be better to explore the unknown, step into new territories, and take control of our lives rather than keep enduring the pain of addiction simply because it's the path \"we know and understand\"?\n\nAnybody else going through the same struggle, just remember, \"if nothing changes, nothing changes\". If you're scared of trying something new because of the uncertainty that comes with it, remember that staying in your comfort zone won't bring you any growth or progress.\n\nEvery day gets a little bit easier, and every day I'm learning to let go of my old nightmares. Let's not cling to this nightmare just because we are used to them. We are stronger than we believe and can overcome anything if we believe in ourselves. Stay strong, everybody. Keep going. Keep growing.",
    "As a long-term member of this community, I feel deeply compelled to address an issue that's been nagging me lately. There's this growing trend – or misconception, rather – where people view vaping as a viable alternative to self-harm. I don't intend to promote either behavior. Both are harmful, but I reckon it's necessary to clear up this misinterpretation, which might inadvertently draw those seeking solace into another harmful practice.\n\nFirstly, let's address self-harm. It's a complex issue, often reflecting deep emotional distress, and is something that should receive the attention of professional help rather than just a mere 'switch'. Therapy, medication, and other support systems are the real routes towards healing. Self-harm is never something that should be brushed under the carpet or addressed with temporary crutches.\n\nNow for vaping. While yes, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that it's less harmful than conventional smoking, it's most definitely not harm-free. Nicotine is still present in most e-cigarettes, which is a highly addictive substance. It can harm adolescent brain development and lead to addiction. \n\nSwapping self-harming for vaping is not a solution because both practices have negative consequences. They're simply different manifestations of harmful behaviors. Rather than swapping one damaging habit for another, the focus should be on fostering positive coping mechanisms and reaching out to professional help.\n\nIf you, or anyone you know, are thinking about self-harming or are seeking a less harmful option, I'd strongly suggest speaking to a professional, like a therapist, counselor, or even a trusted doctor. There are many online resources, hotlines, and apps available if you need immediate help. \n\nRemember, it's always okay to seek help. Battling these tendencies doesn't make you weak, but stronger. You deserve the support, love, and care needed in these tough times. We're a community here, we're here to support each other - but that must extend beyond this forum and into our real lives where professional resources can provide a ladder out of these harmful cycles.",
    "Brace yourself, fellow Redditors, the Battle of Chungus Island has commenced. Chungus Island, as you might know, is a real-time strategy multiplayer game with its roots firmly planted in the Reddit community. The game itself is located on a mystical, remote island overrun with multiple factions all seeking control over the valuable resources available.\n\nThere have always been minor skirmishes, but recently, the island has evolved into a battlefield. A clash of epic proportions has just begun with top guilds from around the globe squaring off against each other. The competition to control territory and resources has never been this fierce.\n\nThe reason for my post today is to rally support for these intensive, blood-pumping wars and call upon all of you to join in this battle. Are you a strategic genius determined to lead your forces to victory, or perhaps a seasoned melee warrior proficient in the art of sword-fighting?\n\nChungus Island needs you! There are factions that are fighting for justice, clans that value brotherhood and groups that are governed by anarchy. But no matter which side you choose, know this; each faction needs more robust warriors and cunning strategists. The victories are sweeter when shared, the defeats less bitter with comrades around.\n\nWhether you've already picked up your virtual sword or still thinking about joining - this is the moment. The moment where you can etch your journey, struggle, camaraderie, and triumph into the annals of Chungus Island history.\n\nThis is more than just a call to arms, it’s about building friendships, honing your strategic skills and facing challenges that this magical Island throws at you. Only the strong will survive, while the clever will thrive.\n\nRemember, in this Battle of Chungus Island, there is more than just victory or defeat at stake.

    "I've been noticing a disturbing trend lately, both online and in real life, where individuals who are struggling with anorexia feel the need to shame or belittle others for their eating habits. I understand that anorexia is a serious mental health disorder and I empathize with those who are battling it. However, I believe it's important to address this issue as it's causing harm to others.\n\nI've seen people being criticized for eating a slice of pizza, for enjoying a dessert, or even for just having a regular meal. This is not okay. Everyone has the right to enjoy food without being made to feel guilty or ashamed. Food is a necessity for survival and it's also one of life's great pleasures. No one should be made to feel bad for nourishing their body.\n\nI understand that those with anorexia may have a distorted view of food and body image, but it's not fair or right to project these insecurities onto others. It's important to remember that everyone is fighting their own battles and we should aim to support each other rather than tear each other down.\n\nIf you're struggling with anorexia, I urge you to seek help. There are many resources available and professionals who can provide the support and treatment you need. But please, let's not make others feel bad for their eating habits. We should all strive to create a supportive and understanding environment where everyone feels comfortable and accepted, regardless of their relationship with food.",

    "Sigh... I just need to vent this out and hope you all could sympathize or perhaps provide some advice.\n\nFor context, I'm a 24-year-old software engineer. I was making some pretty decent money for someone my age and had been with this promising startup for three years. I loved what I was doing, I was extremely skilled in the codes I wrote, and I respected my colleagues. In every sense, it was the perfect job, and I could see myself working there for years.\n\nThat was until yesterday.\n\nWe were planning to launch a new product, something we've been working on for a year. It was expected to sky-rocket the company into new heights and bring in a ton of revenue. But as the head of the development team, I had a lot of pressure on my shoulders.\n\nWorryingly, as we were nearing the launch date - just a few days away - I found what appeared to be a minor bug. I thought it would be a quick fix, but panic set in as I realized how deep-rooted this bug was. This single issue could basically break the product we were releasing, making it essentially useless. \n\nI worked tirelessly - hours on end, I could barely see from exhaustion, much less think clearly. After three entire sleepless nights, I fixed the bug... or so I thought. Because in the process, I’d made an even bigger mistake.\n\nIn my state of utter exhaustion, tinged with relief that I'd squashed the bug, I hurriedly pushed the new code to production without thoroughly testing it. \n\nWhen I woke up (or rather, rose from my desk where I'd fallen asleep), I found hundreds of emails and missed calls on my phone. \n\nIt turns out, the \"fix\" I implemented was worse than the initial bug. It crashed our entire system and wiped out months of work. Not only had we missed the launch, but we also had lost so much critical data that it could potentially sink the company.\n\nI've never felt so low in my entire life. \n\nI screwed up extremely bad, to the point of potentially ruining a multi-million-dollar company and upsetting countless people who counted on me. How do you even begin to bounce back from something like that? \n\nI guess I'm posting this as a cautionary tale to others. No matter how confident or skilled you are, always double-check your work, especially if a lot is riding on it. Always insist on thorough testing, no matter the pressure or deadlines. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading",

    "Growing up, my sister and I were raised in a household where love was a scarce commodity. Our parents were always too busy with their own lives, their jobs, their friends, and their hobbies. We were left to fend for ourselves, emotionally and sometimes even physically. \n\nI remember countless nights when we would sit in our shared bedroom, whispering stories to each other, trying to fill the silence that our parents left behind. We would dream about what it would be like to have parents who were present, who cared about our day, who hugged us and told us they loved us. \n\nAs we grew older, we tried to find that love elsewhere. We sought it in friendships, in romantic relationships, in achievements and accolades. But no matter how much love we received from the outside world, it never seemed to fill the void left by our parents' neglect. \n\nI'm writing this post not to garner sympathy, but to reach out to others who may have experienced the same thing. I want you to know that you're not alone. That it's okay to feel hurt and angry and confused. That it's okay to grieve the love you never received. \n\nAnd most importantly, I want you to know that it's possible to heal.

I've been feeling overwhelmed and stressed out, and I think it's time for me to move on. However, I've never quit a job before and I'm not sure how to go about it. \n\nI want to leave on good terms and not burn any bridges, but I also want to make the process as quick and easy as possible. I'm not sure how much notice I should give, how to tell my boss, or what to say. I'm also worried about how my coworkers will react and how to handle their reactions.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or tips on how to quit a job quickly and easily? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
    "I've been trying to convert a 4K video file on my home server, which is a pretty decent setup (16GB RAM, i7 processor). However, every time I attempt the conversion, I receive an error message stating \"The server was not powerful enough to convert the video\". \n\nI've tried reducing the resolution of the video, closing all other applications to free up resources, and even attempted the conversion during off-peak hours, but to no avail. The video is about 2 hours long, and I'm trying to convert it from .mkv to .mp4 format. \n\nI'm using Handbrake for the conversion, and it's always worked fine for smaller files. I'm not sure if the issue is with the server's hardware, the software, or the size of the video file itself. \n\nHas anyone else encountered this issue before? Any suggestions on how to troubleshoot this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
    "Hey everyone, I'm having a bit of an issue with my modded original Xbox. I've been trying to boot up a game but it just won't start. I've tried multiple games and none of them seem to work. The console itself turns on and seems to function normally until I try to start a game. Then it just freezes or goes to a black screen.\n\nI've checked all the connections and everything seems to be in order. I've also tried resetting the console multiple times but to no avail. The Xbox is modded with a custom dashboard and has been working fine until now. \n\nI'm not sure if the problem is with the mod or if it's a hardware issue. Has anyone else experienced this problem or have any suggestions on how to fix it? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
    "I've been seeing a lot of speculation and rumors floating around that Charmx is planning on leaving YouTube. I just wanted to share my thoughts on this and why I believe these rumors are unfounded.\n\nFirstly, Charmx has always been very open and transparent with his fanbase. If he were planning on leaving, I believe he would have made an announcement or at least hinted at it in one of his videos. So far, there has been no such indication from him.\n\nSecondly, Charmx has a very dedicated fanbase and his channel is still growing. It wouldn't make sense for him to leave at this point in his career when he's still gaining popularity and his content is being well-received.\n\nLastly, I think it's important to remember that YouTubers, like anyone else, need breaks. It's possible that Charmx might be taking some time off, which could explain his recent absence from the platform. This doesn't necessarily mean he's leaving for good.\n\nOf course, this is all just speculation on my part. Until Charmx himself confirms anything, it's best not to jump to conclusions. Let's continue to support him and enjoy his content!",
    "I'm not sure where to start. I've been a fan of the Wolfenstein series for years, and I was really looking forward to Young Blood. I had high hopes, but after just 10 minutes of gameplay, I'm left feeling disappointed and frustrated.\n\nThe first thing that hit me was the dialogue. It felt forced and unnatural, and the humor just didn't land. The characters didn't feel like they belonged in the Wolfenstein universe. They felt more like caricatures than actual characters.\n\nThe gameplay itself was also a letdown. The controls felt clunky and unresponsive, and the AI was just plain dumb. I found myself getting frustrated with the mechanics within the first few minutes.\n\nThe graphics were okay, but they didn't make up for the lackluster gameplay and poor dialogue. I was expecting so much more from this game, and it just didn't deliver.\n\nI'm going to give it another shot, but right now, I'm feeling pretty disheartened. I really wanted to love this game, but so far, it's just not living up to my expectations. I hope it gets better, but right now, I just feel like crying.",
    "I currently have a 3-year-old male cat named Oliver. He's been with me since he was a kitten and we've developed a strong bond. He's very playful, loves attention, and is generally well-behaved. He's also neutered and up-to-date on all his vaccinations.\n\nRecently, I've been considering adopting another cat. I work from home and have plenty of time to devote to my pets, but I can't help but feel that Oliver might benefit from having a companion, especially during the times when I'm busy. I've read that cats can get lonely and I don't want that for Oliver.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit worried about how Oliver will react to a new cat in the house. He's been the only pet for so long and I'm not sure how he'll handle sharing his space and my attention. I've also heard that introducing a new cat can be a stressful process for both the existing pet and the new one.\n\nI'm considering adopting a younger cat, maybe around 1 year old, in the hopes that Oliver might be more accepting of a younger, less threatening cat. I'm also prepared to keep them in separate rooms initially and gradually introduce them to each other.\n\nI'd love to hear from others who have introduced a new cat to their existing pet. How did it go? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.",
    "I've been DJing for a while now at local parties and I really enjoy it! I somehow manage to remember whether two songs will blend well based on their key, tempo and genre. But as my collection grew, I noticed it's getting quite difficult to keep track, especially with hundreds of songs in my arsenal. \n\nSo, I'm wondering if anyone has techniques, tips, or tools they use to remember which songs work well together? Do you categorize them in a certain way? Do you use software to help? Do you just remember by repeating enough times? Love to hear everyone's thoughts and suggestions. Thanks in advance!",
    "I don't mean to sound like I'm whining, but I feel quite ignored and underappreciated at home because my mom seems to interact more with her friends than with me. I get it, we all have lives, and sometimes we need that space to have adult conversations and escape the daily routine and responsibilities. But things have gotten a bit unbearable.\n\nShe is constantly on the phone with her friends, and it feels like she spends hours talking and laughing with them every single day. Sometimes I have to wait until the phone call ends to ask her something or start a conversation, which is often cut short because her phone rings again, and she has to grab it. If she's not on the phone, she's out for lunches, brunches, for evening walks or hanging out at one of her friend's house. \n\nI used to admire my mom's social life and her close-knit community of friends. They always seemed to support each other, have endless fun, and create profound memories. However, now, it just feels like I'm competing against them for my mom's attention. \n\nI feel sidelined and neglected, especially when she shares major news or gossips with her friends first before telling it to me. I’ve tried to express my feelings subtly and directly, but my attempts don't seem fruitful. She brushes it off as me being overly emotional or sensitive. Her justification is that I'm now an adult, and she doesn't need to tell me everything, but I can't shake the feeling that our bond is weakening due to this.\n\nI love my mom and really want to have a close relationship with her, but it feels like she’s pulling away. Any advice on how to bring this up to her without sounding selfish or needy would be appreciated. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you handle it? I'd love to hear your experiences and advice.\n",
    "Stress is something that we all experience in our lives, and it can come from a variety of sources such as work, school, relationships, or even just daily life.

    "I've been on Concerta for about two months now for my ADHD and while it has definitely helped me focus and stay on task, the side effects are starting to take a toll on me. I'm experiencing a loss of appetite, dry mouth, and occasional headaches. The most concerning side effect for me is the insomnia. I've always had a bit of trouble sleeping, but since starting Concerta, it's gotten significantly worse. \n\nI've tried taking it earlier in the day, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.

    "Hello everyone,\n\nTo shed some light on my situation, I’ve gone through many ups and downs over a span of 7 years. These years were filled with depression which seemed to constantly linger, no matter the changes I made in my life or the advice that was given to me by friends and family. It was like a shroud of darkness that refused to lift off me.\n\nDuring those years, I dealt with the pressures of college and trying to balance my life amidst all the assignments, classes, and social events. The mental toll was immense, and at times, the load was unbearable. The journey was hard and there were moments where I felt like a total failure. \n\nOn top of that, I had to face the ghosts of my past, particularly a turbulent childhood that left some deep emotional scars. Those memories haunted me and made it difficult to trust and form stable relationships. That led to a succession of relationships that mostly ended up enhancing my depression due to horrifying breakups.\n\nSelf-destructive behaviors became all too familiar for me. The number of times I’ve exploited myself, both physically and mentally, is countless. There didn't seem much to keep me from falling into a loop of negative thoughts and actions, again and again.\n\nBut enough is enough. \n\nI realized that the kind of help I need is not something that a friend, a relative, or a partner can give. My healing process needs to be guided by a professional, someone who understands not only the science but also the art of healing the human mind. Hence, I am proud to share that I'm finally going to see a psychiatrist. \n\nThe journey to improve myself, to discover the happy, healthy version of me, has finally begun. It's scary to think about the number of things I might have to confront during the therapy sessions, but I feel a sense of relief. Relief in knowing that I am taking the first real step towards a healthier me. \n\nI hope that sharing my story will encourage anyone else who is reading this and going through a similar situation, to seek help if you haven't yet. It's never too late to start improving and healing. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help. We are all a work in progress. \n\nThank you for reading this far. Here's to progress, healing, and brighter days ahead!",
    "I've been stewing over this for a while now and I just need to vent. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has experienced this, but it's been bothering me a lot lately. \n\nI'm talking about those situations where you're forced to make eye contact with someone, even when you're clearly uncomfortable. It's like some unwritten social rule that you have to look someone in the eyes when you're talking to them, but why? Why is it so important? \n\nI'm not talking about situations where it's necessary, like job interviews or important meetings. I get that. I'm talking about everyday situations, like casual conversations or even just passing someone in the hallway. \n\nI'm an introvert and I have social anxiety. Making eye contact is really hard for me. It makes me feel exposed and vulnerable. I feel like I'm being judged or scrutinized. It's just really uncomfortable. \n\nBut people seem to take it personally if you don't make eye contact. They think you're being rude or that you're not interested in what they're saying. But that's not it at all. I'm just trying to protect myself. \n\nI wish people would understand that not everyone is comfortable with eye contact. It's not a personal slight. It's just a coping mechanism. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Or am I just overreacting? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

Like there is this mental block or a disconnect between what I am thinking and my ability to verbalize it.

Other times, however, it's just a simple thought or feeling which should ideally be easy to communicate. \n\nThings like explaining a movie plot, describing a piece of art or literature, expressing how I feel about a certain person or situation...heck even explaining why I like some types of music seems like climbing Mount Everest.

    "I'm a 34-year-old female and I've been in a committed relationship with my partner, a 33-year-old male, for nearly a decade now. Things were all sunshine and daisies in the beginning, like every relationship I suppose. But lately, all I feel is a sense of overbearing dread. I have reached a point where I am absolutely fed up with his behavior, and at the risk of sounding brash, I'd say his shit is making life unbearable.\n\nHis lack of effort and irresponsibility has started to damage our relationship. He has become complacent and shows little to no initiative to make things work. Laundry piled up for days, dishes untouched in the sink, bills unpaid, chores unattended - he seems to avoid any form of responsibility. It feels more like I have another child to take care of rather than a partner.\n\nApart from the day-to-day tasks that he shirks, he has stopped showing the affection and attention I need. It feels like our conversations have become a mere exchange of information rather than intimate conversations we once had. Simple gestures of love and care like a goodbye kiss before work or a cuddle in the morning are rare occasions now.\n\nHis temper has also become a major problem. He is quick to get angry over trivial matters and his tendency to lash out verbally is distressing. Despite my countless attempts to communicate my distress and discomfort about his anger issues, he dismisses them and never acknowledges the impact on our relationship.\n\nInitially, I thought these were just phases and things would get better. However, repeated occurrences of these habits and behaviors have led me to believe that he will not change. I've tried proposing therapy or couples counselling, but he isn't open to these suggestions.\n\nI'm at a point of absolute mental exhaustion, and I am seeking advice from the Reddit community. I invested my time, energy, and emotions in this relationship hoping that we would grow and evolve together. But now, I'm starting to question if it's worth all the struggle. \n\nHas anyone else been in this situation? What did you do? How do you confront a partner who refuses to take responsibility or acknowledge the problems in a relationship?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would be extremely helpful.",
    "I've been sitting here for the past hour just trying to process what I've been through tonight and I finally decided that I needed to get it off my chest. I apologize in advance for the rant, but I honestly don't know where else to turn.\n\nTo be frank, tonight was something out of one of those horribly scripted comedy movies where things go from bad to worse until it's just absolutely ridiculous.\n\nSo I've had my eye on this new restaurant in town, an Italian place that's been getting rave reviews. I'd gathered a group of friends to go and try it out. Little did we know, we were in for a disaster.\n\nFirst, they misplaced our reservation and we had to wait an additional 45 minutes before our table was ready. Then, the appetizers we ordered came out cold, as if they'd been sitting there for a while. When we brought this to the attention of our waiter, he looked more annoyed than apologetic. Regardless, we thought we would give them another chance with the main courses.\n\nAs fate would have it, two out of the five orders were wrong and one of my friend's meal came out a whopping 20 minutes after the rest of ours. When we tasted the food...it was downright awful.\n\nIt seemed like we were stuck in a streak of misfortune. Once the bill finally came, they had overcharged us, including dishes we hadn't even ordered. After another argument with the waiter – who by now I sincerely believe hated us – we managed to get it sorted, having wasted an additional half hour.\n\nUltimately, we ended up leaving with our appetites unsatisfied, feeling terribly frustrated, and vowing never to set foot there again. \n\nI've actually never had such terrible service and food at the same time. I'm really trying not to be overly critical or anything. Maybe it was just an off night for them, but it was honestly the worst experience. I'm just sharing my experience here so that others might be aware.\n\nAnyways, thanks for letting me vent. Here's hoping for a better dining experience next time!",
    "Hey, Reddit community, I am currently navigating through a complex situation in my life and I need your advice on how to handle it. \n\nI'm 21 years old and I still live with my parents. I recently got a job offer in another state and I want to take up that opportunity as I feel like it's a good career step for me. However, I am unsure of how to approach my parents about it. They are, understandably, protective of me and are pretty resistant to the idea of me living somewhere else. \n\nThe problem is, we are really close as a family and they are used to having me around. However, I feel like this job opportunity is something that would grow me personally and professionally. It's not that I want to burn bridges or reciprocate their love any less, but I feel this move could be good for me. It's just tough because I know they will find it hard to understand and accept. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice about what to say or how to broach this subject? Any personal experiences you can share about having the \"leaving the nest\" conversation would also be much appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",
    "I turned 25 yesterday, a milestone birthday in my life. My friends have been planning something special for a week, and considering the pandemic situation, I was looking forward to it quite ardiously. We decided to have an online gaming party since we all shared an interest in gaming and could not meet in person.\n\nWhile everything was going smooth and enjoyable, we suddenly saw a new username pop up. It was my on-and-off again ex-boyfriend, who we'll call John. John and I have a long history and have broken up and mended so many times. My friends didn't invite him keeping in mind our recent fight which ended up in us splitting again.\n\nJohn didn't waste much time and started taunting me with sneaky comments initially but soon it was more direct and hurtful. He brought up all the things that went wrong in our relationship, blaming me for everything and belittling my life decisions. His words were sharp and felt like daggers. I asked him to stop; my friends tried to kick him out of the game. Unfortunately, he had created multiple accounts. The celebration mood was completely ruined, and I ended up leaving the party early, almost in tears. It was as if my feelings and my special day didn't mean anything to him. It feels stupid to be so affected by words on a screen, but they truly hurt.\n\nI want to put this behind me and move on but the things he said, they keep resonating in my head. I know it's not right to let him affect my peace so much, but I feel so shaken up right now. I'm posting this here to vent and seeking advice on how to handle this. It was supposed to be a happy day, but those harsh words have cast a dark shadow over what was a great birthday celebration. How do you shake off such negativity and regain your composure? Any kind words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated.",

The connection seems to be constantly interrupting, which is quite frustrating. \n\nI've noticed that the signal strength fluctuates a lot, even when I'm in areas where I know the signal should be strong.

    "Certainly, it's easy to judge someone based on a single bad action they may have done. It's like a straightforward equation: action+outcome=judgment. However, I think life is a bit more complex than that and so are humans. \n\nEvery action we make usually has a story behind it. Let's consider the criminal convicted for theft. Yes, their action was undoubtedly wrong and should face the consequences. But, what if necessity drove them to that path? Maybe they were desperate to feed a sick child, to pay mounting debts or because they lost their job in the middle of a pandemic? Are they pure evil or just victims of an unfortunate circumstance?\n\nOr let's consider a person we know who may have lied, cheated or hurt someone. Of course, these actions are reprehensible. But what if they did it out of fear, pressure or because of untreated mental health issues? Again, it doesn't justify the action, but it provides some context. \n\nI'm not saying we should completely absolve people of their wrongdoings because of their circumstances or intentions. Each person should be accountable for their actions. However, I'm merely suggesting that perhaps we should look at the entire picture before passing judgment. Understanding the reasons behind a bad action doesn't make someone an advocate for it. It simply separates the person from the action and allows for empathy, growth and potential change. \n\nHow do you all feel about this? Can you share a situation where you realized that there was more to someone's bad action than what met the eye?",

    "I've recently started playing Might and Magic 6 (MM6) and I've got a unique idea for my party set-up. I'm considering playing with a full party of archers. I feel it could be an interesting challenge and a fresh way to experience the game.\n\nOf course, I realize that without a balanced party, certain limitations will arise, particularly in the healing or melee departments. But I also can envision certain strategic advantages including high ranged DPS and the ability to focus on boosting a single defensive stat (light/leather armor).\n\nHas anyone tried this playstyle? What has been your experience, and what advice would you give to someone who wants to try it out? \n\nMy second question pertains to the gameplay in MM6. I am choosing between real time and turn based. Specifically, how much does it change the game's feel or challenge? From what I understand, real time tends to be faster but more chaotic, while turn-based allows for more calculated decisions. Will a full party of archers be better off or worse in either mode? \n\nI hope to hear some interesting insights from fellow fans of the game. Thank you in advance for your responses!",
    "I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I feel like I need to talk about this. I've been struggling with something for a while now and it's getting to the point where it's really affecting my mental health.\n\nI'm a male victim of emotional and physical abuse, and for a long time, I've been hesitant to open up about it. There's this societal expectation that, as a man, I'm supposed to be strong and invincible, incapable of being hurt emotionally or physically, especially by a woman. Added to that, the fear of being laughed at, humiliated or simply not being believed makes it even tougher to break the silence.\n\nThe abuse happened in my previous relationship and it lasted for three years before I had the courage to leave. I was regularly manipulated, belittled, and physically assaulted. It's left me with some deep emotional scars that I'm still working through. Despite having removed myself from that situation, the echoes of it still affect my daily life, from my self-esteem to trust issues in new relationships.\n\nThe most crushing part about all of this, is the isolation. It's like I'm trapped in a cage made of fear and shame. None of my close friends or family members know about this, and it's eating me up inside. The stigma around male abuse victims is deafening. Most people are surprised to learn that men can be victims too, and this disbelief adds to the reasons why I’ve remained silent.\n\nI'm posting this here because I need someone to talk to. I know sharing this might not fix everything, but I think it's the first step in the right direction. I just want to stop hiding in my own shadow, and take steps toward healing.\n\nIf there's anyone else in this community who's been through similar experiences, words of advice and solidarity would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",
    "I've been with my girlfriend for about a year now and we've had a pretty healthy sexual relationship up until recently. A few weeks ago, she told me that she's been feeling uncomfortable with our sexual activities and isn't sure if she wants to continue them. She didn't give me a clear reason, just that she's been feeling this way for a while now. \n\nI'm really confused and hurt by this. I've always made sure to prioritize her comfort and consent in our relationship, and I thought we were both happy with our sex life. I've asked her if I did something wrong or if there's something she wants to change about our sexual activities, but she just says she doesn't know. \n\nI love her and I want to respect her feelings, but I'm also worried about what this means for our relationship. I don't want to pressure her into anything she's not comfortable with, but I also don't want to be in a relationship where I'm constantly worried about whether or not she's okay with being intimate with me. \n\nI'm not sure what to do or how to approach this situation. I want to be supportive and understanding, but I also have my own needs and feelings to consider. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "¡Hola a todos!\n\nHoy comienza mi viaje para aprender español, otra vez. Hace unos años, tomé algunas clases de español en la escuela secundaria, pero desde entonces, he olvidado la mayoría de lo que aprendí. Recientemente, me di cuenta de cuánto me encanta la cultura hispana y cuánto me gustaría poder comunicarme con fluidez en español. Así que aquí estoy, comprometiéndome a aprender español de nuevo.\n\nMi plan es utilizar una combinación de recursos en línea, libros de texto y, si es posible, clases en persona. También estoy considerando la posibilidad de hacer intercambios de idiomas con hablantes nativos de español. Creo que la inmersión es una de las mejores maneras de aprender un idioma, así que también planeo ver películas y escuchar música en español.\n\nEstoy emocionado por este viaje y espero poder compartir mis progresos con todos ustedes. Si tienen algún consejo o recurso que crean que podría ser útil, por favor no duden en compartirlo. ¡Gracias por leer y deséenme suerte!\n\nHasta la próxima,\n[Your Name]",
    "The Mil-Sim category in games has always intrigued me, but I've never really understood its purpose. I mean, I get that it's short for \"military simulation\" and it's supposed to provide a more realistic combat experience. But isn't that what all shooter games aim to do? \n\nWhat sets Mil-Sim games apart from other shooter games? Is it the level of detail in the gameplay? The accuracy of the weapons? The tactics used? Or is it just a marketing term to attract a certain type of gamer? \n\nI've played a few Mil-Sim games and while I enjoyed them, I didn't really notice a huge difference compared to other shooter games. Maybe I'm missing something? \n\nI'd love to hear from other gamers who are more familiar with this category. What do you think is the point of the Mil-Sim category? What makes these games unique? And do you think they provide a better gaming experience?",
    "I have a younger brother who is 16 years old, and he has started noticing his thinning hair. He's taking it rather hard, and I've never seen him this upset. I've been using finasteride (fin) for my hair loss issues for the last few years now and it's been incredibly beneficial for me. \n\nI've discussed this with our parents and they're indifferent about it, and think it's his decision. I worry if he weren't to properly research or come across some misleading information, he might end up with a less effective or potentially harmful solution. So, I've been considering talking to him about fin, its benefits, and also it's possible side effects.\n\nI understand it's ultimately his decision to deal with his hair loss, but as his elder brother, I think I am in better position to guide him. However, I have some reservations. Fin does have its own potential side effects which, though rare, can turn serious. \n\nCould it be seen as projecting my own experiences or solutions onto him? Also, if he does suffer from any side effects, I can't help but feel I would be responsible.\n\nDo you think I should discuss fin with him? If yes, how do I approach this without making it seem like I'm forcing him into it? Any advice would be much appreciated.",
    "I've recently stumbled upon an artist called \"XYZ\" while browsing through Spotify. The music is very to my taste and I had fallen in love with their discography. However, after a few days, my friend informed me that controversy had embroiled this particular artist involving accusations of inappropriate behavior. I don't condone such actions and it's really bothering me.\n\nAs noted, the artist's music does resonate with me though. But now the knowledge of these accusations has tainted my enjoyment somewhat. I'm in a dilemma here. Is it still okay for me to listen to their music?\n\nI'd love to hear how you all balance your enjoyment for someone's music with any disapproval you may have of their personal conduct. Also, do you think me listening to the music indirectly supports the artist's alleged behavior?\n\nI appreciate your responses!",
    "Has anyone else been experiencing glitches and money issues since the recent pack and update? I've been playing the game for a while now and never had any problems until this update. \n\nFirstly, I've noticed that my Sims are not able to complete certain actions.

My Sims are earning money from their jobs, but the money doesn't seem to be added to my household funds. I've tried moving them out and back in, but the money still doesn't show up. \n\nI've also noticed that the game has been crashing more frequently since the update. It's really frustrating because I've put a lot of time and effort into my game and I don't want to lose my progress. \n\nI've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, but the problems persist. I've also checked to make sure my game is up to date and it is. \n\nIs anyone else experiencing these issues? Any advice on how to fix them?

    "I've been trying to get into this game for a week now, and I just can't do it. I've tried different strategies, different characters, different play styles, but nothing seems to work. The game mechanics are confusing, the community is toxic, and the learning curve is just too steep. I've spent hours watching tutorials and reading guides, but I still feel like I'm just floundering around, not really accomplishing anything.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I've heard so many good things about it, and I was excited to dive in and become part of the community. But after a week of frustration and disappointment, I've decided it's just not for me. I'm going to uninstall it and move on to something else.\n\nI know a lot of you love this game, and I'm not trying to bash it or anything. It's just not the game for me.

    "Lately, I've been in a consistent downswing of mood over the past few months. It feels like every single day is a struggle. Every morning when I wake up, I just feel this indescribable heaviness, almost like I'm being weighed down by my own thoughts and emotions. Most days, it's a struggle to even get out of bed. \n\nI've tried everything – meditation, exercise, diet, sleep hygiene, therapy – but nothing seems to be sticking. Some days are definitely better than others, but it seems like the bad days outweigh the good ones at the moment. It's this constant ebb and flow that's really draining me, just this feeling that I'm taking one step forward and two steps back. \n\nI'm asking for any advice. Has anyone else been through this? How did you manage to navigate through all this darkness? I want to believe that there's light at the end of the tunnel. But right now, it's just so hard to see. \n\nI understand if no one has the energy or capacity to respond. I guess I just needed to write this down and let it out somewhere.

    "I'm writing this post today to shed some light on the situation of atheists in Bangladesh right now. Although Bangladesh is a constitutionally secular country, atheism and secular thought are topics that are unfortunately met with aggression, hostility and sometimes, outright violence in many parts of the country.\n\nThe rising tide of religious fundamentalism has cast a shadow on free thinkers, atheists, agnostics and secular bloggers. In the recent years, there has been an alarming spurt in incidents of violence - religiously motivated killings of those critical of religious fundamentalism and claimed atheists.\n\nOne could say that atheists in Bangladesh live in a state where they cannot openly express their beliefs or critique religion without a constantly looming fear of reprisal from extremist factions. Not just physical violence, but the threat extends to legal repercussions as well - \"hurting religious sentiments\" could lead to legal trouble, causing atheists to self-censor and stay silent.\n\nOn the positive side, there is a certain number of Bangladeshi atheists who are relentlessly fighting for secular space, but they do so at great personal risk. The creation and growth of anonymous online platforms have enabled these individuals to express their ideas and form a community, which seems to be growing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is grim, there are brave people attempting to push for change. However, it's apparent that there is a long struggle ahead. The international community must prioritize pressuring the Bangladesh government to ensure the safety and freedom of speech for all its citizens regardless of their religious beliefs, or lack thereof.",
    "The rule that employees must get a doctor's note for being out sick always seemed a bit excessive to me. If an employee is sick, we surely want them to rest and recover, not further exhaust themselves by dragging themselves to a doctor's office just to get a written excuse. And let's not forget about the fact that this potentially exposes others at the medical center to the illness, and puts additional strain on our healthcare system.\n\nNot to mention that many folks might not have the time, money, or resources to see the doctor every time they have a minor illness that can be otherwise recovered from at home with proper rest and over-the-counter remedies. It seems like the healthcare system is already overburdened as is, without folks having to take time off work to make unnecessary doctor visits.\n\nAnd lastly, I think it's also worth considering that making this requirement might discourage sick employees from even taking a day off. This potentially endangers others in the workplace and can significantly hinder recovery and productivity. It seems to me like it would be more beneficial to trust employees when they say they're sick and encourage them to stay home and recover instead. \n\nWhat are your experiences with this? Are there alternatives that could work better?",

I'm writing this post because I've been going through a lot lately and I feel like this community might be able to offer some support or advice. \n\nAbout a month ago, I finally gathered the courage to come out as gay to my friends and family.

    "I've been thinking a lot about the Jimmy story recently and wanted to share my thoughts and hear yours. \n\nFirstly, I think the character development of Jimmy was really well done. The way he evolved from a naive, innocent boy to a mature, understanding man was portrayed beautifully. His struggles, his victories, his losses, everything was so relatable and real. \n\nHowever, I do have some issues with the plot. There were certain parts that felt rushed and some plot points that were left unresolved. For example, the storyline with Jimmy's estranged father was introduced but never really explored. I feel like there was a missed opportunity there to delve deeper into Jimmy's past and his emotional baggage.\n\nAlso, the ending felt a bit abrupt to me. I understand the need for open-ended stories but I feel like Jimmy's story deserved a more concrete conclusion. \n\nDespite these issues, I still enjoyed the story overall.

    "Anime endings have always been a contentious topic among fans. There are numerous instances where a seemingly great series is \"ruined\" for an individual viewer due to a poorly constructed or unsatisfactory ending. Unfortunately, a perceived pattern seems to be forming in the anime industry these days, causing growing concern among viewers.\n\nFor starters, there is an increasing tendency toward rushed endings. Stories that have been built up over two, three, or even four seasons are sometimes crammed into a single last episode. This often leads to a lack of characterization and development, inconsistencies, and plot holes. It feels as if the series was cut short due to time or budget constraints.\n\nSecondly, there has been a noticeable increase in ambiguous endings. While not always a bad thing, when used excessively it begins to feel like a cheap cop-out or a way to leave things open for potential sequels. Many viewers are left feeling frustrated when they've invested time in a series only to be handed an ending that requires them to fill in their blanks.\n\nLastly, we've seen the rise of \"shock value\" endings. These endings seem to be designed primarily to get a reaction from the viewer rather than to serve the narrative or characters. They often involve dramatic plot twists or character deaths that feel forced or out of left field.\n\nThese three trends combined make it increasingly common for anime fans to walk away from a series with a bad taste due to the ending, despite having enjoyed the rest of the series. It's a worrying trend. An ending is the last thing viewers remember about a series, and a bad ending can tarnish the entire viewing experience.\n\nThat being said, it’s essential to remember that creating an ending that satisfies everyone is nearly impossible, and the judgement of an ending is incredibly subjective. Some may enjoy a more open ending which leaves them pondering, meanwhile, others find satisfaction in clear conclusions. However, recognizing patterns and avoiding repetition can ensure diverse, well-thought-out endings that don't get a barrage of hate.\n\nSo, what do you guys think about this trend? Have you noticed it as well, or do you think there is a different issue when it comes to anime endings? Let's discuss!",
    "Hello fellow Redditors,\n\nI remember watching a whimsical cartoon movie on Netflix a while back, somewhere around 2017-2018. As far as I can remember, the main characters were these furry, colorful creatures. They all had their own unique personalities, and they resided in this vibrant and imaginative world full of bizarre creatures and structures.\n\nThe movie had a really endearing storyline about friendship and overcoming challenges. It wasn't just a typical kiddie movie, as it had some deep layers and themes that were probably meant to resonate more with the adult audience, which I found pretty interesting.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't remember the name of this movie for the life of me. I tried scouring Netflix to no avail, and I suspect they might've taken it down. I'm guessing it wasn't really popular or mainstream, as I don't recall any big marketing hype around it. I really hope someone remembers the film I'm talking about and can tell me the name.\n\nAny help is appreciated, guys! Thanks in advance!",
    "I am posting this to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment about the continuous stream of disrespectful memes concerning the recent passing of Prince Philip spreading across the internet. It's astounding to witness how my generation, gen z, which is well-known for advocating respect, inclusivity, and empathy, seems to blatantly disrespect such a grave and heartbreaking matter.\n\nFor those who may argue that it's just humor, I think it's crucial to understand that there is a line between humor and disrespect - a line that seems to have been ignored in this circumstance. The passing of Prince Philip, who served and represented the United Kingdom for several decades, deserves much more respect than what it is currently receiving, even from those who may not necessarily agree with or support the monarchy.\n\nWhen did we become a generation that finds amusement in death? This recent event has made me question certain aspects of the online gen z community. I am aware that not everyone shares this perspective, and it's not meant as an attack towards anyone, but I believe that we need to promote more respect and kindness rather than using someone's death as a source of entertainment.\n\nHumor and satire are subjective, and I completely understand that. However, a line must be drawn when it ventures into the territory of insensitivity and disrespect. This creates a toxic and harmful environment that erodes the core values of empathy and respect that we always advocate for.\n\nWe must remember that behind every meme, there's a real human being affected. Today it's Prince Philip, and tomorrow it may be someone we deeply care about and love. It's crucial to think twice before supporting, sharing, or creating something controversial like these memes. No one deserves to have their death made light of.\n\nThis is just a polite reminder for all of us, me included, to think before we act, to ensure that we do not turn into the insensitive, unempathetic people we claim not to be. Let's uphold respect, even for people who have lived lives vastly different from our own.",
    "I've been friends with my best friend, let's call him Jake, for about 5 years now. We've always been super close, shared secrets, and supported each other through thick and thin.

It was a mutual decision and we ended on good terms, but it was still a tough time for me. \n\nDuring this period, Jake was there for me, like he always has been.

I don't want to ruin our friendship, but I can't ignore these feelings. I also don't want to rebound onto him because that wouldn't be fair. I'm not sure if this is just a phase because of my recent breakup or if I genuinely have feelings for him. \n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

    "After years of being an active comic books fanatic, I've noticed that the topic of a characters' healing factor abilities is something of a contentious issue among many fandoms. Primarily, it seems, the debate revolves around the question of \"Who has the best healing factor?\"\n\nA lot of comic book characters in both Marvel and DC universe have healing factors - the ability to recover from any injury at a superhuman rate. Wolverine, Deadpool, Hulk on Marvel's side, Superman, Doomsday, Wonder Woman on DC’s side, the list goes on. While some heal from injuries or illnesses at a rapid pace, others can regenerate lost limbs or, at their most powerful, pull themselves back together from just a single cell.\n\nHowever, the speeds and limits at which these characters can heal vary drastically. For example, a select few can recover from an injury instantly. Others take a more gradual amount of time. There’s also the question of the severity of the injury. Can they regenerate after being decimated? Or does it take a less traumatic event for their healing to kick in?\n\nIn my opinion, the healing factor shouldn't be the only parameter to measure their power. Characters are so much more than that. I also think it’s important to read into the specifics of these healing factors rather than focusing on the “who would win in a fight” debate. The healing factor ability also leads into discussions about immortality, ageing, resistance to toxins, etc.\n\nHowever, I'm really interested in hearing what other fans think about this. Do you believe one character has a stronger healing factor than another? Do you consider fast healing as the highest power? Or in the end, do you think it’s all subjective depending on the writer at the time? Is there a need for more consistent rules regarding these abilities? Let's have a discussion! I really look forward to seeing everyone’s viewpoints.",
    "I was diagnosed with ADHD in my late teens and the way it manifested was mostly through difficulty concentrating, hyperactivity, impulsivity, forgetfulness and disorganization.

    "So, I've been driving for Uber for about a year now and I've had my fair share of interesting passengers. But this one takes the cake. \n\nI picked up this guy from a local bar around 11 PM. He was dressed in the most flamboyant outfit I've ever seen - think Elton John meets Liberace. He was friendly and chatty, and we had a good conversation during the ride. \n\nAs we approached his house, he suddenly turned to me and said, \"Hey, why don't you come in for a drink?\" I was taken aback.

It was definitely one of the most memorable rides I've had. Has anyone else had similar experiences?",
    "Hey there fellow Dota 2 players, \n\nI just wanted to share some interesting updates on Viper in the custom game lineup. As we all know, Viper was already a pretty strong character with a great set of abilities. However, it seems Viper has received a buff in the custom game lineup that has been significantly increasing his performance in gameplay.\n\nThe buff mainly affects Viper's Poison Attack. The damage and the duration of the debuff have both been rescaled. The damage has been increased to 2/2.5/3/3.5% software (previously 1.5/2.25/3/3.75%) and the debuff now lasts for 3/3.6/4.2/4.8 seconds (previously 2/2.5/3/3.5). \n\nOther noticeable changes include the increase in Viper's agility gain to 3.3 (previously 2.8) which is pretty notable. Also, the cooldown of Nethertoxin has been reduced to 6 seconds (previously 8).\n\nIn my opinion, these adjustments have made Viper more potent in custom games. The buffs to his skill set and upgrades in his core stats seem to have combined well and improved his ability to dominate matches. However, as with any updates and buffs, I think it might take a few games to adjust to the changes and explore the new gaming style with Viper. I have already started practicing a new strategy and can't wait to perfect it.\n\nDo share your thoughts and experiences on how you're utilizing these new enhancements with Viper. I'm interested to know how these buffs have changed your game with this character.\n\nHappy gaming!\n",

    "I can't believe it, but it finally happened. We actually ran out of toilet paper. Given the amount we usually buy and how we were stocked up during the whole pandemic panic as a precaution, I never thought I would see the day.\n\nWe live a few hours away from the nearest grocery store, so we planned our shopping trips meticulously, accounting for each item. Not today, though. We slightly misjudged the consumption rate of our holy grail - toilet paper.\n\nNow that leaves us with too many options to contemplate. Do we drive all the way to town for just getting toilet paper? Or do we try the much-dreaded bidet? Paper Towels are a clog risk, aren't they? Leaves seem environmentally friendly but, well, icky? I also remember reading somewhere about reusable cloth toilet paper, but that again begs the question about the cleaning process. \n\nI think, for now, we might use our stock of tissue papers but that would not last long. Also on another thought, why are we still dependent on toilet paper in the time of such advanced technology? Eh, just a thought to ponder upon! \n\nHow about you guys?

    "I've been playing Destiny 2 for a while now and I've noticed an issue with the middle tree sentinel's interaction with stasis that I think needs to be addressed. \n\nWhen I'm using the middle tree sentinel subclass (Code of the Commander) and I throw my void wall grenade into a group of enemies frozen by stasis, it doesn't seem to do any damage. I've tested this multiple times and the result is always the same. The void detonators that are supposed to attach to enemies and explode are not triggering. \n\nThis is a significant issue because it essentially nullifies the effectiveness of the sentinel's void wall grenade when playing with teammates who are using stasis. It's frustrating because it feels like I'm being penalized for my teammates' choice of subclass. \n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or if it's an intentional design choice, but either way, I think it needs to be fixed. The sentinel's abilities should work consistently, regardless of what subclasses my teammates are using. \n\nI'm curious to know if anyone else has experienced this issue and if there's a workaround that I'm not aware of. Also, if anyone from Bungie is reading this, please consider looking into this issue. Thanks!",
    "Hello fellow Fiero enthusiasts!\n\nI am selling my beloved 1988 Pontiac Fiero Formula. I have owned this car for about 5 years now, and it has been an absolute joy to drive. However, I am in need of a larger vehicle now, which leaves me no choice but to part ways with my Fiero.\n\nThe car is mostly stock, with original white paint and grey interior. The upholstery is in pretty good condition considering its age, with minor wear and no major tearing. It has 98k miles on the analog/digital gauge cluster. The heart of the vehicle runs smooth - a 2.8L V6 engine, automatic transmission. Gets great gas mileage. \n\nI would like to highlight some of the maintenance work I have done on this over the years:\n- New brakes \n- Alternator \n- Water pump \n- Full tune-up including spark plugs, wires, cap, rotor \n- Transmission serviced \n- New tires\n\nHere are few things that will need attention: \n- AC does not blow cold, although the heater works fine.\n- Power locks are a bit finicky and need some TLC\n- There is a small oil leak which I have not been able to pinpoint yet\n\nI am asking $5000, but the price can be slightly negotiable for a serious buyer. This is a great little 2-seater sports car for any Fiero enthusiast, or someone looking to start a restoration project. More pictures and information available upon request. Local pick up preferred, but willing to discuss shipping options on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPlease, no lowball offers and serious inquiries only. Feel free to DM me with any questions or if you want to check out the car in person. \n\nThank you for looking, Fiero community!",
    "I've been having an issue with my Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) headset for a while now. It constantly goes into sleep mode even when I'm actively using it. This is incredibly frustrating as it interrupts my gaming sessions and other VR activities. \n\nI've tried adjusting the power settings on my PC, ensuring that the USB ports aren't set to power down, and I've even tried different USB ports. I've also made sure that the headset's sensors are clean and unobstructed. Despite all these efforts, the problem persists. \n\nThe headset works perfectly fine when it's active, but it just randomly decides to go to sleep. Sometimes it happens after a few minutes, sometimes after an hour. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to it. \n\nI'm using the latest version of Windows 10 and all my drivers are up to date. I've also tried reinstalling the WMR software, but that didn't help either. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue? Any suggestions on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
    "I've been in the VR&E program for approximately a year now, working towards my bachelor's degree, and I'm starting to contemplate the next step of my educational journey - obtaining a master's degree. My plan is to use the benefits available through the VR&E program; however, I've heard that in order to justify this, you really need to prove that your career goals require a master's level education.\n\nCurrently, I am majoring in Computer Science and I aim to pursue a career in Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML). From the research I've done and the professionals I've talked to, it seems quite clear that a post-graduate degree would enable me to secure higher-level positions or make meaningful contributions in these fields. Moreover, I've found numerous job postings requiring or preferring a master’s degree in these areas.\n\nIs seeking a master's degree through VR&E a realistic goal? If so, could anyone who has successfully navigated this process provide some insight or suggestions on how to best demonstrate the necessity of a master’s degree for my career aspirations? I am particularly interested in hearing about how you communicated with your VR&E counselor, and any evidence or documentation you used to support your request. Any advice you could give would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",
    "I'm sorry if this post is a bit heavy, but I really need to vent and I don't know where else to turn. I just got back from what was supposed to be a relaxing vacation, but now that I'm home, all the stress and anxiety that I was trying to escape from has come rushing back. \n\nThe vacation was great, don't get me wrong. I was able to forget about my problems for a while and just enjoy myself. But now that I'm back, it's like nothing has changed. I'm still stuck in the same job that I hate, I'm still dealing with the same personal issues, and I'm still feeling the same overwhelming sense of hopelessness and despair.\n\nI know that suicide is not the answer, and I'm not planning on doing anything drastic. But I can't help but feel like I'm trapped in a cycle that I can't escape from. I'm tired of feeling like this, and I don't know what to do.\n\nI'm sorry for the depressing post. I just needed to get this off my chest. If anyone has any advice or words of encouragement, I would really appreciate it.",
    "I've been friends with this person for a few years now. We've shared a lot of good times and they've been there for me during some of my darkest moments. I genuinely love them and appreciate their presence in my life. However, recently, I've started to feel uncomfortable around them.\n\nIt's not that they've done anything wrong or harmful. It's just that their behavior and attitude have started to change. They've become more negative and critical, often making snide remarks or belittling others. They've also started to invade my personal space, which makes me feel uneasy. I've tried to talk to them about it, but they either brush it off or get defensive.\n\nI don't want to lose this friendship, but at the same time, I can't ignore my feelings of discomfort. I'm torn between preserving our relationship and prioritizing my own well-being. I'm not sure how to navigate this situation without hurting them or myself.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice or insights you guys could offer. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Thanks in advance.",
    "As a hardcore Dead by Daylight player, I have encountered the incessant problem of killers camping every single game, especially at the red rank, as solo survivors. As a solo survivor, this becomes particularly discouraging and frustrating, hindering any real progress in the game. \n\nCamping, for those unfamiliar, refers to the strategy used by killers where they remain near a hooked survivor refusing to leave, which denies survivors the chance to rescue and oftentimes ensuring their demise. It is somewhat perplexing and irritating considering we are supposed to be dealing with the 'cream of the crop' killers at this rank.\n\nFrankly, this tactic doesn't challenge survivors' gameplay or strategy. It rather relies on exploiting an easy tactic to get a kill as opposed to genuinely earning it. This makes the game not only tedious, but weakening the overall competitive spirit the game is designed to enforce. \n\nThe problem is further compounded by the inability of solo-survivor teams to communicate effectively. At lower ranks, or in survivor friends (SWF) groups, communication circumvents this by helping to distract the killer or applying pressure to the map elsewhere, forcing the killer to abandon the survivor. \n\nHowever, in higher rank play where many survivors are playing solo, lack of communication relieves the killer of these pressures. The inability to coordinate distraction tactics or split objectives often leads to a swift death for the hooked survivor and ultimately results in the killer’s victory.\n\nThe crux of the matter thus presented is how to deal with the camping issue especially for red-rank solo survivors? The developers need to think about this and come up with some possible solutions. It might be beneficial to implement stricter penalties for camping, or perhaps a better communication system for survivors?\n\nIt is understandable that every player has a different strategy and it's part of the fun trying to adapt and counteract. But applying such tactics can become frustrating for other players, turning the game into a monotonous sequence of events that can ultimately destroy the gaming community.\n\nOpen to thoughts, suggestions, or any possible solutions to this! Hoping the community can come together on this topic and induce some changes.",
    "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm reaching out to this community in hopes of finding some support and advice. My 2.5-year-old son was recently diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. This has been a very difficult time for our family as we try to navigate this new reality.\n\nFor those who may not know, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition where the heart's ability to pump blood is decreased because the heart's main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, is enlarged and weakened. This diagnosis came as a shock to us, as our son has always been a very active and seemingly healthy child.\n\nWe are currently working with a team of pediatric cardiologists who are helping us manage his condition. He is on medication and we are monitoring his condition closely. However, the uncertainty of the situation is very stressful. \n\nI'm reaching out to see if there are any other parents here who have gone through a similar situation. Any advice on how to cope, what to expect, or resources that you found helpful would be greatly appreciated. We are also interested in hearing about any lifestyle changes that could potentially help manage his condition.\n\nThank you in advance for your support and advice. It means the world to us during this challenging time.",
    "I was raised in a Christian household, with church every Sunday, Bible study, and prayer before meals. It was a significant part of my upbringing and shaped a lot of my values and beliefs. However, as I've grown older and experienced more of the world, I've started to feel a disconnect with my faith.\n\nI don't mean to offend anyone, but Christianity, as I've known it, feels cheesy to me now. The sermons, the hymns, the rituals, they all seem to lack the depth and complexity that I see in the world around me. It's like I've outgrown the simplistic narratives and moral lessons that were so comforting and reassuring when I was a child.\n\nI've tried to discuss this with my family and friends from church, but they don't seem to understand. They see my doubts and questions as a crisis of faith, a temptation to be resisted, rather than a natural part of growing and evolving as a person.\n\nI'm not sure what I believe anymore. I still feel a connection to the teachings of Jesus, especially his emphasis on love, compassion, and forgiveness. But the institutionalized religion, with its dogma and rituals, feels more like a cultural artifact than a living, breathing faith.\n\nI'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. How did you navigate this transition? Did you find a way to reconcile your evolving worldview with your religious upbringing, or did you end up leaving the faith altogether? I'm feeling a bit lost and would appreciate any insights or advice.",
    "I've been struggling with a problem for a while now and I'm hoping someone here might have some advice. I can't seem to stop eating take out or late-night snacks. It's become a habit that's hard to break. I work late hours and by the time I get home, I'm too tired to cook. So, I end up ordering take out or grabbing something quick and unhealthy. \n\nI've noticed that this habit is starting to affect my health and my wallet. I've gained weight and I'm spending way too much money on food. I've tried meal prepping on the weekends, but I often find myself not wanting to eat what I've prepared or I just don't have the energy to cook after a long day. \n\nI'm looking for any advice or tips on how to break this cycle. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you manage to change your eating habits? Any suggestions for quick, healthy meals that I can prepare in advance? Or any strategies for resisting the temptation of take out and late-night snacking? \n\nI appreciate any help or advice you can give. Thanks in advance!",
    "It was a decade ago, back in 2010 when I was a dumb, adventurous and invincible 20-year old. I had a penchant for psychedelics and one sunny afternoon found myself in possession of some good-quality acid. So, naturally, I decided to drop a tab and head over to the local park to enjoy the trip and experience the beauty of nature enhanced by the hallucinogen.\n\nSo, there I was lying on the grass, the trees above dancing and swirling, the sky turning a kaleidoscope of hues, and I was lost in my own little world. That's when a football spiraled through the air and landed beside me. I remember following its trajectory with childlike fascination. The kids playing nearby approached and asked if I could throw the ball back. My judgement and motor skills were questionable at that moment, but I agreed.\n\nI picked up the ball and in my altered state of reality, missed the field by a good mile, and sent it straight through the windshield of a parked police cruiser. The sound of shattering glass brought me back to reality and I witnessed the uniformed officer emerging from a convenience store, staring at his demolished windshield.\n\nI freaked out, to say the least, and irrational fear kicked in. The thought of explaining the situation to a police officer while tripping on acid was too daunting, so I did the only thing that seemed logical in the moment - I ran.\n\nTo my acid-drenched brain, it felt like I was outpacing a leopard but in reality, I must have looked like a drunk squirrel. I spent a good hour hiding, ducking and dashing through the town, till I finally reached the safety of my apartment. Heart still pounding, I peered from my window expecting to see squad cars and search lights, but all was calm outside. I spent the rest of the trip in terror, plagued by paranoia.\n\nObviously, running from the scene was an incredibly stupid and potentially dangerous decision. I was fortunate enough to not encounter the police again or cause harm to myself or others in my frantic state. In hindsight, I realize that tripping in a public place without a sober friend to guide me was a bad idea, a lesson learnt the hard way. \n\nStay safe and responsible out there, folks. Psychedelics can be fun, but knowing your limits and understanding the implications of your decisions while under the influence is crucial.",

However, I'm feeling incredibly disheartened and discouraged about my future prospects. \n\nI've always had the goal of becoming an RN (Registered Nurse) and I thought that becoming an LVN would be a stepping stone towards that. But now, I'm not so sure. I've been hearing a lot of discouraging things about the job market for RNs, and I'm worried that even if I do manage to get my RN license, I won't be able to find a job. \n\nI've also been struggling with the coursework and the clinicals. I'm passing, but just barely, and I'm worried that I won't be able to handle the increased workload and responsibility of being an RN. \n\nI'm feeling really lost and unsure about my future. I've invested so much time, money, and effort into this career path, and now I'm not sure if it's the right one for me. \n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation?

    "I know we're all strangers here, but I needed to reach out to someone, anyone who'd listen. Right now, I'm experiencing a level of loneliness and sadness I've never felt before.\n\nEverything in my life has taken a sharp turn for the worse. I've lost my job – it was a job I loved, a job I was good at. I had formed tight bonds with my coworkers and losing that place in my life has been a massive blow. As if that's not bad enough, my partner of five years left and took our puppy with them. It’s like she just flipped the switch. \n\nThey were my rock, my safety net, with their persistent optimism and their infectious laughter. We had a puppy together, who was the source of so much joy and comfort in our lives. The apartment feels emptier than ever now, echoing with memories.\n\nI feel like a shell of who I used to be. I barely recognize the haggard face in the mirror. I've been trying to keep going, but every step forward seems to push me two steps back. Logic tells me tomorrow will be better, but emotionally, I'm finding it hard to see anything past this murky haze of sorrow.\n\nAlso, in the midst of a pandemic, it feels much harder to reach out physically to my friends or family. And, to be honest, admitting this level of sadness to them only seems to deepen the wound. \n\nI'm not sure what I'm hoping to achieve by spilling my heart here. Maybe I just want to not feel so alone in my pain. Maybe I want affirmation that I'm allowed to feel this way, that it's okay to not be okay. \n\nI've read so many stories here, seen the compassion shown by strangers to each other, and I guess I'm hoping for a piece of that myself. If you've come this far in reading my vent, thanks for taking the time. I don't expect solutions. I just needed someone to hear me. Maybe this is the first step towards healing. Maybe tomorrow will be brighter. Thanks for listening, everyone.",
    "Last night while I was in my backyard, I heard this weird sound which sounded eerily similar to human laughter. It only lasted for a few seconds, long enough to pique my curiosity. It wasn't a bird or other animal; it was too structured, almost rhythmic. I suspect it might have been an insect. My initial guess was a cicada or a cricket, but after looking up their sounds online, neither were a match.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this? Is there an insect known to make such sounds or am I just imagining things? I am located in South Carolina, USA, if that narrows down possible insect types. I have to admit, it was a bit creepy, sitting in the quiet evening only to hear what sounded like tiny laughter. I'd appreciate any insight on this. Thanks in advance!",
    "Hello friends,\n\nI hope this post finds everyone well. I am currently on day 6 of not taking opioids, a feat I never thought I would have the strength to do. The past few years have been a whirlwind of spiraling addiction and destructive behaviors and it was about time I held myself accountable. Today, as I sit here writing this post, I can see the light at the end of this long, arduous tunnel. \n\nThe withdrawal symptoms kicked in on the second day. I experienced cold sweats, uncontrollable shaking, intense body aches, anxiety, insomnia, and several other frightening symptoms. The third and fourth days were much more challenging, with incessant vomiting and an intense craving for the drug I was weaning myself off. \n\nDay 5 was a blur. The physical symptoms seemed to lessen, but the mental toll was far from over. I found myself uncontrollably sobbing at times, feeling waves of guilt and regret for the path I had let myself go down. \n\nToday, day 6, I still feel an overwhelming urge to give in, to let this addiction take me back. But somewhere in me, a tiny voice says to keep pushing forward. I owe this to myself and I owe it to the people who love and believe in me.\n\nTelling my story out loud (or rather, writing it for strangers to read) is not easy, but I believe that being open about our struggles is the first step towards overall healing and recovery. I want anyone else out there who is dealing with an addiction to know that you're not alone. Know that there's strength within you, even if you can't see it yet. Comment below if you need support or are also on this difficult journey. \n\nI will provide an update at the milestone of day 7. I don't promise it will get any easier, but with each day I feel a small victory in my fight against addiction. \n\nStay strong everyone.\n",
    "So, here's my story. I'm just an average person, living an average life. No significant achievements, no groundbreaking accomplishments. I live in a small town, working a regular 9 to 5 job. I have family and friends, but no thrilling travel experiences, no cool hobbies. I'm pretty much invisible on social media, with barely any followers or likes, apart from a close-knit group.\n\nSome days, it stings, seeing people my age making it big, living the life I've only dreamt of. Other days, I'm content with my little bubble.\n\nBut lately, I've been feeling lost, as if I'm stuck in this void of nothingness. It's as if my identity and place in this universe have become insignificant. It's kind of scary, feeling like 'nobody', as if I don't make a difference in the grand scheme of things.\n\nBut then, isn't this what freedom is, in some twisted way? Having no identity or societal norm to live up to, no preconceived notions or hasty judgements, just me, in my raw form devoid of any labels. \n\nIs there anyone else out there who feels the same way? Can we cultivate this as our strength and just live our lives being 'nobodies'? Just throwing this out there to see if anyone else can resonate with these feelings. Any advice, thoughts, or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Let's have a conversation, shall we?\n\nBeing 'nobody' can sometimes be liberating, but more often than not, it's just... lonely. Is the loneliness worth the freedom? \n\nMaybe being 'nobody' is okay, or maybe it's not. I'm just trying to figure it out. Thanks for reading, fellow redditors.",

I am currently a Mormon myself and after years of introspection, I have recently come to terms with my own gender identity - realizing that I am transgender. \n\nThis inner understanding, although liberating, has also brought forth numerous questions and anxieties surrounding how my faith fits into this aspect of my identity.

    "I've been a loyal fan of this TV show for the past three seasons. I've invested so much time and emotion into the characters and the storyline. But this current season is just... disappointing.

    "I've been thinking a lot about the state of financial literacy among young people and I've come to the conclusion that we, as a society, are failing to equip our youth with the necessary tools to manage their finances effectively. \n\nFrom my own experience, I was never taught about budgeting, taxes, loans, credit scores, or investments during my school years. It was only after I graduated and started working that I had to learn all these things on my own. And let me tell you, it was a steep learning curve. \n\nI believe that financial education should start early on, ideally in high school or even middle school. This is the time when young people start to have their own money, whether it's from part-time jobs or allowances. It's the perfect opportunity to teach them about saving, budgeting, and making wise spending decisions. \n\nMoreover, understanding loans and credit scores is crucial for young adults who are considering going to college. They should be aware of the potential debt they could be taking on and how it could affect their lives post-graduation. \n\nInvesting is another topic that should be introduced early on. With the power of compound interest, starting to invest at a young age can make a significant difference in one's financial future. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that financial education is just as important as any other subject taught in schools. It's a life skill that everyone needs, regardless of their career path. By teaching our youth about money management, we can set them up for a more secure and prosperous future.",
    "As a teacher, I often find myself interacting with children on the autism spectrum in my classroom. Over the years, I've developed a few techniques to communicate effectively with them. Typically, I make sure to use easy-to-understand, simple and concise language and provide them with ample time to process and respond. I use visual aids whenever possible and I ensure a calm and soothing environment that doesn't overstimulate them. I try to alert them about changes in the routine beforehand. \n\nHowever, when I ask questions to autistic children, they sometimes get perplexed and don't respond. Other times, they might respond but not in the way I expected, at times due to misunderstanding the questions or sometimes because they approach the question from a different perspective.\n\nOne technique I've found successful is to give them choices instead of asking open-ended questions. For example, instead of asking \"What do you want to do?\", I ask \"Do you want to draw or read a book?\"\n\nI was wondering if there is a better way to do this? Is there anything else I should keep in mind when asking questions to children on the autism spectrum to yield better responses? I'd love to hear from any autism specialists, parents of children with autism, or individuals on the spectrum. This is a learning process and your insights would be very valuable.",
    "I've been playing XCOM's Long War Mod 2 for quite some time now, but I've recently hit a wall in my progress.

    "I've been gaming for a good chunk of my life, and I've noticed a trend in my preferences over the years. I used to love single-player games, getting lost in the story, the world, and the characters. But lately, I've found myself gravitating more and more towards multiplayer games.\n\nI've tried to go back to single-player games several times, but I just can't seem to get into them anymore.

The thrill of competing against or cooperating with real people is just something that AI can't replicate.\n\nI've tried to figure out why this is. Maybe it's because I've grown older and my tastes have changed. Maybe it's because I've become more social and crave interaction. Or maybe it's because the quality of single-player games has declined over the years. I'm not sure.\n\nI'm curious to know if anyone else feels the same way. Do you find single-player games boring and prefer multiplayer ones? Or do you still enjoy single-player games? What are your thoughts on this?",

It takes up only 2x2 squares in your inventory and can hold up to 12 objects inside of it, with each object taking up 1x1 square. The cube is used to combine items to create new items and can only be found in the Harem Level 2 in act two.\n\nNow, here's how to use the recipe:\n\n* 3 Perfect Skulls: You can mainly acquire skulls through killing monsters or through gem shrines when your character has no regular gems in his/her inventory.\n* 1 Rare Item: Just find a rare item that you don't mind either losing or modifying. Because the recipe creates a new random roll of the item, you won’t be able to predict the new modifier.\n* Stone of Jordan: Rare and valuable, the Stone of Jordan ring can be found as a drop from any monsters starting at level 26. It can also be traded from other players. \n\nOnce you have all the ingredients, simply load them into the Horadric Cube and manually activate the transmute power. The result will be giving the rare item new properties, which might turn out even better than the previous ones.\n\nRemember, with every craft, there's a level of RNG involved. You may not always get the stats that you desire. Therefore, think through before using this recipe, specifically because the Stone of Jordan is quite rare.\n\nHope this post adds a bit to your Diablo II experience. If any of you seasoned veterans out there have additional tips or tricks about item combinations in the Horadric Cube, please feel free to share! Happy gaming!",
    "After hours of research, gameplay, and comparative analysis, I am convinced that Turters--yes, this adorable little Shieldbug Sovereign--is the strongest character in the Xenoblade universe, even though initially this might seem like a trivial or laughable assertion.\n\nFirstly, let's not ignore the fact that Turters actually carries Zeke and absorbs most of his attacks. Even though Zeke is known for his brute strength, Turters ends up taking a significant amount of damage for him. Despite that, it never shows any sign of fatigue or damage, which possibly suggests immense resilience and absorbing abilities.\n\nSecondly, Turters' hidden strength lies within his tortoise-like shell. His shell is described in the game as \"harder than any human-made material\". It may not exhibit flamboyant combat skills, but its impenetrable defense mechanism is something that is hard to overlook.\n\nThe third point of consideration is Turters' mental strength, loyalty, and reliability. It does not matter how dire the situation gets or how strong the enemy is, it will always stick along with Zeke showing unwavering allegiance. This psychological strength cannot be understated, as it is often these attributes, rather than physical strength alone, that determines the outcome of a battle.\n\nHowever, the most persuasive evidence comes in the form of the Turters summoning method. Turters, in a very low-key fashion, really controls Zeke. He maintains the ability to summon a \"Blade\", which suggests a power level typically only found among Drivers.\n\nIn conclusion, Turters, with its high durability, psychological resilience, and hidden control over one of the core characters, is unmistakably the strongest character in the Xenoblade series. Underrated for sure, but not to be underestimated!",
    "Hey Reddit,\n\nI'm writing this post from a public library computer with desperation worming its way into my gut. I never thought I'd find myself in this position and I'm struggling to make sense of what's just happened. After an unfortunate string of bad luck, I now find myself jobless, carless, and essentially homeless.\n\nIt all started when I was laid off from my job. It wasn't even related to the pandemic, the company I was working for just went under out of the blue. I burned through my savings while searching for a new job but months of relentless applications and interviews led to nothing. My car, the last lifeline I had left, gave up the ghost amidst all this, and it's far too expensive to repair on my non-existent income. \n\nMy home - the place I'd been renting for the past couple of years - wasn't mine anymore as soon as I couldn't afford the rent. My landlord evicted me, and not having any local family or friends to fall back on, I'm left with no place to go.\n\nI've tried reaching out to local homeless shelters, but most are full or have incredibly long waiting lists. I don't know the first thing about surviving on the streets, and quite frankly, I'm terrified. I'm currently applying for any social assistance that might be available, but the bureaucracy is slow and complicated. I've also been getting food from a local soup kitchen, which is keeping me alive but barely. \n\nAll this has happened so quickly, it's hard to process. I'm a hard worker, somebody who believed in the value of hard work and perseverance, and always thought I could make it. \n\nI'm not looking for handouts, but any help or advice would be highly appreciated. If anyone has experienced something similar or knows what steps I can take to survive and hopefully get back on my feet, I would be forever grateful. This feels like the hardest situation I've ever faced, but I'm hopeful that this post might help change my situation.\n\nThank you for reading.",
    "I've been in this weird relationship with a friend for quite some time now. We used to talk every day and share everything but lately, it's been different. I find myself always trying to initiate conversations, but responses from them have become rare and short. It's not necessarily that they're rude or completely ignoring me, but the lack of effort and engagement is pretty evident.\n\nI initially thought they might be going through a tough phase, dealing with personal matters or issues, and so refrained from questioning their behaviour. I wanted to be understanding and give them space. However, this has been going on for months now. \n\nOn the one hand, I want to check up on them because I still care about them and I worry they might be struggling with something in private. Perhaps they're just not that into me anymore, or maybe there really is something bothering them and they're afraid to open up.\n\nOn the other hand, it's tiring to always be the one reaching out and showing concern, and it's disheartening when that concern isn't reciprocated. I'm afraid that my behaviour might be viewed as clingy or overbearing.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is how I should handle this situation? I don't want to come off as insensitive or intrusive by ignoring their behavior, but I also don't want to be a doormat. \n\nLooking for some honest advice here, any input is appreciated!",
    "Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to share my experience with Nexplanon, with the hope of seeking some advice or getting to know if others also encountered similar situations. I got my Nexplanon implant about six months ago. At first, everything seemed fine, and I was happy with my decision. \n\nBut as weeks passed, I started noticing some mood swings. Some days I feel very low and depressed, while on other days my mood is totally normal. I even have sudden bouts of anger, followed by intense sadness, something totally uncharacteristic of me.\n\nInitially, I didn't link these mood fluctuations to Nexplanon, assuming it was just due to work stress or personal issues. But lately, these mood swings have been more frequent and intense. So, I started to research about it and found that hormonal birth control can indeed cause mood swings.\n\nI am not sure if what I'm experiencing is a common side effect or if it's extreme and something I should worry about. I can't help but wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience? Did your mood swings subside with time, or did you have to have the implant removed?\n\nI already have an appointment with my healthcare provider to discuss this, but I thought it might be helpful to hear about other people's experiences as well. Any advice or shared experiences would be much appreciated. Thank you!",
    "I've been a regular customer at Lowe's for years now, and I've always appreciated their wide selection and generally helpful staff. However, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been increasingly concerned about their lack of enforcement when it comes to wearing masks.\n\nI've been to several different Lowe's locations in the past few months, and at each one, I've noticed a significant number of customers walking around without masks. Even more concerning, I've seen employees not wearing masks or wearing them incorrectly (like under their nose or around their chin). \n\nI understand that it can be difficult to enforce these rules, especially when dealing with customers who may be resistant or even hostile to the idea. But the fact remains that we are in the middle of a global pandemic, and masks are one of the few tools we have to slow the spread of the virus. \n\nI've tried reaching out to Lowe's corporate about this issue, but I've yet to receive a response. I'm posting this here in the hopes that it might get some attention and prompt some action. I want to continue supporting Lowe's, but I also want to feel safe when I'm shopping there. \n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences? Any suggestions on how to address this?",
    "Can anyone help me reconcile my religious beliefs with the behavior of my narcissistic parents? I was raised in a Christian household where respect and obedience to parents were emphasized as a key part of our faith. However, my parents are narcissistic and very often overstep boundaries, making me feel oppressed and miserable.\n\nThey use religious phrases and scripture out-of-context to justify their behavior and bend the world into their worldview. They have constantly made me feel guilty and insufficient, always demanding unconditional respect and obedience which I feel is not in line with Christian teachings. I feel like they are misusing religion as a tool of manipulation and control rather than leading me toward love and kindness.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this type of situation and can share how they manage the cognitive dissonance it creates? How do you maintain your faith while dealing with parents who seem to skew it for their advantage? Any kind of advice or shared experience would be very much appreciated.\n",
    "So, a bit of a background about myself first - I'm 25 and have been working full-time for the past five years. I've decided to go back to school to pursue a degree in Computer Science, a field I'm passionate about. The opportunity to gain knowledge and enhance my skills excites me but at the same time, the thought of getting back to academics makes me nervous.\n\nI've been away from the academic scene for a good while and honestly, I'm not sure how good I'll be at things like studying for tests, managing assignments or even pulling all-nighters for projects.\n\nWith a full-time job, I was used to a certain routine. Now I'll be back to a flexible yet demanding student life. Balancing studies with a part-time job (which I'll probably need to manage my finances) is another thing I'm particularly worried about.\n\nI am also anxious about fitting in with my peers. As I would be a non-traditional student, most of my classmates would probably be younger than me. Not that age is an issue, but I can't shake off the fear.\n\nI know these are a lot of concerns but I really want to get over these insecurities. I am certain about my decision and just want some advice on how to handle this upcoming change in my life. \n\nAny tips on getting back into student mode, managing time efficiently, or advice in general would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!",
    "As an aspiring Mercy main in Overwatch, I've come across numerous situations where I used my Damage Boost on various teammates, but wasn’t certain it actually helped. I understand that generally, projectiles, hitscan bullets, and many ultimates can be boosted.

    "Hello everyone,\n\nI decided to take the big leap and transition completely to digital gaming. After years of collecting, I have now amassed an extensive collection of over 5000 games - a collection that I now plan on selling. Included in my collection are titles that cover a broad spectrum of genres from Action and Adventure to Indie and RPGs. I'm sure there will be something special here for every type of gamer out there.\n\nOn top of the variety, I've also got a range of games spanning different gaming eras. From vintage Atari classics all the way up to the latest PS5 and Xbox Series X releases - you name it, and there's a high chance I have it. There are even some rare and limited edition copies for the collectors amongst you.\n\nAll the games are in excellent condition, some are even unopened. Each one is stored safely and has been well maintained. However, since shifting to an all-digital platform is now my objective, it's time for these games to find a new home. \n\nI'm currently in the process of cataloging the entire collection, but if there are any titles or platforms you're particularly interested in, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm open to selling the collection as a whole or in parts, depending on interest.\n\nFor those who are serious about purchasing, I'll be happy to provide detailed photos and descriptions of any game you're keen on. Prices are negotiable and will be based on rarity, condition, and market value. \n\nI understand holding physical games may seem like a thing of the past with digital now being the norm, but there's something about having that tangible copy in your hand that still appeals to many gamers. And now, I'm hoping my collection can bring joy to more people who share this sentiment.\n\nPlease do reach out either on this thread or via PM if you're interested in purchasing or simply discussing the games I have! It would be a pleasure to talk more about my collection.",
    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI find myself in a bit of an existential quandary of late and thought this might be an ideal place to bring it up. I have been feeling this innate urge to improve myself and my life but I am struggling with a distinct lack of concrete reasons to do so, which makes it challenging to start the process.\n\nI'm healthy, financially secure, have a stable job, good relationships, and am blessed with everything one could ask for. I am content with life in general, and nothing is fundamentally wrong. Yet, there is a force within me that's pushing for change. Not out of dissatisfaction, but a curious itch. I feel like I should strive for more, learn new things, instigate personal growth, and perhaps make a greater impact in life. \n\nHowever, I have difficulty channeling this urge. Every time I attempt to make changes whether it be setting new fitness goals, investing further in my career, or exploring personal interests, I hit a wall of unrewarding questioning - 'Why should I do this? Is it necessary?'\n\nI'm torn between the comfort of staying in the familiar path of routine or leaping into this unknown adventure of betterment without a clear motive. It is as though I'm floating aimlessly in space, with the option to steer towards a nearby galaxy. Yet, I can't really answer, why?\n\nIs it normal? Is it rational? Is it part of a mid-life crisis? I would love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or advice. Also, if anyone has found themselves in a similar situation and traced a path successfully, how did you motivate yourself to take the plunge? \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this issue might seem trivial, but I appreciate you taking the time to read my inner turmoil and respond. I'm sure your perspectives would shed some light. \n\nThank you.",
    "So, I was just browsing normally when all of a sudden my PC abruptly shut down. I thought it might not be a big issue, maybe just a power surge. I waited for a little bit and tried to turn it back on but nothing happens. I checked the power supply, it's working fine and giving power to the PC. \n\nThe monitor is fine too, as it works flawlessly with my laptop.

    "Sorry, I just need to vent and get this off my chest. It feels like my father is two different people sometimes - there's this caring, supporting guy who's there when everything goes well, but the moment something goes wrong, he turns into this harsh, criticising, storm in a teacup. It's exhausting and I honestly despise it. \n\nOne minute we're laughing over a family joke and the next, he's blowing up over something insignificant. If I make any mistake, minor or not, he goes off on this tirade about responsibility, hard work, and how our generation is \"lazy and entitled\". He holds everyone to ridiculous standards, including himself, but it feels unbearable at times. I'm not even a teenager anymore, but every time he goes off, its like I'm 14 again and in trouble for coming home late. \n\nEveryone in our family is walking on eggshells, constantly trying to avoid setting him off. But it’s not possible to avoid it completely. And the worst part is after he calms down, he acts like nothing happened and expects everyone else to forget about his outbursts as well.\n\nI really needed to get it all out of my system, I'm tired of maintaining a fake smile with him.

    "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm fairly new to FL Studio, having just made the switch recently from Audacity. I was pretty familiar with Audacity and got to a place where I was happy with the sound quality and had developed a good workflow. Now that I've moved to FL, I've noticed that my audio tracks sound different - the beats seem slightly offbeat, and the overall sound is just generally more \"muffled\" and less sharp than I'm used to.\n\nI know this is software-specific and I'm likely missing some key settings or such, but has anyone else experienced this while transitioning from another DAW to FL Studio? Should I be trying to adjust the EQ or use certain plugins/settings?\n\nAny help or advice here would be greatly appreciated. I am eager to get comfortable with this new software and continue improving my mixes. Thanks in advance!",
    "Ever since I first became interested in investing, my eyes have been drawn to the high-risk, high-reward world of leveraged ETFs. This branch of financial instruments can greatly inflate both gains and losses, magnifying the underlying asset's daily price movements.\n\nRecently, my attention has been focused on semiconductor leveraged ETFs, such as the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares (SOXL) and the ProShares Ultra Semiconductors (USD). With such a high degree of volatility, I can't help but wonder about the potential opportunities - and risks - of investing in these ETFs.\n\nI've done research into the sector as a whole, particularly on how it's become increasingly relevant in today's digital age. Semiconductors are the lifeblood of modern electronics and have seen a major surge in demand due to the rise of A.I., servers, and cloud computing. They're practically embedded into every new technological development which makes me believe that this sector could see substantial growth in the coming years.\n\nHowever, the industry is also known for its cyclical nature and unpredictability. There are regularly fears of oversupply, which can cause prices to plummet, thereby heavily impacting leveraged ETFs. There's also the growing geopolitical tension between the U.S. and Asia, where a large number of semiconductor manufacturers are located, to consider.\n\nI'd love to know your thoughts on this topic. Do you think it's worth taking a plunge into semiconductor leveraged ETFs, or are the potential risks too high to justify the potential returns? How do you feel about the industry's future prospects? Your insights and experience are highly valued, and I look forward to hearing your perspectives.",
    "I've been seeing my therapist for about a year now and I can't even begin to express how much she has helped me. I was in a really dark place when I first started therapy. I was dealing with severe anxiety and depression, and I felt like I was drowning. I couldn't see a way out and I was scared.\n\nFrom the very first session, my therapist made me feel seen and heard. She didn't judge me or make me feel like my feelings were invalid. Instead, she helped me understand why I was feeling the way I was and gave me tools to cope with my anxiety and depression.\n\nOver the past year, I've made so much progress. I'm not completely \"cured\" and I still have bad days, but I'm in a much better place than I was a year ago. I've learned so much about myself and I've grown so much as a person. I've learned how to manage my anxiety and depression and I've learned how to take care of my mental health.\n\nI honestly don't know where I would be without my therapist. She has been a constant source of support and guidance and I am so grateful for her. I can't thank her enough for everything she has done for me. She has truly changed my life for the better.\n\nI just wanted to share this because I know there are a lot of people out there who are struggling and might be hesitant to seek help. I want you to know that it's okay to ask for help and that therapy can make a huge difference. Don't be afraid to reach out. You're not alone.",
    "Just wanted to share an incident where a pundit really butchered a name pronunciation, something I still cringe at when I remember it. \n\nA little while back, I was watching this live sports commentary. There was this pundit who introduced a Swedish footballer named 'Henrik Larsson'. For those who don't know, it's supposed to be pronounced as 'Hen-rik Lar-son' with 'Hen' rhyming with 'pen', and 'Larson' as in 'car-son'. But this pundit just couldn't land it. He introduced him as 'Henri-Kay' followed by 'Larcen' (like the word larceny). \n\nI don't know if he was just having an off day or he genuinely didn't know the correct pronunciation, but it was shocking to see such a basic error coming from a professional pundit. It's one thing if the names are extremely challenging, but this was a bit too much.\n\nHas something like this ever happened to you? Have you witnessed any pundit struggle with names so bad that it was almost funny? Curious to hear your experiences.",
    "So, I just had to share this because I'm still in shock about what happened. I went to a local restaurant for dinner tonight, a place I've been to many times before and always had a great experience. But tonight was a complete disaster.\n\nFirst, it took them 20 minutes to even acknowledge that I was there. I was seated at a table and then completely ignored. I had to flag down a waiter just to get a menu. Then, when I finally got to order, they got my order completely wrong. I ordered a vegetarian pasta, and they brought me a steak. When I pointed out the mistake, the waiter argued with me, insisting that I had ordered the steak.\n\nAfter they finally agreed to bring me the correct meal, I waited another 30 minutes. By this point, I was starving and just wanted to eat and leave. But when the food finally arrived, it was cold. Not just lukewarm, but actually cold. I couldn't believe it.\n\nI asked to speak to the manager, but was told they were too busy to speak to me. I was so frustrated and upset, I just left without eating anything. I've never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant before. I'm still in shock over how poorly I was treated. I definitely won't be going back there again. \n\nJust needed to vent about this.

    "Just wanted to express appreciation toward this community for the constant reminders to simply step back and reclaim control of my life when things seem overwhelming.\n\nOver the past few months, I have found myself lost in the chaos of life and work, almost on the verge of giving up. But the encouraging words and inspiring stories shared by you all on this platform have been incredibly uplifting. It might seem trivial to some, but reading posts about personal struggles and how individuals have embraced, fought, and overcame their battles has been instrumental in my own journey.\n\nLast night, I stumbled upon a thread where someone suggested, almost like a mantra, to just step back and take charge when everything seems to be slipping out of control. This hit me hard. I realized how precious my peace of mind is and how important it is to just take a pause, step back, and analyze things objectively rather than being emotionally driven.\n\nSo, I did. I stepped back. I am taking a break from things that were pulling me down and reassessing my priorities. I am regaining my perspective and learning to say 'NO.' Most importantly, I am realizing that it's okay to put myself first.\n\nI am writing this post not just to express my appreciation, but hoping that my testimony adds to our collective professional and personal growth and gives a gentle reminder for anyone who is struggling out there - It's okay to take a step back and take charge!\n\nThank you again for inspiring a complete stranger with your words. We're not alone in our struggles, and we all have the strength to take control back. Stay strong, everyone.",
    "I'll preface by saying I think I've had a breakthrough. It's taken me a long time to get to this point - several years of introspection, therapy, and deep, sometimes painful self-examination. But I think I've finally been able to piece together the puzzle of why my self-esteem. Is. The. Way. It. Is. \n\nI think it all starts with my early childhood. I was never really the favorite child in my family. My siblings always outshone me in every aspect, or at least that's what my perception was. They got the most attention while I, on the other hand, received minimal acknowledgement from my parents, and it was predominantly critical feedback rather than praise.\n\nAs a result, I gradually began associating my worth with achievement. I felt if I could do better, I would get the love and validation I craved, not realizing at the time that love shouldn't be conditional this way. This mentality became ingrained over the years, leading me to constantly seek external validation through achievements.\n\nIn my journey as an adult, I've faced more than my fair share of failures, and due to this being tied to my self-worth, my self-esteem gradually began to decline, culminating in a point where my failures felt like they defined me. It's so easy to forget the successes when you're drowning in your failures.\n\nI need to remember that my worth is not tied to my achievements. I need to forgive myself for mistakes and understand that it's normal to experience failure. It's a part of life we all experience. But realizing it and truly believing in it are two different things. It is going to take a while to untangle these deep-rooted beliefs and build healthier ones.\n\nI am also finally realizing how crucial self-love is and, for the first time in my life, I'm going to make it a priority to invest in myself. More positive affirmations, more self-care, and less internal self-destruction. It's a shared journey, and if anyone else here is on the same road, I'd love to hear your experiences too!\n\nTL;DR - Realized my self-esteem issues stemmed from associating worth with achievement and a lack of love as a child. Now learning to detach worth from achievements and investing in self-care & self-love.",

    "I've spent a lot of time pondering on spirituality, existence, and purpose lately, and I thought I'd share an epiphany I had a few days ago. Let me preface by saying that whether you are spiritual, a believer in God, a devotee of science, or an atheist, this post is just sharing an interesting perspective.\n\nOne of the quieter moments this past week, I found myself thinking about my own existence and how I fit into this universe. As I quieted my mind, I could visualize the interconnectedness between every particle of this existence. We are all made of the same stardust, the same atoms that make up the universe and every living thing within it.\n\nIn that deep state of meditation, I felt a presence, a warmth I can best describe as 'divine'. It wasn't necessarily a biblical God or a deity from any religion, but rather a universal energy that binds everything together. It was as if I could see the Creator, not in physical form, but in the sense of feeling this oneness that intricately binds all existence.\n\nThis idea goes beyond the spiritual realm. Consider the law of conservation of energy in physics - energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. If our very essence is energy and this energy is shared throughout the universe, then we are all just different forms of the same existence. The universal energy, for some, might be this 'Creator', the very essence of our being.\n\nRemembering this oneness brings a sense of peace. It helps us see ourselves in others, fostering empathy, respect, and love. It dissolves fear and ushers in acceptance, as we start to view our fellow beings not as 'others' but as extensions of ourselves.\n\nAs we become more aware of this oneness, we begin to live our lives with a sense of purpose and unity. It changes our perspective towards our environment, our relationships, and our own selves. We recognize that our actions, words, and thoughts ripple through this interconnected network, affecting the whole. \n\nIn a world often filled with disconnection and discord, remembering our shared essence, our oneness, could be the key to a deeper understanding, tolerance, and harmony. Perhaps, the more we see the 'Creator' in all things, the better we can respect and care for this world and each other. \n\nJust a thought I wanted to share. Let's discuss and share perspectives if this resonates with you.",

It feels as though every time I try to do something, anything, it ends up not going well or just not fulfilling me, making me think that all my attempts, all my efforts are in vain. \n\nEvery rejection letter, every failed idea, every unsuccessful trial, every setback has left me feeling like a bird attempting to fly with broken wings. The self-doubt creeps in, whispering that no matter how hard I try, it's all pointless. I'm at a stage where it feels like my contributions make no significant difference, that I am irrelevant.\n\nEven things I used to be passionate about feels like a chore. Friends and family say it's a phase, and I should 'get over it.' But it's just not that easy shaking off the feeling of being stuck in a never-ending pit of desperation.\n\nI understand that life isn't meant to be easier, but at this point, I'm not sure how to cope with this constant weight on my chest. Do any of you also feel like this sometimes? How do you combat these feelings? Any advice would be really appreciated. I'm just trying to climb out from this abyss of pointlessness.",
    "Hello everyone,\n\nI recently purchased the EltaMD UV Clear Tinted sunscreen after hearing so many good reviews about it. I have a few questions that I hope some of you might be able to help me with.\n\nFirstly, I'm curious about the consistency of the product. I've noticed that it's a bit thicker than other sunscreens I've used in the past. Is this normal? \n\nSecondly, I'm wondering about the tint. I have fair skin and I'm worried that the tint might be too dark for me. Has anyone with a similar skin tone used this product? How did it look on your skin?\n\nLastly, I'd like to know how well this product works under makeup. Does it cause any issues like pilling or does it blend well?\n\nI appreciate any advice or experiences you can share. Thanks in advance!",
    "I am currently in a situation where I have a lot of credit card debt due to unfortunate life circumstances and impulsive spending habits. I've finally decided that this can't continue and it's time to take control of my financial health. I'm considering taking a loan to consolidate my several different debts which come with varying interest rates and payment dates. \n\nHowever, I don't fully understand if it's a practical solution or if it will just perpetuate my cycle of debt by shifting it from one lender to another. I've been researching and some financial experts suggest that debt consolidation loans may be a smart strategy if used correctly, while others recommend repayment plans or credit counseling instead.\n\nWould anyone who has experienced a similar situation or has knowledge about loans and debt consolidation care to weigh in? What factors should I consider while determining whether to take up a debt consolidation loan? Is there a possibility of falling into a bigger debt trap if I go down this path? \n\nSpecifically, I'm wondering about the terms and conditions I should watch out for, how this might affect my credit score, and better alternatives if any. I appreciate any advice you can give. \n\nPlease understand, I've learned my lesson and I'm trying to improve. Constructive advice only, please. Thank you.",
    "Hey everyone,\n\nI wasn't sure if I should post this or not but I believe there might be some wonderful folks out there who have been through the same and could share their wisdom. I am 34 weeks along and have been diagnosed with preeclampsia.\n\nInitially, I noticed swelling in my hands and face, but considered it to be normal pregnancy stuff. However, the persistent headaches and high blood pressure readings during my routine checkups raised concerns. The doctor suspected preeclampsia and performed some lab tests. Unfortunately, the results confirmed it and I was admitted to the hospital for further management and monitoring.\n\nIt's been a whirl of emotions since then. The nurses and doctors have been reassuring, but the uncertainty is quite overwhelming. I am worrying about the health of my baby and how this could affect our journey. \n\nHas anyone else been through this? How did you manage? I could really use some advice, tips or even just comforting words at this moment. How can I best prepare mentally and emotionally for this situation? What can I expect in terms of medical interventions and the delivery process? \n\nIf you feel comfortable sharing your own experiences with preeclampsia, I would really appreciate. \n\nThank you so much in advance!",
    "I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about two years now. We're both in college and we've been doing long distance for the past few months due to our different study schedules. \n\nRecently, I've been spending a lot of time with a female friend from one of my classes. We study together, have lunch, and sometimes hang out on weekends. I've started to develop feelings for her, but I haven't acted on them. I haven't told my girlfriend about these feelings because I don't want to hurt her. \n\nI'm not sure if this is considered cheating or not. I haven't physically cheated, but I feel guilty for having these feelings for someone else. I'm really confused and don't know what to do. \n\nI'd appreciate any advice or perspective on this.

    "Hi everyone. I’m reaching out on this platform because I've been diagnosed with dyscalculia, a learning difficulty that impacts my ability to understand and work with figures and numbers, similar to how dyslexia might affect a person's ability to read and write. \n\nAlthough it's a relatively known disorder, a lot of people that I interact with are not so familiar with it. I experience difficulties in learning mathematical concepts, lack an intuitive grasp of what numbers mean, have poor spatial skills, and find it hard to deal with money and time.\n\nThis condition affects my daily life in various ways and I suspect there might be many others out there struggling quietly. Feel free to drop your questions about my experiences or anything else relating to dyscalculia. I am not an expert, but I can certainly share my personal experiences and perspective. \n\nRemember that no question is too simple or irrelevant! Ask Me Anything.",
    "I've been struggling with something lately and I thought this might be a good place to share and seek advice. I've noticed that I've been feeling a lot of anger towards people of my assigned gender. It's not something I'm proud of, and it's not something I want to feel. \n\nI was assigned male at birth, but I've always felt more comfortable identifying as female. I've been on hormone replacement therapy for a few months now and I'm starting to feel more at peace with myself. However, I've noticed that I've been feeling a lot of resentment towards cisgender men. \n\nI think part of it might be jealousy. I see them and I see a life that could have been easier for me if I had been comfortable in the body I was born in. I see them and I see a societal acceptance that I've had to fight for. \n\nAnother part of it might be anger. I'm angry at the societal expectations that were placed on me because of my assigned gender. I'm angry at the people who enforced those expectations. And I'm angry at myself for not realizing sooner that I didn't have to meet those expectations. \n\nI know that it's not fair to generalize all cisgender men based on my experiences. I know that not all of them are responsible for the societal expectations that made me feel so uncomfortable in my own skin. And I know that there are many cisgender men who are supportive of the transgender community. \n\nBut knowing all of this doesn't make the anger go away. \n\nI guess I'm just looking for advice on how to deal with these feelings. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you cope with it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.",
    "I've always been interested in game development and recently decided to take the plunge. I've been looking into different game engines and software, and I've come across this one that seems to have a lot of potential. However, I'm a complete beginner and I'm having a hard time finding any 2D tutorials for this particular software.\n\nI've tried searching on YouTube, Google, and even on the software's official website, but I'm not finding much. Most of the tutorials I've found are for 3D games, which I'm not quite ready to tackle yet. I want to start with 2D games to get a feel for the basics before moving on to more complex projects.\n\nSo, for those of you who have experience with this software, how steep is the learning curve for a beginner? Are there any resources you could recommend that might not be as well-known? I'm willing to put in the time and effort to learn, but I'm feeling a bit lost at the moment. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
    "Before you buy Aphelios, it's crucial to note a few things. Aphelios, also known as \"The Weapon Of The Faithful,\" is a high-skill champion in League of Legends. Unlike traditional champions that come with different abilities, Aphelios got five weapons he can cycle through. Each one has its own unique abilities and purposes in a match.\n\n1. **Calibrum, the Rifle**: This weapon grants extra attack range. Its ability allows Aphelios to mark an enemy, then auto-attack them from anywhere on the map.\n\n2. **Severum, the Scythe Pistol**: This lifesteal weapon has a healing ability as its primary effect. The R ability with Severum gives Aphelios an AoE damage and tremendous lifesteal.\n\n3. **Gravitum, the Cannon**: This provides utility as it has a slowing effect. When used with other weapons, it can give Aphelios a crowd control ability.\n\n4. **Infernum, the Flamethrower**: Infernum is a wave-clearing weapon. Its ability lets him set enemies on fire and deal AoE damage.\n\n5. **Crescendum, the Chakram**: Crescendum functions as a boomerang. The closer Aphelios is to an enemy, the faster he can throw it which increases his DPS.\n\nBesides, Aphelios is also quite mana-hungry, so an early Manaflow Band and Presence of Mind are beneficial depending upon the runes and build you choose. \n\nLastly, mastering Aphelios demands excellent situational awareness, decision-making skills, and mechanical expertise. Understanding when and how to use the vast combination of his weapons is key to effectively playing Aphelios. \n\nSo, before you buy Aphelios, evaluating his complex mechanics and steep learning curve is vital. If you enjoy champions with depth and versatility though, Aphelios might just be the right choice!",
    "I've been using Reddit for a while now and I've noticed that the engagement on my posts varies quite a bit. I've been trying to figure out if there's a specific time of day or week that's best for posting content to get the most engagement. \n\nI've read a few articles online that suggest posting during the weekdays, specifically on Monday and Thursday around 1 PM EST, as these are the times when most users are active. However, I've also read that it can depend on the subreddit you're posting in, as different communities may have different peak times.\n\nI wanted to get some opinions from the Reddit community itself. Have you noticed a specific time that works best for you? Do you think it varies depending on the subreddit? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!",
    "After mainly playing PvE for a while, I decided to dive into Crucible for a change of pace. However, I've become increasingly frustrated with the matchmaking system. Anyone else having the same issues?\n\nLet me start by saying I don't consider myself amazing at PvP - I'm average at best. But one thing I've noticed is that the majority of matches I play, I either get steamrolled by a full fireteam running top meta gear or I get paired with new light players that seem to have little to no understanding of how to play Crucible effectively.\n\nI would argue that the current state of matchmaking isn't balanced at all. For instance, there's literally no reasoning behind getting matched with or against full fireteams when I’m solo queuing. Then there's the 'skill-based' aspect which doesn't seem to take into account weapon loadout, light level, or overall player experience and instead matchmakes you with players based on some arbitrary win-loss record.\n\nFurthermore, the sudden switches from face roll games to near impossible games are quite frustrating and it feels like there is no middle ground. It seems like the system is designed to keep all players around a 50% win rate, which makes me question the real purpose of the matchmaking. Is it really about player skill or just an algorithm to manage this win rate?\n\nAll these experiences have left me feeling pretty frustrated and demotivated to keep going. If we could get a better matchmaking system that takes into account our skills as well as our gear or a separate playlist for solo queuers, it would greatly improve the Crucible experience. I know there's always room for improvement on my end as a player, but a more balanced matchmaking system would definitely encourage more enjoyable and fair gameplay. \n\nThese are just my thoughts, though. I'm interested to hear what anyone else thinks about this issue? Anyone find ways to make the most out of this less-than-perfect state of Crucible matchmaking?",
    "Hey everyone, I'm going through a bit of a rough patch and could really use some advice. \n\nAbout six months ago, I ended a relationship with a girl who I now realize was the best thing that ever happened to me. We were together for about two years and had our fair share of ups and downs, but overall, it was a beautiful relationship. I was the one who ended things, mainly due to some personal issues I was dealing with at the time. I thought I needed space to figure things out, but now I see that I made a huge mistake.\n\nI miss her every day. I miss her smile, her laugh, the way she used to look at me. I miss our late-night conversations and the comfort of having her by my side. I've tried to move on, but I can't. I've tried dating other people, but no one compares to her. \n\nI want to reach out to her and tell her how I feel, but I'm scared. I'm scared she's moved on, that she's happy without me. I'm scared she won't want to hear from me, or worse, that she'll reject me. \n\nI know I messed up, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make things right. But I don't know where to start. I don't know how to approach her, what to say, or how to show her that I've changed and that I'm ready to be the person she deserves.\n\nI'm here asking for your advice, your thoughts, your experiences. How do I go about this? How do I show her that I'm genuinely sorry and that I want her back in my life? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
    "It's been a while since the announcement of the upcoming debut of \"Floor Plan 2,\" the sequel to the wildly popular virtual reality (VR) puzzle game \"Floor Plan.\" I've been eagerly waiting for the release, regularly checking Steam and Oculus Store for updates. However, I haven't been able to find any solid information on its exact release date or location. I've trawled various gaming websites, scanned social media, and even checked the developer's website, all to no avail. \n\nCould anyone provide me with any sort of information? Are there any planned beta releases or demos on the horizon? Or is it hiding out in plain sight and I'm just missing it? I'd appreciate any updates anyone has. Thanks a lot!",
    "I've been questioning my sexuality for a little while now and I could really use some advice from others who may have experienced similar confusion. I was raised quite conservatively, so I always assumed I was straight. However, recently, I've been finding myself attracted to other women.\n\nI've read about compulsory heterosexuality (comphet) and part of me wonders if the small amount of attraction I feel towards men might actually be a product of societal pressures rather than my own genuine feelings. The idea of being with a man isn't entirely unappealing, but when I think of emotionally intimate and physical scenarios, it's always been easier for me to imagine them with women.\n\nAt the same time, I'm worried that I may be interpreting my close feelings of friendship or admiration for women as something more because of how I have grown more accepting of different sexualities. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or guidance they can offer? How can I differentiate between what might be comphet and what might be real romantic or sexual attraction? \n\nThank you so much in advance for your help. Your insights would be greatly appreciated in this confusing time.",
    "I've always been fascinated by the various ways in which people choose to live their lives. From minimalists to maximalists, from urban dwellers to those who live off the grid. It's apparent that lifestyle choices are highly personal and incredibly diverse, each reflecting a unique set of values, preferences, and experiences.\n\nOn the flip side, there are also \"afterlifestyle\" preferences - an idea that might sound strange, but stick with me. I am referring to beliefs and customs regarding what happens after we die, including preferences for burial, cremation, memorials, and spiritual beliefs about the afterlife. \n\nIn my case, I live a somewhat conventional life in the city but when it comes to afterlife, I find comfort in the idea of being cremated and having my ashes scattered in the ocean, a place that I find incredibly peaceful. \n\nSo I am curious, what are your current lifestyle preferences and how do they contrast or align with your afterlifestyle preferences? Do you think your views on life (and death) are shaped by cultural, personal, or other influences?\n\nI'm just curious to hear different perspectives and trigger a thought-provoking discussion. If you're comfortable, please share your thoughts!",
    "I'm not sure where to start, but I guess I'll just dive right in. I feel like I'm nobody right now. I'm not saying this out of self-pity or to seek attention, but it's just how I feel. I'm in my mid-20s, I have a job that I don't particularly enjoy, I don't have a significant other, and I don't have any real hobbies or passions. \n\nI wake up, go to work, come home, eat, sleep, and repeat. I don't feel like I'm making any significant impact on the world or even on the people around me. I feel like I'm just existing, not living. I'm not depressed, or at least I don't think I am. I'm just...empty. \n\nI don't have any real friends. I mean, I have coworkers that I talk to and occasionally hang out with, but I wouldn't consider them friends. I don't have anyone that I can really talk to about my feelings or my thoughts. I don't have anyone that I can share my life with. \n\nI don't have any goals or dreams. I don't know what I want to do with my life. I don't know what I'm passionate about. I don't know what makes me happy. I'm just going through the motions, day in and day out. \n\nI'm not looking for sympathy or advice. I just needed to get this off my chest. I needed to put my feelings into words. I needed to acknowledge that I'm feeling this way. I'm not sure what the next step is, but I guess acknowledging the problem is the first step towards solving it. \n\nThanks for reading.",
    "Ever since I acquired my house, I've been in love with its vintage charm. The real estate documents mentioned that it was built sometime between 1940 and 1960. This was an interesting period in terms of architectural trends, transitioning from the pre-war traditional styles to the mid-century modern.\n\nThe house bears the tell-tale signs of this era with a few small differences that make it quite unique. The detached garage, the overhanging eaves, and picture windows are characteristic of the mid-century modern style. However, it has a touch of the 1940s with its hardwood floors, fireplace, and the plaster walls.\n\nOver the years, I have attempted to maintain the authentic style while modernizing where appropriate. I've updated the appliances and added insulation, of course, but I've tried to preserve original aspects like the wood paneling and the built-in storage.\n\nIt's become a passion project for me, trying to discern exactly when it was built based on these architectural details. Does anyone have any tips to help date houses from these decades? Maybe some lesser-known trends or features to look out for? I also wouldn't mind hearing your own stories of vintage house ownership. \n\nI'd like to think of this post as a space where we can share and learn more about the intricacies of this fascinating period in architectural history. Here's to celebrating and preserving our homes from the past!",
    "I often browse through multiple threads and see the sentiment that VA panels are considerably inferior compared to their IPS and TN panel counterparts. This baffles me a bit, considering VA panels offer certain benefits that you can't find on other types. For instance, VA panels usually have higher contrast ratios and lesser IPS glow when compared to IPS monitors. \n\nBut I'm interested to know why there is such an overwhelming dislike for VA panels. Is it because of the slower response times that can cause ghosting? Or the color reproduction isn't as good as IPS? Or maybe it is the typically poor viewing angles? Perhaps the motion blur that happens more often in VAs?\n\nIf you have any technical expertise in this area or have personal experiences with VA panels, I would appreciate your input. Maybe we could dispel some common misconceptions, clarify certain specifications, or even uncover more reasons; all to ensure that we understand this technology better. \n\nThanks for your time and looking forward to some enlightening responses.",
    "Last night, we had a little argument, nothing major, just your usual couple's discrepancies. My wife made a statement that I am stubborn and set in my ways, sometimes to the point where it starts affecting our relationship. I brushed it off as heat of the moment rant, but that statement lingered in my mind all night.\n\nToday, reflecting upon my past actions and decisions, I started to wonder, is she right? Maybe I am too stuck in my ways. I mean, I certainly don't intend to be. I have always viewed myself as someone open to change, up for new experiences and adventures. But then again, sometimes it's easier to perceive ourselves in a light better than reality.\n\nThere have been moments when I've disregarded her opinions or suggestions, perhaps out of arrogance or a misguided belief that I knew better. While, in truth, she's proven right most of the time.\n\nThe subtle sighs she utters when I argue about something insignificant, her quiet patience when I struggle to admit that I was wrong, they all seem to point towards the bitter truth. Maybe I do have an ego issue. \n\nI'm posting this here, not to seek validation, but more appropriate and various views and suggestions. How can I go about this self-realization? How can I change, be more accepting, less stubborn, and improve myself as a partner?  Any words of wisdom would be appreciated. I realize that to grow as a person and as a partner, this trait of mine needs addressing, and that begins with admitting that my wife may be right about me after all.\n",
    "As difficult as it is for me to admit, I still harbor strong feelings for my ex-husband. Our divorce was finalized nearly three years ago, after a decade-long marriage. The split wasn't bitter, but rather a mutual decision based on our realization that we simply had grown apart. \n\nStill, there hasn't been a day where he hasn't crossed my mind. It seems like no matter how much time passes, I can't seem to let him go. I have done my best to move on, even dating a few times, but no one seems to compare to the man I once shared my life with. I misinterpret his courteousness as mixed signals, making me feel both hopeful and desperate simultaneously.\n\nI don't know if it's only the familiarity that makes me feel this way or maybe I'm just scared to start over. There's part of me that knows I should keep the past in the past and look forward to the future, yet there's another part of me that yearns for the comfort and love I once had with him.\n\nI've tried therapy, meditation, immersing myself in work and hobbies, and even taking long vacations alone. But when I wake up in the morning or when I lay down at night, I quietly wish he was there beside me. \n\nI guess I'm posting this to seek advice from those who've been in a similar situation. How did you cope up? How did you manage to stop the emotional tug-of-war? I'd really appreciate some thoughtful guidance. \n\nSo yes, at the end of it all, it's the hard admission that I'm still in love with my ex-husband. I never thought I would be in this place, but here I am. I just hope one day I have the strength to truly move on.",
    "I've been pondering this question for a while now, and I thought it would be interesting to bring it up for discussion here. It seems to me that from a very young age, girls are often taught about the sacrifices they will have to make for their families. This is seen in many aspects of our society, from the media we consume to the conversations we have at home.\n\nIn many cultures, girls are taught to prioritize the needs of others over their own. They are told that they will have to give up their dreams, ambitions, and even their personal happiness for the sake of their families. This is often presented as a noble and selfless act, but I can't help but wonder why this burden is placed so heavily on girls.\n\nWhy is it that we don't teach boys the same thing? Why is the narrative different for them? Why are they not taught to sacrifice their dreams and ambitions for their families in the same way that girls are?\n\nI'm not saying that sacrifice is inherently bad. In fact, I believe that sacrifice is a part of life and can be a beautiful thing when done out of love and not out of obligation. However, I do think it's problematic when we teach girls that their worth is tied to how much they can sacrifice for others.\n\nI believe that everyone, regardless of gender, should be taught about the importance of balance. Yes, sometimes we have to make sacrifices for the people we love, but we also have to take care of ourselves. We have to pursue our dreams and ambitions. We have to prioritize our own happiness.\n\nI'm interested to hear your thoughts on this. Why do you think we teach girls about sacrifice in this way? Do you think it's harmful or beneficial? How can we change this narrative?",

    "Hey everyone,\n\nAbout two years ago, I made the switch from smoking to vaping as a means to cut down on the horrible after-effects of cigarettes. I was doing pretty solid until I moved cities for work and lost my habitual visiting to the local vape shop, and eventually relapsed into smoking puny cigarettes.\n\nHowever, I've been feeling the ill-effects of smoking recently and have decided to switch back to vaping. The problem is that I feel rather lost this time around. I guess the technological advancements in the vaping world didn't slow down in my absence!\n\nWhen I left, I was using a standard SMOK vape pen. It was doing its job just fine, but I think I’d like to explore more sophisticated devices that offer a better experience.\n\nCan anyone suggest some good vaping devices for intermediate users? I've seen so many terms like sub-ohming and pod vape, I honestly have no idea where to start. Also, I’d appreciate some advice on how to select the right e-juices, specifically when it comes to nicotine levels and flavors that resemble tobacco.\n\nLastly, I am a tad concerned about reports I’ve heard about vaping-related lung diseases.

    "I've been playing Siege for a good number of years now and I've noticed a trend that's been bothering me. It seems like the quality of operators has been steadily declining over the past two years. \n\nLet's start with the mediocre ones. These are the operators that aren't necessarily bad, but they don't bring anything new or exciting to the table. They have abilities that are either too similar to existing operators or just not impactful enough to make a difference in the game. It feels like the developers are running out of ideas and just throwing in operators for the sake of keeping up with their release schedule.\n\nThen we have the garbage ops. These are the operators that are so poorly designed that they're practically useless in most situations. Their abilities are either too situational, too weak, or just flat out broken. It's frustrating to see these operators being released when there are so many existing operators that could use some balancing or reworking.\n\nI understand that it's not easy to come up with unique and balanced operators for a game like Siege. But I think the developers need to take a step back and focus on quality over quantity. I'd rather have one well-designed operator every few months than a bunch of mediocre or garbage ones every season.\n\nI'm curious to hear what the rest of the community thinks about this. Do you agree that the quality of operators has been declining? Or do you think I'm being too harsh? Let's have a discussion.",

    "I had a session with my therapist today and it was a bit more intense than usual. We've been working through my issues for a while now, but today, she suggested something that has left me feeling a bit shaken. She said that I might need hospitalization.\n\nI've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time now. I've been on medication, I've been doing therapy, I've been trying to take care of myself physically and mentally. But it seems like nothing is working. I've been feeling worse and worse, and my therapist thinks that it might be time for a more intensive intervention.\n\nShe explained that hospitalization could provide me with a safe environment where I could focus solely on my recovery. She said it could be a place where I could get the help I need, 24/7, without the distractions and triggers of my everyday life. \n\nI'm scared, to be honest. The thought of being hospitalized for my mental health is terrifying. I've always thought of it as a last resort, something that happens when you're at your absolute worst. But maybe I am at my worst? I don't know. \n\nI'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure if I'm ready for this. I'm not sure if it's the right decision. I'm not sure how to tell my family and friends. I'm not sure about anything right now.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for some advice, some reassurance, some stories from people who have been in my shoes. If you've been hospitalized for mental health issues, what was it like? Was it helpful? How did you make the decision to go? How did you deal with the fear and uncertainty?\n\nI'm feeling really lost right now, and any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.",
    "I've been a huge fan of K-pop for years now. I love everything about it - the music, the choreography, the fashion, the idols, and the whole culture surrounding it. I've been to concerts, fan meets, and have a collection of albums and merch. However, despite my love for K-pop, I've never really gotten into K-dramas.\n\nI've tried watching a few, but I just couldn't get into them. I find them too long and sometimes overly dramatic. I also find it hard to keep up with the subtitles while trying to understand the plot. I know that K-dramas are a big part of Korean culture and a lot of K-pop idols act in them, but I just can't seem to enjoy them the same way I enjoy K-pop.\n\nI feel like I'm missing out on a big part of the K-culture. Is it weird that I love K-pop but not K-dramas? Does anyone else feel the same way? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",
    "So, I had an interesting day today. I was tasked with delivering two air conditioning units from Menards to a customer's house. The units were pretty heavy, each weighing around 80 pounds. I had to use a dolly to move them from the store to my truck. \n\nThe drive to the customer's house was about 30 minutes away. I had to be extra careful while driving because I didn't want the units to shift around and get damaged. \n\nOnce I arrived at the customer's house, I had to carry each unit up a flight of stairs to the second floor. It was a bit of a struggle, but I managed to do it without any mishaps. \n\nThe customer was very appreciative and even offered me a cold drink, which was a nice gesture considering it was a hot day. \n\nOverall, it was a challenging but rewarding experience. I'm glad I was able to deliver the units safely and make the customer happy.",
    "Hey everyone, \n\nI've been feeling down for quite a while, and just needed a place to vent. It seems like I am being constantly bombarded with societal expectations that I just can't seem to meet. As a guy, the pressure to be strong, successful, and emotionally stable is unrelenting. I'm supposed to have a high-paying job, be in perfect physical shape, and never show any signs of weakness or vulnerability. The benchmarks seem impossible.\n\nI'm trying to make do with what I've got, and I've made considerable progress in many areas of my life, such as fitness and financial stability. However, it seems like no matter how hard I push myself, I always fall short of these societal standards that are hammered into me. I always feel that I am judged on these parameters and found lacking.\n\nDespite striving hard, I can't shake off the feeling of worthlessness. Every time I boot up social media, it's always the same. Pictures of successful men, ripped bodies, luxury cars, etc., and all I can do is compare myself to them and feel inadequate.\n\nI guess I'm writing this post because I feel lonely, discounted for not living up to these markers of success. I’m yearning for acceptance and worth, but somehow it keeps eluding me. I realize that these feelings stem from my own insecurity, but knowing that doesn't make them disappear.\n\nI appreciate anyone who took the time to read this. I suppose I'm curious about how others might be dealing with similar feelings. Running myself ragged trying to meet every societal pressure just isn't sustainable, and I'm coming to realize it's damaging my mental health. Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",
    "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been keeping a diary for a few years now and I've found it to be a great tool for self-reflection and personal growth. However, I've recently hit a bit of a roadblock. I find myself constantly asking, \"What do I do in my diary/notes?\" I feel like I'm stuck in a rut, writing about the same things over and over again.\n\nI usually jot down my thoughts, feelings, and experiences of the day. I also write about my dreams, goals, and plans for the future. But lately, it feels like I'm just going through the motions and not really getting anything meaningful out of it.\n\nI'm looking for some advice on how to make my diary entries more engaging and insightful.

How do you keep your diary fresh and interesting?\n\nI'm open to any and all suggestions. I really want to get back to enjoying my diary and using it as a tool for self-discovery.

    "I've been having some issues with my MacBook Pro 15” early 2011 model. It's been a reliable machine for years, but recently it's been acting up. When I try to boot it up, it only gets about halfway through the process before it suddenly shuts off. The screen goes black and it's completely unresponsive.\n\nThe only way I've found to get it to turn back on is by holding down the power button for a long time. This isn't a permanent solution though, as the same issue occurs the next time I try to boot it up. \n\nI've tried resetting the SMC and PRAM, but neither of these have resolved the issue. I've also tried booting in safe mode, but the same problem occurs. \n\nI'm not sure what else to try at this point. I'm hoping someone here might have some suggestions or has experienced a similar issue. I'd really like to avoid having to buy a new laptop if possible. \n\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide!",
    "I suffered a traumatic brain injury about a year ago due to a car accident. Since then, I've noticed that my memory isn't what it used to be. I have trouble remembering things that happened before the accident, and even some things that have happened since. I've also noticed that I have difficulty concentrating and sometimes I get confused easily. \n\nI've been working with a neurologist and a therapist, but progress has been slow. I'm just wondering if anyone else who has experienced a brain injury has had similar issues? Is this a normal part of the recovery process?

    "Quin69, a popular Twitch streamer, was in the middle of a heated gameplay session when his game suddenly crashed. As thousands of viewers watched, he voiced his frustration, but couldn't pinpoint why it happened. Theories floated around, including connectivity issues or software bugs. But the real culprit? A Windows update forced a system reboot.\n\nWhile Quin69 was deep into the game, his operating system had a pending Windows update. It automatically initiated its standard procedure: a restart. Now, here's where things went south. Quin69's update settings had been set for automatic updates without prompting the user, which is usually not a big deal, but it becomes one when controversially Windows decides to do it in the middle of a live game stream.\n\nIt's a relatable situation for many gamers and streamers. The episode serves as a reminder to keep track of your system's settings, especially if you're in the middle of a critical gaming session and Windows decides it's the perfect time for that hefty update.\n\nJust to clarify, this isn't an intended dig at Windows. Chances are, any other operating system would have done something similar. The idea is to take this moment as a lesson that it's better to manage your settings effectively to avoid any such unexpected, game-breaking moments.",
    "I'm usually not one to complain about fast food service, but my experience at my local McDonald's today was just too frustrating to ignore. I went in for a quick lunch, expecting the usual fast and efficient service, but was met with the complete opposite.\n\nFirstly, the employees seemed to be moving at a snail's pace. There was a long line of customers waiting to order, but the staff seemed to be in no hurry to serve us. They were chatting amongst themselves, seemingly oblivious to the growing line and the customers' growing impatience. \n\nWhen I finally got to the front of the line, I placed my order for a Big Mac meal with a Coke. The cashier seemed distracted and didn't repeat my order back to me, which should have been my first clue that something was amiss. \n\nAfter waiting for what felt like an eternity, I finally received my order. However, upon opening the bag, I found that they had given me a Filet-O-Fish meal with a Sprite instead. I went back to the counter to have my order corrected, but was met with an indifferent shrug from the cashier. She took back the incorrect order and said she would correct it, but it took another 15 minutes for me to get the right order.\n\nBy the time I finally got my correct order, my lunch break was almost over. I had to rush through my meal, which completely ruined the experience for me. \n\nI understand that everyone can have an off day, but this was just unacceptable. The lack of urgency and attention to detail from the employees was very disappointing. I hope this was just a one-off incident and not indicative of a decline in service at McDonald's.",
    "Hey Reddit community, \n\nSo, the thing is, I'm about to graduate college in a few months and honestly, there's a sense of anxiety building up. I'm majoring in Computer Science and although it's considered as an in-demand field, I still feel unprepared for what’s to come. I know I want to do something in my field, but I don’t have a clear picture of my next steps.\n\nI've done well in my classes, participated in a couple of internships, and have stayed active in extracurricular activities. However, the thought of the \"real world\" out there; getting a job, moving to a new city, being financially independent, it all seems a bit daunting. \n\nCan anyone relate or have been through something similar and can offer advice? \n\nFor those who have already graduated and moved on to work life: How did you transition from graduation to your careers? \n\nFor employers: What do you look for in fresh graduates, besides the academic excellence and internships?\n\nAny advice, suggestions, or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

    "I recently purchased an Ender 3 V2 and have been having a blast with it. However, I've run into a bit of an issue.

    "Writing this post brings me mixed feelings, as I love my job. I knew I wanted to be in the mental health profession from the time I was in high school, participating in psychology classes opened up a whole world of understanding for me that I felt could foster connection and healing for people who suffer from mental health issues.\n\nBut, the past few years as a mental health professional have been draining, not physically, but emotionally. The system is flawed. It seems more focused on getting people out of the door rather than actually helping them recover, and I find that the administration often interferes with treatment plans for the sake of profit.\n\nWhat's even harder for me is the constant rollercoaster of emotions that I deal with. Some days are filled with success stories, other days are full of heartbreak. One day, a patient tells me they have managed to go a week without self-harming, and the next day, another patient is admitted after a suicide attempt. It's hard to not bring these emotions home, to not let them affect my personal life.  \n\nI also find myself constantly faced with limited resources, excessive paperwork, and overloaded caseloads. I feel like I'm losing touch with why I got into this profession in the first place—to help people heal and live better, happier lives. I have begun to dread going into work, and I come home at the end of the day feeling exhausted and empty rather than fulfilled. \n\nIn addition, the regular exposure to trauma and suffering has pushed me to the edges of burnout. I feel like I'm absorbing my patients' pain, and it's becoming a burden that's too heavy for me to bear, causing vicarious trauma.\n\nWorking in this field necessitates constant emotional labor, but there's a lack of support and understanding for practitioners themselves. Sometimes it feels like we are expected to be machines, not humans.\n\nPlease do not misunderstand, I wholeheartedly love my patients, and being a part of their journey to better mental health is ennobling. However, in order to do any good for them, I need to take care of myself too. \n\nI suppose writing this is my attempt to find some solace or some advice from those who might have been or are in the same boat. How do you cope? Can we talk about self-care in an emotionally demanding job without sounding self-centered or unprofessional? After all, this is a hard job we're doing, and I believe it's okay to admit the struggle. So here I am, admitting mine.",
    "Every time I get behind the wheel, it feels like an insurmountable task. I am bombarded by racing thoughts, I start sweating profusely, my hands tremble, and I feel like I have to throw up. I have been driving for over five years now, but it seems like this anxiety has only been getting worse. \n\nAt times, it is manageable, but on certain days, it takes over to the detriment of my safety. It is not only freeways that scare me; even local streets get me anxious because I fear I'll make a mistake or be involved in a collision. Naturally, this impacts my ability to go about my daily life, to go to work, to socialize, and so on. \n\nThese symptoms feel very much like what I've read about driving phobia, but I'm not sure if that's what it is. I've spoken about this casually with friends and family, but they seem to dismiss it, saying stuff like \"Everyone gets nervous sometimes. You'll get over it.\"\n\nI would appreciate any advice on this front. If you've ever experienced something similar, how did you deal with it? What kind of steps can I take to cope with this? Should I seek professional help? \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated. Apologies for the long post. I am at my wit's end and I really don’t know how to handle this anymore. Thanks in advance!",

    "\"Ratatouille\" is an exquisite example of perfect storytelling, masterful animation, and palpable heart. With Pixar's legendary reputation for outstanding animated films, \"Ratatouille\" certainly fits the portfolio with its charming yet poignant narrative that appeals to all ages. The film follows the adventures of Remy, a rat, who has an exceptional sense of smell and taste for fine gourmet, which leads him to concoct dishes that mesmerize even the most hardened critics.\n\nThe narrative, set against the backdrop of the colorful and atmospheric city of Paris, is expertly spun, cleverly woven and beautifully told. The character development is remarkable; from Remy’s quest for acceptance and validation, Linguini's endearing clumsiness, to Anton Ego's transformation from stern food critic to an awestruck patron of Remy’s culinary genius.\n\nMoreover, the quality of animation is stellar in its visual renditions.

All these are beautifully nestled within a multitude of hilarious moments, heartwarming sentimentality, and the sheer joy of cooking that will have viewers, irrespective of their age, laughing, crying, and thinking in equal measure.\n\nIt is a narrative feat that through the lens of a rat's life, \"Ratatouille\" touches upon deep-rooted prejudices, societal labels, and preconceptions which is admirably daring for an animated film. Lastly, the film owes much of its charm to an outstanding voice cast who inject their respective parts with sincerity and brimming personality.\n\n\"Ratatouille\" is anything but a typical animated movie.

    "\"Shaun of the Dead\" is a brilliant blend of comedy and horror, a genre mashup that is both hilarious and terrifying. The film is a perfect showcase of Edgar Wright's unique directorial style, characterized by quick cuts, visual humor, and clever foreshadowing. \n\nSimon Pegg and Nick Frost deliver outstanding performances as Shaun and Ed, two ordinary blokes caught in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. Their chemistry is palpable, and their comedic timing is impeccable. The supporting cast, including Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, and Dylan Moran, also deliver strong performances, adding depth and humor to the story.\n\nThe script, co-written by Pegg and Wright, is sharp, witty, and full of memorable lines.

    "\"Lion\" is one of the most heart-wrenching and emotionally powerful films I've seen in recent years. With its captivating story, exceptional acting, and stunning cinematography, this film is a true cinematic gem.\n\nSaroo Brierley's extraordinary life story, based on his memoir, is narrated with an incredible emotional depth and sensitivity. Most of the credit goes to the potent screenplay by Luke Davies, who managed to combine the right amounts of drama, sentimentality, and suspense.\n\nDev Patel, bringing life to the adult Saroo, gives an outstanding performance, giving us an insight into a man torn apart by the loss of his family and the need for a sense of belonging. Sunny Pawar, as young Saroo, tugs at our heartstrings with his innocent charm and emotional vulnerability. Nicole Kidman and David Wenham, as the Australian couple who adopts Saroo, add something special to the film with their sincere and heartfelt performances.\n\nThe cinematography by Greig Fraser deserves special mention. The contrasting landscapes of Kolkata's disordered life and Tasmania's serene beauty were captured beautifully and aid the emotional journey of the film.\n\nDirector Garth Davis' storytelling skills are commendable. He humanely narrates the story without overdramatizing the scenes or pushing the sentimentality to a level where it feels inauthentic.

    "\"Caddyshack\" is a classic comedy that has stood the test of time. Released in 1980, this film is a hilarious blend of slapstick humor, memorable one-liners, and a cast of eccentric characters that are as endearing as they are funny. \n\nThe film is set in the snobbish world of golf, but it's far from a sports movie. Instead, it's a riotous comedy that uses the backdrop of a country club to poke fun at the pretentiousness of high society. The plot is loose and free-flowing, allowing for a series of comedic vignettes that are both absurd and entertaining.\n\nThe ensemble cast is a major highlight of \"Caddyshack\". Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, and Bill Murray all deliver standout performances, each bringing their unique comedic style to the film. Murray, in particular, is a scene-stealer as the bumbling groundskeeper Carl, whose war against a pesky gopher provides some of the film's most memorable moments.\n\n\"Caddyshack\" is also notable for its irreverent humor. The film is filled with jokes that are both clever and crude, and it's not afraid to push the boundaries of good taste. This might not appeal to everyone, but for those who appreciate this type of humor, \"Caddyshack\" is a comedic goldmine.\n\nThe film does have its flaws. The plot is thin and the pacing can be uneven. But these are minor quibbles in a film that is primarily about generating laughs. And on that front, \"Caddyshack\" delivers in spades.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Caddyshack\" is a comedy classic that is well worth watching. Its humor may be lowbrow, but its laughs are high quality. Whether you're a fan of golf, comedy, or just good old-fashioned fun, \"Caddyshack\" is a movie that is sure to entertain.",
    "\"Hustle & Flow\" is a gut-wrenching, hard-knocking journey into the beautifully gritty reality of the struggle of an aspiring hip-hop artist. It's an unconventional story that resonates far beyond the boundaries of the music industry, underscored by Terrence Howard's phenomenal performance.\n\nHoward gives life to Djay, a Memphis hustler with larger-than-life dreams which are threatened by the inescapable realities of his life. His nuanced portrayal charts an arc of transformation that is as compelling as it is unexpected. The supporting cast, particularly Taraji P. Henson and Anthony Anderson, add depth and authenticity to the narrative, contributing remarkable performances.\n\nDirector Craig Brewer's vision is stark and unflinching, yet tender. With Memphis as its fascinating backdrop, \"Hustle & Flow\" captures the bluesy, humid Southern setting with a palpable veracity. The cinematography is unfussy, gritty and serves the story beautifully. \n\nThen there's the music - it’s the pulsating heart of the film. Strongly written and impressively performed by Terrence Howard, the songs are as raw and authentic as the story. The Oscar-winning \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp\" is a furious, catchy embodiment of Djay's struggle and ambition. \n\n\"Hustle & Flow\" detangles itself from the clichés of most films within its genre by refusing to paint its characters as purely heroes or villains. Characters are deeply flawed but also deeply human. You feel their desperation, root for their dreams, and resonate with their aspirations. \n\nIn a nutshell, \"Hustle & Flow\" is an intense, gripping journey of dreams, redemption and the unfaltering human spirit armed with an unforgettable soundtrack. It’s not always an easy watch, but it’s a vital one that transitions smoothly between moments of despair and hope. A decidedly offbeat yet terrific film that surely warrants a watch.",
    "\"Sweet and Lowdown\" is an exquisite entry dialogue on the artistry, eccentricity, and intertwined complexity of music and life, presented through the keen and delightful lens of the acclaimed auteur, Woody Allen. In his homage to the jazz era, Allen introduces an incredibly complex character in the form of Emmet Ray (played by Sean Penn), a man who embodies both the brilliance of an artist and the self-destructive tendencies of a flawed human. \n\nReminiscent of his previous works, \"Sweet and Lowdown\" masterfully translates Allen's signature style of smart, witty, dark humor and profound existential discourse onto the film's 1930s canvas. The film cleverly blends fiction with authenticity through the inclusion of pseudo-documentary elements, which add a layer of compelling depth to the storyline.\n\nSean Penn’s standout performance as a brilliant, yet deeply flawed jazz guitarist is worth every accolade it's received and then some more. His portrayal of Emmet Ray seems almost effortless and his sheer talent does absolute justice to the complexities of the character, making him fascinatingly watchable despite his negative traits. Samantha Morton, with her virtually mute role as Hattie, showcases extraordinary acting restraint with her heart-wrenchingly genuine performance, communicated through her expressive eyes and body language.\n\nThe jazz-heavy soundtrack subtly yet persuasively anchors the film's emotional depth, enhancing our understanding of Ray's internal struggles. It is the sheer magic of music that conveys the core essence of the narrative, connecting us to Ray's world.\n\n\"Sweet and Lowdown\" explores love, ambition, regret, the fickleness of fame and the tormented soul of an artist with a raw sensitivity that will leave you both amused and introspective. If you're an ardent fan of Woody Allen's distinct narrative style, this film is an absolute must-watch. Most importantly, it is a glorious tribute to the timeless beauty and transformative power of music.",

It is a film that can be enjoyed by both children and adults, thanks to its clever humor, engaging storyline, and visually stunning animation.\n\nThe film's plot is surprisingly deep and thought-provoking, considering it is based on a children's toy. It explores themes of individuality, conformity, and the power of imagination, all wrapped up in a fast-paced adventure that never loses its momentum.

The characters they bring to life are well-developed and memorable, each with their own quirks and personalities. The dialogue is witty and often hilarious, filled with clever puns and references that will have adults chuckling and children laughing out loud.\n\nVisually, \"The Lego Movie\" is a feast for the eyes. The animation is incredibly detailed and vibrant, with each Lego piece looking realistic and tangible. The action sequences are well-choreographed and exciting, and the film's unique visual style sets it apart from other animated films.\n\nThe film also boasts a catchy soundtrack, with the song \"Everything is Awesome\" being a particular highlight. It's a tune that perfectly encapsulates the film's upbeat and positive vibe.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Lego Movie\" is a brilliantly crafted film that is both entertaining and meaningful.

    "\"Snowden\" is a compelling and thought-provoking biographical political thriller that delves into the life of Edward Snowden, the infamous NSA whistleblower. Directed by Oliver Stone, the film is a riveting exploration of the modern world's surveillance state and the moral dilemmas that come with it.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a stellar performance as Edward Snowden, capturing the essence of the man with a nuanced portrayal that is both sympathetic and challenging. His transformation from a patriotic soldier to a disillusioned whistleblower is portrayed with a depth and subtlety that keeps the audience engaged throughout.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Shailene Woodley, Zachary Quinto, and Melissa Leo, also deliver strong performances, adding layers to the narrative and enhancing the overall viewing experience. The on-screen chemistry between Gordon-Levitt and Woodley, who plays Snowden's girlfriend Lindsay Mills, is particularly noteworthy, adding a personal dimension to the political drama.\n\nThe film's pacing is well-executed, gradually building tension as Snowden's disillusionment grows and the stakes get higher. Stone's direction is commendable, balancing the technical aspects of the story with the human drama. The screenplay, co-written by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald, is intelligent and insightful, providing a balanced perspective on a controversial subject.\n\nThe cinematography and editing are top-notch, effectively conveying the paranoia and fear that come with living in a surveillance state. The film's score, composed by Craig Armstrong, complements the narrative perfectly, enhancing the suspense and emotional impact of key scenes.\n\n\"Snowden\" is not just a biopic, but a commentary on privacy, freedom, and the price one pays for truth. It's a film that will make you question, reflect, and perhaps even fear. It's a must-watch for anyone interested in contemporary politics, civil liberties, or simply a well-crafted cinematic experience.",
    "\"Deadpool 2\" is a riotous blend of action, comedy, and heart that manages to surpass its predecessor in almost every way. Ryan Reynolds once again dons the red suit and dual katanas as the titular anti-hero, delivering a performance that is as hilarious as it is emotionally resonant. His charisma and comedic timing are on full display, making every quip and fourth-wall break land with precision.\n\nThe plot is more complex and engaging this time around, with higher stakes and a more personal journey for our hero. The introduction of new characters, such as the time-traveling Cable (Josh Brolin) and the luck-altering Domino (Zazie Beetz), adds depth and variety to the narrative. Both Brolin and Beetz deliver strong performances, with Brolin's gruff seriousness providing a perfect foil to Reynolds' irreverent humor, and Beetz's Domino being a delightful addition to the mix.\n\nThe action sequences are bigger, bolder, and more creative, with director David Leitch's background in stunt work clearly evident. The film's R-rating is fully utilized, with the violence being both brutal and cartoonishly over-the-top, perfectly fitting the tone of the film.\n\nHowever, what truly sets \"Deadpool 2\" apart is its surprising emotional depth. Amidst all the jokes and action, there are moments of genuine heart and emotion that give the film a depth often lacking in other superhero movies. The exploration of themes such as loss, regret, and redemption adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, making the film as touching as it is entertaining.\n\nThe film is not without its flaws, of course. Some jokes don't land as well as others, and the pacing can be a bit uneven at times. However, these are minor quibbles in what is otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Deadpool 2\" is a fantastic sequel that manages to improve upon the original in almost every way. It's a hilarious, action-packed, and surprisingly heartfelt film that is sure to please both fans of the first film and newcomers alike.

    "\"Twilight\" is a film that has managed to capture the hearts of many, especially the younger audience, with its unique blend of romance, fantasy, and teenage angst. The movie, based on Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novel, introduces us to the world of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), a seemingly ordinary girl who moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, and falls in love with the mysterious Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), who happens to be a vampire.\n\nThe film's strength lies in its ability to portray the intensity of teenage love and the lengths one would go to protect their loved ones. The chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson is palpable, making their forbidden love story believable and engaging.

It delves into the human spirit, the struggle of a man against his demons, and the power of faith and perseverance. Will Smith as Bagger Vance delivers a stellar performance, bringing a mystical and enigmatic charm to his character.

The film's OST features some of Whitney's most iconic songs, with the hit single \"I Will Always Love You\" leaving an enduring mark on viewers.\n\nThere is a magnetic chemistry between Costner and Houston, one that convincingly evolves from professional and aloof to deeply intimate. The film places heavy emphasis on their emotional journey, exploring themes of love, sacrifice, and the delicate balance between personal and professional life. \n\nThe plot takes several unexpected turns and withholds enough information to keep the viewer intrigued.

There is depth of emotion frequently permeating scenes.

While the movie's humor may not cater to everyone, its slapstick elements, outlandish dialogue, and exaggerated performances result in a surprisingly enjoyable viewing experience for those willing to suspend some disbelief and soak in the silliness.\n\nThe table tennis scenes, extravagant in their over-the-top execution, give the movie a memorable and unique edge. Though some may criticize the film's lack of realism, it is clear the film relies on this hyperbolic perspective to comedic effect.\n\nDespite all its raucous hi-jinks, “Balls of Fury” has a certain irresistible charm. A hilariously fun film which never takes itself too seriously, it serves as a comically exaggerated homage to sports and martial arts movies. Its only regret might be that it didn’t push the absurdity even further – a truly ballsy move.\n\n\"Balls of Fury\" may not be a masterpiece of comedic high art, but it is a fun romp that ultimately succeeds at delivering laughs and lighthearted entertainment. While it certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea, those with a taste for quirky comedies may find it worth a watch.",

    "\"The Jungle Book\" is a cinematic masterpiece that beautifully blends live-action with stunning CGI effects, creating a visually captivating experience. The film is a retelling of Rudyard Kipling's classic tale, and it does justice to the original while adding its own unique flavor.\n\nThe story follows Mowgli, a young boy raised by wolves in the jungle, as he embarks on a thrilling journey of self-discovery. The narrative is engaging and filled with heartwarming moments, making it a perfect family film. The voice cast, including Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, and Idris Elba, breathes life into the beloved characters, with each actor perfectly embodying their respective roles.\n\nThe real star of the film, however, is the breathtaking animation. The jungle is rendered in exquisite detail, making it feel like a living, breathing entity. The animals are incredibly lifelike, and their interactions with Mowgli are seamless, making it easy to forget that they are not real.\n\nThe film also excels in its pacing, balancing quieter, character-driven moments with thrilling action sequences.

    "\"The Last Samurai\" is a beautifully woven tapestry of honor, tradition, courage and culture. Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise deliver performances imbued with power and nuance in this deep and often harsh exploration of two very different worlds colliding. \n\nCruise, in one of his most layered performances, plays alcoholic Civil War veteran Nathan Algren who is hired to help modernize the Japanese army, but finds himself drawn in by the honor and courage of the samurais he is tasked to destroy. Cruise's journey from self-loathing mercenary to adoring acolyte is extremely compelling, providing a fine anchor for the plot. Watanabe, however, is the real star of \"The Last Samurai\". His portrayal of Katsumoto, the titular last samurai, is both poignant and powerful, embodying the grace, wisdom, and serenity of an ancient warrior culture.\n\nThe movie is a visual spectacle - the raw majesty of the Japanese countryside becomes a character unto itself, standing in stark contrast to the industrial harshness of the burgeoning Meiji era. Director Edward Zwick brilliantly constructs fantastically kinetic battle sequences that viewers can almost feel in their bones. He does not shy away from the brutality of combat, but rather uses it to further emphasize the stark divide between the Samurai's honor-bound warfare and the impersonal steel and fire of modern weaponry.\n\n\"The Last Samurai\" also demonstrates an immense amount of respect for Japanese customs and traditions, particularly with the thoughtful depiction of the samurai culture. The portrayal feels authentic and truthful, offering a unique insight into a world not often explored in mainstream cinema.\n\nThe film, however, is not without its flaws. The pace can be slow at times and some plot developments are quite predictable. Also, the handling of the romantic subplot seems somewhat contrived and unconvincing.\n\nDespite this, \"The Last Samurai\" remains a compelling narrative about a clash of cultures and perspectives. It's part historical epic, part character study, and part philosophical musing. The performances, visuals and resonating themes ultimately make it a cinematic journey worth undertaking.",
    "\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is a heart-wrenching tale that explores the horrors of the Holocaust through the innocent eyes of a young boy. The film is a poignant reminder of the atrocities committed during World War II, and it does so with a delicate balance of sensitivity and brutal honesty.\n\nThe performances in this film are nothing short of extraordinary. Asa Butterfield, who plays the young German boy Bruno, delivers a performance that is both innocent and deeply moving. His friendship with Shmuel, a Jewish boy played by Jack Scanlon, is portrayed with such authenticity that it tugs at your heartstrings. The chemistry between the two young actors is palpable, making their bond all the more believable and touching.\n\nThe film's narrative is beautifully crafted, with a slow build-up that allows the audience to fully immerse themselves in the characters' lives. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the stark contrast between Bruno's privileged life and the grim reality of the concentration camp. The film's climax is a gut punch that leaves you reeling, a testament to the director's ability to evoke strong emotions.\n\nHowever, \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is not without its flaws. Some may argue that the film oversimplifies the complexities of the Holocaust, presenting it through a somewhat sanitized lens. While this criticism is valid, it's important to remember that the film is told from the perspective of a child, which naturally limits the scope of the narrative.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is a powerful film that serves as a stark reminder of one of history's darkest periods. It's a film that will make you think, make you cry, and most importantly, make you remember. It's a film that should be seen by everyone, not just as a history lesson, but as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.",
    "\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", the fifth instalment in the Harry Potter Series, truly holds its ground and carries forward the legacy of the globally acclaimed franchise. Director David Yates has managed to deliver a visually stunning piece, filled with an assortment of emotions, ranging from elation to a deep sense of loss. \n\nIn terms of acting, the young ensemble once again shines with a notable increase in the depth of their performances. Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry Potter, brilliantly displays his character's maturing, showing signs of the weary hero facing increasing burdens. Furthermore, Imelda Staunton's Dolores Umbridge stands out as an impactful antagonist, ingrained in our memories with her zeal for wickedness concealed under a façade of polished politeness. \n\nThe special effects in \"Order of the Phoenix\" are enchanting, staying true to the fantasy genre with its magnificent CGI. From the Thestrals to the riveting wizard duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, the visual effects add significantly to the magic and grandeur of the film. \n\nThe narrative gets darker, reflecting the rising threats and emotional turmoil faced by our lead characters. The script beautifully intertwines the central theme about the importance of hopeful defiance in the face of impending doom. The battles are not just with external forces, but also within, and this film does justice in portraying that struggle.\n\nIf there is one critique to be made, it would be that the movie often rushes through important plot points, perhaps due to the constraint of fitting a large amount of content from J.K. Rowling's fifth book into a two hour film. That being said, the essence of the story is not lost and freshness is maintained despite being a part of a long series.\n\nBeyond its grandeur and impeccable performances, the film stands tall as a piece of art that brings about the right emotions at the right time, giving one a rich, satisfying cinematic experience. It symbolises the bravery and resilience of adolescents faced with a changing world. A truly engaging watch for audiences of all ages, this movie is a wonderful blend of magic, conflict, friendships, and a subtle reminder of the inevitability of growing up.",
    "\"Semi-Pro\" is one of those films that you simply can't judge too harshly because it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is- a no-holds-barred, all-out comedy! The Will Ferrell factor is undoubtedly the driving force behind the film's humorous appeal. Ferrell's comedic timing is impeccable as he fully embraces the irreverent, absurd persona of Jackie Moon, who owns, coaches, and plays for his American Basketball Association team.\n\nThe film mirrors the mid-70s setting, colorfully incorporating gaudy suits, exaggerated hairdos, funky music, and goofy dance routines that only add to the humor. But what's really entertaining about \"Semi-Pro\" is its ensemble cast. Woody Harrelson, as Monix, delivers a stand-out performance with his character's unique blend of cynicism and determination. Andre Benjamin (Outkast's Andre 3000) as 'Coffee' Black, adds a refreshing layer of genuine basketball talent and comedic proximity. Together with Ferrell, they create a dynamic trio with a laugh-a-minute rapport.\n\nOne must admit the storyline feels disjointed at times, and not all jokes land with precision. But director Kent Alterman uses the 70s aesthetic and the sheer absurdity of the premise to maintain an entertaining atmosphere. You'll find the humor is less situated in the narrative and more embedded in the eclectic characters, ludicrous situations, and witty dialogue, meaning there's always something to tickle the funny bone.\n\nWhile \"Semi-Pro\" might not be a cinematic masterpiece by traditional standards, it's definitely a proficient comedy within its genre. Viewers looking for a light-hearted romp with a good dose of nostalgic 70's charm, ridiculous antics, and hilariously inappropriate humor should look no further as this film delivers on all fronts.\n\nRemember, it's not a film to be deeply analyzed or critically evaluated but to sit back and enjoy for its unashamedly funny, sometimes silly, but always entertaining content.\"",
    "\"Ocean's Eleven\" is a cinematic masterpiece that effortlessly combines elements of comedy, action, and suspense into a thrilling heist film. The movie, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name, but it stands on its own as a modern classic.\n\nThe film's plot is intricate and engaging, revolving around a group of eleven skilled criminals, led by the charismatic Danny Ocean (George Clooney), who plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously. The heist itself is a marvel of storytelling, with each step of the plan revealed in a way that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe ensemble cast is one of the film's greatest strengths. Clooney's performance as Ocean is charming and suave, while Brad Pitt, as his right-hand man Rusty Ryan, provides a cool, laid-back counterpoint. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, and their witty banter is a highlight of the film. The supporting cast, including Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and Julia Roberts, also deliver strong performances, each bringing their unique talents to their respective roles.\n\nThe film's pacing is excellent, with the tension steadily building up to the climactic heist. The cinematography is stylish and slick, capturing the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of jazz, swing, and funk, perfectly complements the film's cool, sophisticated vibe.\n\n\"Ocean's Eleven\" is not just a heist film; it's a study in character dynamics, a comedy, and a visual spectacle.

    "\"District 9\" is a groundbreaking film that seamlessly blends science fiction and social commentary, creating a unique cinematic experience that is both thought-provoking and entertaining. Directed by Neill Blomkamp and produced by Peter Jackson, the film is set in an alternate reality where an alien ship has been stranded above Johannesburg, South Africa, and its inhabitants have been forced to live in a government-controlled slum known as District 9.\n\nThe film's narrative is presented in a pseudo-documentary style, which adds a layer of realism to the fantastical elements of the story. This innovative storytelling technique, combined with the film's gritty visual aesthetic, creates a sense of immersion that is rarely seen in science fiction cinema.\n\nThe protagonist, Wikus van de Merwe, played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley, is a bureaucrat tasked with relocating the alien population. His character arc is both compelling and tragic, as he transforms from an unlikable government stooge to a sympathetic figure fighting for survival and redemption.\n\n\"District 9\" is not just a thrilling sci-fi action film, but also a poignant allegory for apartheid and the broader issues of xenophobia and segregation. The film's depiction of the aliens, or \"prawns\" as they are derogatorily referred to, is a powerful metaphor for the dehumanization and marginalization of minority groups.\n\nThe special effects in \"District 9\" are top-notch, with the alien technology and the prawns themselves being particularly impressive. The action sequences are intense and well-choreographed, with a level of violence that underscores the brutal reality of the film's setting.\n\nIn conclusion, \"District 9\" is a remarkable film that pushes the boundaries of the science fiction genre. It is a testament to the power of cinema to not only entertain, but also to challenge and provoke thought. This film is a must-see for any fan of intelligent, socially conscious science fiction.",
    "\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\" is an amalgam of action, romance, and fantasy all set in the mystical lands of Persia - a concept that triggers excitement. It's a piece adapted from a classic video game, and it definitely fits well into the mold for an entertaining blockbuster hit with its breathtaking visual effects and gripping storyline.\n\nJake Gyllenhall, as Prince Dastan, did a commendable job translating the video game character to the full screen. He delivers a powerful performance with charming wit, adventurous spirit, and physical agility. Gemma Arterton, playing the role of Princess Tamina, is equally mesmerizing with her captivating beauty and strong character.\n\nThe special effects and stunts were spectacular and definitely one of the movie's strongest points. There are plenty of swashbuckling scenes that keep audiences on the edge of their seats. Also, the set design was visually stunning and successfully captured the grandiosity of the era with its monumental architecture and vivid landscapes.\n\nDespite these positives, the film does have its flaws. The plot, at times, felt rushed and lacked depth. Certain elements within the storyline seemed convoluted and underdeveloped, causing some scenes to lose their impact. Furthermore, the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Arterton, although evident, needed a bit more spark to really light up their romantic subplot.\n\nBut, overall, these minor setbacks do little to mar the overall enjoyment. Director Mike Newell, known for films like \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" and \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" has done a considerable job in crafting a fairytale-like ambiance mixed with thrilling action sequences. \n\nIn conclusion, \"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\" is a fairly good popcorn flick. For game fans, it is quite a good representation of the video game, and for those unfamiliar with it, it's still a worthwhile watch for its impressive visual effects and charisma of its leading actors. Despite its narrative shortcomings, it succeeds in being an entertaining, escapist fantasy adventure.",

    "“The celluloid adaptation of Harper Lee's poignant and powerful novel, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is nothing short of a cinematic triumph.

    "The Devil's Advocate is one of those rare cinematic gems that is considerably underrated, but which proves to be an intriguing and deliciously sinister film. Keanu Reeves delivers a solid performance as Kevin Lomax, a small-town lawyer with an undefeated streak, who is enticed into a job at a prestigious law firm in New York led by the enigmatic John Milton, played superbly by Al Pacino. \n\nThe plotline of a man selling his soul to the devil, the moral dilemmas and the metaphysical questions engendered by the film keep the viewer engaged and pondering. The screenplay is brilliantly crafted; the dialogue razor-sharp. Its depiction of corporate law firms, and the metaphor of such firms being akin to hellish entities, is darkly humorous yet deeply thought-provoking. \n\nAl Pacino is exceptional all the way through - from the energy he brings to the screen to his memorably chilling monologue at the end of the film. He is both charmingly devilish and terrifyingly grandiose. Keanu Reeves, however, seems slightly outmatched but nonetheless delivers a creditable performance. Charlize Theron is perfectly cast, delivering a mentally, emotionally tortured performance as Mary Ann, Kevin's wife, who gradually descends into madness as she becomes increasingly alienated in the corporate world of her husband. \n\nWhile the film is essentially about a deal with the devil, it transcends the usual cliches and provides a refreshing spin on this classic narrative. The direct parallels between the savage dog-eat-dog world of corporate law and the concept of hell are seamlessly woven into the story, lending a philosophical depth that is both alarming and impressive. In essence, it is a morality tale masterfully disguised as a thriller.\n\nYet, it is the movie's shocking twists and turns combined with its haunting atmosphere. Coupled with its exploration of moral and ethical choices, The Devil's Advocate commands the viewer's attention right up to its cataclysmic finale. Despite its eerie and chilling vibe, there is a powerful message that will keep you thinking long after the credits roll. \n\nAs a point of criticism, the movie may seem overambitious at points, trying to balance complex themes of morality, corruption, and supernatural elements. Nevertheless, it accomplishes an unusual feat in producing an entertaining narrative that is equally profound.\n\nIn conclusion, The Devil's Advocate is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates well-executed thrillers with enduring substance beyond the usual fare.

    "\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" is a rollicking and explorative sequel that encompasses intense action, sharp-witted humor, and a rich storyline. The film undeniably benefits from the return of director Gore Verbinski and his skillful assembly of distinct nautical tableaus.\n\nJohnny Depp, reprising his role as the unforgettable Captain Jack Sparrow, once again delivers a performance that hits all the right notes. With his eccentric wit and unpredictable nature, Depp manages to outshine others in nearly every scene he appears in. Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly hold their own as Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, infusing the movie with an engaging romantic subplot that adds depth to the story.\n\nBill Nighy is a fantastic new addition to the cast, playing the menacing villain, Davy Jones, with a gleefully wicked essence that is strikingly convincing. His motion-captured performance is an eye-catching marriage between amazing advances in CGI and chilling character acting.\n\nThe cinematography is nothing short of stunning, transporting us to a vivacious era with sweeping landscapes and looming ship battles. Hans Zimmer’s music score is immersive, mood-enhancing, and beautifully rhythmic, easily becoming the pulse of the adventure.\n\nThe narrative has a few downsides though, the pacing might be too swift for some, with the film barely leaving room for the audience to digest one sequence before plunging into the next. And while the plot devices employed might be familiar, they serve the purpose of this roller-coaster ride of a movie.\n\nHowever, a few kinks do not take away from the overall enjoyment. \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" is brimming with magnetic performances, awe-inspiring special effects, and brilliantly choreographed action sequences that make for a buoyant cinematic experience.

Hackman delivers an exceptionally strong performance as a former sheriff who uses his keen understanding of Southern mentality to solve the case. Dafoe's portrayal of an idealistic FBI agent is equally compelling, providing the perfect contrast to Hackman's character. The dynamic between them throughout the movie brilliantly reflects the broader national tensions and conflicting attitudes of the time.\n\nAlan Parker's direction is fantastic with a balance of sensitivity and blunt honesty. The nightmarish vision he creates of Mississippi during this gruesome period in history, marked by cross burnings and lynch mobs, is haunting. \n\nFor its cinematography, the film is top-notch. The visual depiction of 1960s Mississippi includes striking images that provide a strong sense of place and time. It complements Parker's storytelling, inscribing the tension and painful struggle of this historical period into the heart of viewers. \n\nYet, the heart of \"Mississippi Burning\" is its moral indignation against racial hatred. The film unflinchingly shows the brutality of the Ku Klux Klan, the complacency of local law enforcement, and the abusive nature of racial segregation. It serves as a potent reminder of the darker corners of American history and the continuous struggle for justice.\n\nHowever, the film has attracted criticism for the liberties it took with the historical events and the under-representation of black characters. Despite these valid concerns, it's crucial to view \"Mississippi Burning\" as a dramatic interpretation rather than a documentary, with the purpose to evoke an emotional response from the audience about a heinous period of American history.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Mississippi Burning\" is a truly riveting film. With its high-octane performances, skillful direction, and intense portrayal of racial prejudice, it beckons the viewer to reflect on a time not so distant in our history. The film does not offer easy answers, but it forces us to confront the uncomfortable questions – the hallmark of meaningful cinema.",

The haunting score by Howard Shore further amplifies the grim and suspenseful atmosphere of the movie.\n\nHowever, a warning for the faint-hearted - the film is graphic and intense, pulling no punches when it comes to its depiction of violence and psychological manipulation. There are elements that will disturb, but they serve the narrative and are not gratuitous. \n\nIn essence, \"The Silence of the Lambs\" isn’t just a movie, it’s an experience, demanding your attention every second of its runtime. Few movies possess the ability to keep its audience on tenterhooks, satisfied yet disturbed, and yearning for resolution - but this film does it effortlessly.

The film's score, composed by James Horner, is hauntingly beautiful, perfectly complementing the film's narrative and emotional tone.\n\nHowever, what truly sets \"Titanic\" apart is its ability to humanize the tragedy.

The film stars Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, a cynical supernatural detective, cursed with the ability to perceive the half-angels and half-demons that walk the earth.\n\nDespite its divine and infernal themes, the movie's centerpiece is not its supernatural elements, but its gritty, noir-style narrative. At its core, Constantine is a tragic, haunted character, and Reeves plays this role with an impressive level of commitment. His portrayal of a man burdened with a supernatural curse, chain-smoking with a fatalistic attitude, is unforgettable and undoubtedly one of his best performances.\n\nRachel Weisz as Detective Angela Dodson delivers a sterling performance, presenting a determined character without becoming a stereotypical damsel in distress. The chemistry between Reeves and Weisz is palpable, which lays down a solid foundation for the storyline.\n\nVisually, \"Constantine\" is a feast.

The visual effects are a character in itself, helping to establish the eerie atmosphere that engulfs John Constantine's world. There's a brooding, atmospheric quality to the movie that sets it apart from others in its genre.\n\nThe support cast, including Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare, bring their unique strengths to the film. Swinton's portrayal of the archangel Gabriel is unworldly yet magnetic, while Stormare's turn as Satan is truly creepy and hard to forget.\n\nHowever, the movie would have benefited from delving deeper into the lore of the \"Hellblazer\" comics it was based on. While director Francis Lawrence crafts an engaging narrative, the film, at times, feels like it is only scratching the surface of the vast mythology it borrows from. \n\nThe plot might also confuse those unfamiliar with the source material. Despite its flaws, \"Constantine\" remains a film that takes the risk of interpreting a complex hero from the comic book world and doing it justice.\n\n\"On the whole, \"Constantine\" is a visually enticing, character-driven film that balances its supernatural premises with a noir-style narrative.

    "\"Sicario\" is a gripping, hard-hitting crime thriller that exposes the underbelly of the relentless drug war at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. The storytelling is tight and intense with a nerve-wracking realistic depiction of the escalating tension and violence. \n\nEmily Blunt plays Kate Macer, a tough, by-the-book FBI agent who's recruited into a special task force run by a mysterious and unconventional operative, Alejandro, played by Benicio del Toro.

It creates a deep sense of dread and untold horror that stealthily underlies every scene.\n\nWhile \"Sicario\" doesn't shy away from showcasing the harsh realities of the world it portrays, it doesn't do so in an exploitative manner. Instead, it serves as a mirror into a grim and brutal reality, urging its viewers to question the global implications of the drug trade and the secretive operations involved in controlling it. \n\nIn conclusion, \"Sicario\" is a visceral, thought-provoking journey into a world of darkness and deceit, skillfully told and powerfully acted. It isn't an easy watch, but it's a film that deserves to be seen, pondered upon, and undoubtedly respected.",
    "\"Billy Elliot\" is a heartwarming and inspiring film that beautifully captures the struggle and triumph of a young boy pursuing his passion for ballet in a conservative, working-class English town. The film is set against the backdrop of the 1984 miners' strike, adding a layer of social and political depth that enhances the narrative.\n\nJamie Bell delivers a stellar performance as Billy, embodying the character's determination, vulnerability, and raw talent with remarkable authenticity.

    "\"Girl, Interrupted\" is a poignant and deeply moving film that explores the complexities of mental health through the lens of a group of young women in a psychiatric hospital during the 1960s. The film is based on Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name, and it does an excellent job of translating the raw emotion and introspection of the book onto the screen.\n\nThe performances in this film are nothing short of spectacular.

    "\"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" is the third installment in the popular \"Die Hard\" series, and in my opinion, it successfully brings the exciting action, sharp dialogue, and non-stop thrills that fans of the franchise have come to expect. \n\nBruce Willis reprises his role as wise-cracking, stubborn, and resilient New York cop John McClane, and his performance remains as engaging and committed as ever. His chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Harlem store owner Zeus Carver, the unwilling sidekick, is palpable. The two share a banter charged with racial tension and hilarious humour, bringing a fresh twist to the franchise.\n\nJeremy Irons stands out as Simon Gruber, the brother of the infamous villain Hans Gruber from the first film. Irons embodies his character with a chilling ruthlessness and elegance, making him a memorable antagonist. \n\nThe plot of the movie may appear somewhat convoluted at times, but it provides a sturdy backbone to take us from one terrific action set piece to the next. Director John McTiernan uses the city of New York effectively as the film's action playground. There's a claustrophobic, high-stakes subway chase, a bomb threat in a crowded school, and a nerve-wrecking scene involving a suspension cable on a ship among other heart-pounding sequences.\n\nHowever, despite its fast pace and kinetic action scenes, \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" doesn't neglect its character development. McClane's vulnerability and flaws are laid bare, making him more relatable and human. Jackson's character gives the narrative an added depth, extending beyond a mere action-thriller into a commentary on race relations. \n\n\"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" may not be the best in the series (a title still held by the iconic first installment) but it is a worthy follow-up. It never tries to be more than what it is - a high-octane action film with plenty of spectacle and a streak of sardonic humor. Watch it for its engaging performances, well-choreographed action, smart dialogue, and a pulsating score that keeps you on the edge of your seat.",
    "Through the masterful storytelling of \"Saving Mr. Banks,\" viewers are transported to the magical, yet fraught, world of the making of Mary Poppins. The film centers around P.L. Travers, perfectly embodied by the brilliant Emma Thompson, as she grapples with handing over the film rights to her beloved creation, Mary Poppins, to the hands of the insistent and charismatic Walt Disney, portrayed by Tom Hanks. The combination of their performances gives a richly layered narrative that is both charming and emotionally stirring.\n\nOne of the key strengths of \"Saving Mr. Banks\" is its seamless shifts between flashback and present, allowing the audience to delve into Travers' tough childhood and the events that inspired her iconic novel. The insights into Travers' past and her attachment to her created characters make the continuous push and pull between her and Disney feel deeply emotional and connective. The flashbacks are emotional without being overwhelmingly sentimental, revealing the very origins of Mary Poppins subtly but effectively.\n\nMoreover, the film presents an insightful look into the movie-making process of the 1960s. This is especially entertaining to those who are fans of the Disney universe, offering a perfect blend of both the magic and tension that went into creating an iconic film like Mary Poppins.\n\nHanks' portrayal of Disney is spot-on as he masterfully balances the image of the dream-selling businessman with a man having his share of vulnerabilities. Yet, it is Thompson's tremendously evocative performance as P.L. Travers that truly carries the film. Her development throughout the film from cold, and seemingly heartless, to heart wrenching and sympathetic is a feat to behold.\n\nThe only criticism lies possibly in the film's tendency to feel slightly clean-cut and idealistic, toying near a sugar-coated version of probable events. However, this minor limitation does not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment or impact of the film.\n\nMusic plays a significant role in \"Saving Mr. Banks\" with the iconic tunes from \"Mary Poppins\" serving as the infectious backdrop for the battling of wills between Travers and Disney. The songwriters, played by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak, bring both humor and warmth to their roles whilst adding a behind-the-scenes feel to songs which, for many of us, are timelessly ingrained in our hearts.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Saving Mr. Banks\" is a profoundly moving film that cleverly intertwines sadness with humor, reality with fantasy, and the past with the present. It offers a begu",

Beyond the humor, \"Shrek\" delivers some truly tender moments and surprisingly profound messages about acceptance, self-love, and the rejection of superficial beauty standards.\n\nOne of the standout elements of \"Shrek\" is its impeccable animation. Groundbreaking for its time, the film harnesses the power of 3D animation to create a vibrant, richly textured fairy-tale world that is every bit as engaging and absorbing as its well-drawn characters. The attention to detail, beautiful color palette, and the fluid movements only add to the film's visual appeal.\n\nThe soundtrack is also worth mentioning, featuring a fantastic collection of pop songs that not only enhance the film’s storytelling but have also become synonymous with the franchise itself.

Journeying to modern Japan, Logan finds himself thrown into a yakuza-ridden conspiracy involving the past, the future, and an existential crisis. This dystopian setting serves to further explore a more nuanced side of Logan's character, with his supposedly impenetrable veneer of toughness revealing moments of vulnerability and introspection.\n\nDespite the fast-paced action sequences, the storytelling never takes a backseat. Writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank throw surprise curveballs that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The delineation of relationships - between Logan and Mariko (Tao Okamoto), Yukio (Rila Fukushima), and even the slippery Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) - is deftly handled, embroidering the storyline with great emotional depth.\n\nHugh Jackman, as always, embodies the Wolverine perfectly, giving the character enough pathos and underlining why he's one of the most loved (and complex) among Marvel's superhero ranks. From craggy-voiced growls to expressive glances, he embodies Logan's warrior soul and vulnerable psyche. Special mention must also go to Rila Fukushima’s Yukio who is a scene-stealer with her tremendous onscreen energy.\n\nTechnical aspects of the movie deserve applause. The cinematography by Ross Emery is worth noting with its beautiful blend of both urban and natural landscapes of Japan. Not to mention the intensely choreographed fight sequences that keep the adrenaline pumping.\n\nIn conclusion, The Wolverine is a solid, darkly entertaining comic book movie that breaks away from the norm, focusing on character more than spectacle.

It successfully depletes the theme of war by focusing more on the human aspects than typical war action. The compelling performances from Jean Gabin, Dita Parlo, and Pierre Fresnay breathe life into Renoir's vivid characters, each representing diverse societal norms.\n\nThe setting of a German POW camp subtly yet powerfully works to elucidate the class differences and the shared values among the captured French officers and the German commandant. This film masterfully reflects how, despite the war, humans can maintain their dignity and respect for each other.\n\nRenoir's strong screenplay and narrative style transcend geographical and language barriers, while his innovative panning and tracking shots add an organic fluidity to the visual storytelling.\n\nThe movie's title itself - \"La Grande Illusion\" refers to the grand illusions nations and individuals harbor about war - the idea that war determines a clear winner and loser, or that the differences in societal classes mean anything in the face of war.\n\nA moving tale of humanity set against the backdrop of World War I, \"La Grande Illusion\" leaves a profound impact, evoking a strong array of emotions while inviting one to re-think war and its apparent 'illusions'.\n\nAn amalgam of realism and optimism, Renoir's anti-war movie stands as one of the most influential films ever created.

The giant ominous insects and the tranquil Toxic Jungle presentation deserve special mention for their detail, uniqueness, and relevance to the narrative.\n\nHowever, what truly stands out is the movie's powerful environmental message, which resonates even more strongly today than when the film was first released.

Its clever script, sharp editing, and commendable acting across the board, truly makes it a must-watch. Watch it once for the laughs, watch it twice for the intricacies of the clever screenplay and keep watching it for the sheer pleasure of it.",

    "\"Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny\" is a film that perfectly encapsulates the wild, irreverent, and hilarious spirit of its creators, Jack Black and Kyle Gass.

    "\"Children of Men\" is a cinematic masterpiece that brilliantly combines elements of dystopian fiction, political commentary, and human drama. Directed by Alfonso Cuarón, the film is a chilling portrayal of a future where humanity is on the brink of extinction due to global infertility.\n\nThe film's narrative is gripping and thought-provoking, exploring themes of hope, despair, and survival in a world that has lost its future.

The film knows no boundaries in terms of genre as it seamlessly moved across drama, romance, and musicals without compromising the narrative.\n\nFreddie Highmore, as the titular character, delivers an outstanding performance showcasing his exceptional acting prowess while immersing himself into the character with so much depth and sincerity. The supporting acts by Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers only added to the brilliancy of the film. Their portrayal as separated lovers united by music and their lost son was deeply moving and utterly convincing. \n\nThe director, Kirsten Sheridan, has shown immense creativity in blending narrative with music. Music, in this film, is not just an auditory experience, but a visceral one too. Mark Mancina and Hans Zimmer, come together in perfect harmony, to score the film which stands as a character in its own right.\n\nAt its core, \"August Rush\" is about the power of music, its ability to transcend borders and bring people together.

The film's visual aesthetic is gritty and atmospheric, perfectly complementing the narrative's darker themes.

Some plot points feel a bit contrived, and the film occasionally veers into cliché territory.

It's a must-watch for fans of the genre and a solid addition to Tom Cruise's filmography.",

    "\"Uri: The Surgical Strike\" is an exceptional portrayal of India's military prowess encapsulated in a compelling cinematic narrative. Director Aditya Dhar's credits on the movie extend beyond just direction, but also to the intricate screenplay and intense dialogues that add depth to an already powerful story.\n\nPlaying the role of Major Vihaan Singh Shergill, Vicky Kaushal delivers a riveting performance. Kaushal has shown once again why he is reckoned as one of the talented new age actors in Bollywood.

    "\"Alien\" is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time, remaining as thrilling and terrifying today as it was upon its release in 1979. Directed by Ridley Scott, this film is a perfect blend of science fiction and horror, creating a chilling atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\n\nThe film's plot is simple yet effective: a crew aboard a commercial spaceship receives a distress signal from an unexplored planet and, upon investigating, encounters a deadly alien life form. What follows is a tense and claustrophobic game of cat and mouse that is as much about the fear of the unknown as it is about the alien itself.\n\nThe production design is nothing short of spectacular. The Nostromo, the spaceship where most of the film takes place, is a character in itself, with its dark, labyrinthine corridors adding to the sense of dread and isolation. The alien, designed by H.R. Giger, is a terrifying creature that is both fascinating and repulsive, a testament to the power of practical effects.\n\nThe performances are top-notch, with Sigourney Weaver leading the cast as the tough and resourceful Ripley. Her character is a breath of fresh air in a genre often dominated by male heroes, and Weaver's portrayal is both believable and compelling. The rest of the cast, including Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, and Ian Holm, deliver solid performances, creating a crew that is relatable and, therefore, all the more tragic.\n\nThe film's pacing is deliberate, with Scott taking his time to build tension and suspense. The result is a film that is as much about anticipation as it is about action. The score by Jerry Goldsmith complements the film perfectly, adding to the overall sense of unease.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Alien\" is a landmark film that has influenced countless others in the years since its release. It is a testament to the power of storytelling, atmosphere, and character development, proving that sometimes, less is indeed more. Whether you're a fan of science fiction, horror, or cinema in general, \"Alien\" is a must-watch.",
    "Despite having all the elements of a classical 80's movie mix, Over the Top runs out of fuel rather quickly. Sylvester Stallone gives a genuinely earnest performance as Lincoln Hawk, a struggling trucker and arm-wrestler, who suddenly must take custody of his estranged son. The relationship between Lincoln and his son forms the heart of the film and Stallone, baring his obvious emotional depth, does an excellent job at it. However, the film's inability to surpass its predictable script ultimately becomes its downfall. \n\nThe director, Menahem Golan, tries to cleverly interweave the themes of family, redemption, and sportsmanship, but the forced nature of the plot points and the overuse of clichés make it difficult for the viewers to stay hooked. Even the high-stake arm wrestling bouts in the climax feel more like a diversion, rather than an exciting, edge-of-your-seat experience.\n\nOn a technical level, the film doesn't help itself either. The cinematography is distinctly average with uninspiring camera work that adds little to the proceedings, and the less said about the movie's dated soundtrack, the better. \n\nOn the bright side, the performances are surprisingly decent. Stallone, as mentioned earlier, commits to his role and you'll find yourself caring for him; his character's frustration, pain, and determination are palpable. Even his co-stars, notably David Mendenhall as his son and Robert Loggia as his father-in-law, deliver credible performances, despite sub-standard dialogues and direction.\n\nOverall, Over the Top tries to be everything at once- a family drama, an inspiring sports story, and an emotional reconciliation saga- but unfortunately, it fails to be wholly satisfying in any of these aspects. The resultant product ends up as a middling melodramatic fare that might appeal to Stallone's die-hard fans, but is unlikely to make an impact otherwise.",
    "\"Wonder Woman\" is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. The film is a perfect blend of action, drama, and humor, with a strong and inspiring female lead. Gal Gadot's portrayal of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman is nothing short of spectacular. She embodies the character's strength, compassion, and determination with such grace and conviction that it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role.\n\nThe film's plot is engaging and well-paced, with a good balance of character development and action sequences. The World War I setting adds a unique twist to the typical superhero narrative, and the film does an excellent job of exploring the complexities of war and the moral dilemmas it presents.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, also delivers strong performances. The chemistry between Gadot and Pine is palpable, adding depth to their characters' relationship. The film's villains are also well-developed, with motivations that are complex and believable.\n\nThe action sequences are thrilling and well-choreographed, showcasing Wonder Woman's powers in all their glory. The film's visuals are stunning, with vibrant colors and detailed set designs that bring the world of Wonder Woman to life.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is its message of hope and love. Despite the horrors of war, Diana remains steadfast in her belief in humanity's capacity for good. This optimism, combined with her unwavering determination to fight for justice, makes her a truly inspiring hero.\n\n\"Wonder Woman\" is not just a great superhero film, but a great film in general. It's a testament to the power of strong storytelling and compelling characters. Whether you're a fan of superhero films or not, \"Wonder Woman\" is a must-see.",
    "\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is a magical journey that brings C.S. Lewis's beloved fantasy novel to life. The film is a visual spectacle, with stunning special effects and breathtaking cinematography that truly transport the audience to the mystical world of Narnia.\n\nThe story follows the four Pevensie children, who stumble upon a wardrobe that serves as a portal to Narnia, a world filled with mythical creatures and a prophecy that foretells their arrival. The performances by the young actors are commendable, particularly Georgie Henley as Lucy, who brings a sense of innocence and wonder to the film.\n\nTilda Swinton is captivating as the White Witch, embodying the character's icy cruelty with a chilling performance. Liam Neeson's voice work as Aslan, the majestic lion, is powerful and commanding, adding depth to the character.\n\nThe film does not shy away from the darker elements of the story, presenting a world at war and characters who must make difficult choices. Yet, it also captures the sense of wonder and adventure that is integral to the novel. The battle scenes are well-executed, providing thrilling action without overshadowing the story's emotional core.\n\nThe film's score, composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, is another highlight. It enhances the film's epic feel and beautifully complements the on-screen action.\n\nHowever, the film does have its flaws. Some of the dialogue feels stilted and the pacing can be uneven at times. Additionally, while the film stays largely faithful to the source material, some changes may not sit well with purist fans of the book.\n\nDespite these minor issues, \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is a compelling adaptation that successfully brings the magic and wonder of Narnia to the big screen. It is a film that can be enjoyed by both children and adults, offering a captivating story, memorable characters, and a message of courage and hope that resonates long after the credits roll.",

However, his peaceful existence is disrupted when his land is invaded by a host of fairy tale creatures, leading him on a quest to rescue a princess in order to reclaim his home. The character of Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers, is wonderfully developed. He is gruff and intimidating on the outside, but beneath his tough exterior lies a heart of gold. \n\nThe supporting characters are equally memorable. Eddie Murphy's Donkey provides much of the film's comic relief, while Cameron Diaz's Princess Fiona is a refreshing departure from the typical damsel in distress. The villainous Lord Farquaad, voiced by John Lithgow, is both amusing and menacing.\n\nThe animation in \"Shrek\" is top-notch, with a vibrant color palette and meticulous attention to detail. The film's soundtrack, featuring songs by Smash Mouth and others, perfectly complements the on-screen action and adds to the overall enjoyment of the movie.\n\nWhat truly sets \"Shrek\" apart, however, is its clever and often irreverent humor. The film is filled with witty dialogue, visual gags, and numerous references to other fairy tales and popular culture, making it a joy to watch for both children and adults.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Shrek\" is a charming, funny, and heartwarming film that has stood the test of time. It offers a fresh take on the fairy tale genre, with memorable characters, stunning animation, and a fantastic soundtrack. Whether you're a fan of animation or just looking for a great movie to watch, \"Shrek\" is a must-see.",
    "\"Rush\" is a thrilling cinematic experience that brilliantly captures the high-octane world of Formula 1 racing. Directed by Ron Howard, the film is a gripping portrayal of the intense rivalry between two of the sport's most iconic figures - James Hunt and Niki Lauda.\n\nThe film is a masterclass in storytelling, with a narrative that is as engaging as it is emotionally charged. The script, penned by Peter Morgan, is sharp, witty, and insightful, offering a fascinating glimpse into the lives of these two racing legends. The dialogue is crisp and engaging, and the pacing is spot-on, ensuring that there's never a dull moment.\n\nThe performances are nothing short of spectacular.

    "\"Alien: Resurrection\" is a film that, while not reaching the heights of its predecessors, still manages to deliver a thrilling and visually stunning experience. The fourth installment in the Alien franchise, it brings back the iconic character of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), albeit in a different form, and introduces a new set of characters that add a fresh dynamic to the story.\n\nThe film's plot, which revolves around the resurrection of Ripley through cloning and the attempts to recreate the Xenomorph species, is intriguing and filled with suspense. The script, penned by Joss Whedon, is filled with his trademark wit and humor, which provides a nice counterbalance to the film's darker elements.\n\nSigourney Weaver's performance is, as always, a standout. She brings a new depth to the character of Ripley, portraying her as a more complex and conflicted figure. The supporting cast, including Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman, also deliver solid performances.\n\nThe film's visual effects are impressive, with the Xenomorphs looking more terrifying than ever. The set design is atmospheric and claustrophobic, effectively conveying the sense of dread and tension that permeates the film. The action sequences are well-executed and exciting, with the underwater sequence being a particular highlight.\n\nHowever, \"Alien: Resurrection\" does have its flaws. The pacing can be uneven at times, and some of the plot developments feel forced. Additionally, while the film does a good job of building suspense, it doesn't quite match the sheer terror of the original \"Alien\" or the intense action of \"Aliens\".\n\nIn conclusion, \"Alien: Resurrection\" is a worthy addition to the Alien franchise. While it may not be perfect, it offers plenty of thrills, impressive visuals, and a compelling performance from Sigourney Weaver. It's a must-watch for fans of the series and a solid choice for anyone looking for a suspenseful and visually striking sci-fi film.",
    "\"Get Him to the Greek\" is a surprisingly amusing ride that succeeds in capturing the extravagant and unpredictable world of rock and roll whilst giving us some solid laugh-out-loud moments. This wacky comedy revolves around a beleaguered record company intern, Aaron Green, commendably portrayed by Jonah Hill, who is assigned the herculean task of escorting the unconventional British rock star, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), to his concert at Los Angeles' Greek Theater.\n\nRussell Brand steals the show as an obnoxious caricature of a washed-up rock star, a character he had previously delved into in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\" He brings a unique charisma to his role, making Aldous a hard-to-hate mess of egoistic charm and vulnerability. Meanwhile, Jonah Hill mastered his character's panicked, shell-shocked reactions that serve as a fantastic contrast to Brand's brash eccentricity.\n\nThe dialogue in \"Get Him to the Greek\" is sharp, witty, and most importantly, funny. However, the film goes beyond mere laughs, incorporating a strong emotional core. Amid the raucous debauchery and amusing slapstick sequences, the narrative navigates the messy world of addiction and the pressure of fame, lending depth to the otherwise boisterous screenplay.\n\nDespite the steady stream of laughs, some viewers might not appreciate the film's occasional dips into raunchy humor.

Based on a real-life CIA mission, the film seamlessly combines elements of suspense, drama, and humor to deliver a pulse-pounding experience that remains intriguing from beginning to end.\n\nBen Affleck's performance is commendable both in front of, and behind, the camera.

Despite knowing the outcome, the film leaves viewers on the edge of their seats, holding their breath until the climactic conclusion – a true testament to its power. Highly recommended.",
    "\"Dawn of the Dead\", directed by George A. Romero, is a solid work of cinematic art that thrills, frightens, and provokes deep thought, keeping you on the edge of your seat for its entirety. It masterfully blends elements of horror, suspense, and social commentary into a gripping narrative that is as relevant today as it was at the time of its release in 1978.\n\nThe film's plot follows a group of survivors who take refuge in a suburban shopping mall against the backdrop of a society collapsing under the weight of a relentless zombie apocalypse. The premise may sound simple on paper, but it's the layered subtext, clever writing, and distinct characterizations that elevate the story beyond your average horror flick.\n\nRomero's thematic exploration of consumer culture through the lens of a zombie apocalypse is both biting and bold. By turning the mall - a symbol of consumerism - into both a sanctuary and a trap, Romero offers a critical look at American society's blind worship of consumption. The zombies, mindlessly wandering around the mall drawn by faint memories of their human lives, resemble the hollow satisfaction derived from materialism.\n\nBeyond its social commentary, \"Dawn of the Dead\" sure knows how to deliver a scare. The practical effects are astonishing, especially considering the time of the movie's release, offering grisly and graphic scenes of zombie violence that still cause shudders. The pacing of the film ensures that the suspense is not compromised, skillfully switching between adrenaline-pumping action and quieter moments of dread.\n\nThe performances by the lead actors are definitely worth mentioning. They bring authenticity to their characters, evoking sympathy and terror in equal measures. The dynamic between these characters adds another layer of tension and contributes to the overall dread that permeates the film.\n\nDespite its age, \"Dawn of the Dead\" remains a high-point in the horror genre and a potent spectacle of sociopolitical commentary. The film stands as a testament to Romero's knack for blending gruesome horror with thoughtful critique, making it a must-watch for genre enthusiasts and casual movie-goers alike. Although it may be brutal and bleak, there's a strange beauty in its nihilism that keeps you hooked till the very end.",

Her chemistry with Cruise is palpable, and she brings a sense of authenticity and depth to her character, Sofia. Cameron Diaz, in a supporting role, also delivers a standout performance, adding another layer of complexity to the narrative.\n\nThe film's narrative is a labyrinth of twists and turns, keeping the audience on their toes as they try to decipher what is real and what is not.

The cinematography is top-notch, and the film's score adds another layer of depth to the overall viewing experience.\n\nHowever, \"Flight\" is not a film for the faint-hearted.

    "\"Alexander\" is an ambitious epic that attempts to recount the life story of one of history's most revered military strategists, Alexander the Great. Oliver Stone, the director, is known for his adventurous spirit when it comes to filmmaking, and this is evident in \"Alexander\". The film indeed features stunning battle scenes, copious historical details and it does a commendable job of portrayering the grandeur of the ancient world.\n\nHowever, the film stumbles as it fails to create a cogent narrative, resulting in it being disappointingly less than the sum of its parts. The dialogue sometimes seems overwritten and the characters aren't developed as thoroughly as one might expect in a film of this magnitude.\n\nColin Farrell, as Alexander, delivers a spirited performance and brings an admirable level of intensity to his character. However, he doesn’t quite successfully convey the strategic genius and charisma that Alexander the Great was renowned for. The supporting cast is good, with solid performances from Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and Jared Leto, but what they can do is also limited by the script.\n\nVisually, \"Alexander\" is spectacular with its majestic set designs and detailed costumes that effectively portray the era. The film’s cinematography is strikingly beautiful along with its heart-pounding battle sequences that are depicted in brutal detail. Despite all this, \"Alexander\" can seem overlong and a bit verbose with its 175-minute running time, leading to certain parts feeling drawn out and tedious.\n\nThe movie, while a grand spectacle, lacks a solid narrative and strong character development imperative for a historical figure as complex as Alexander. In trying to cover so many aspects of his life, the movie loses sight of what makes a compelling biopic: a clear storyline, immersive characters and a closer look into the protagonist’s psyche. With less focus on the spectacle and some more on the intricacies of Alexander's character, the film might have been a triumph. Nonetheless, for history buffs and fans of epic war sequences, \"Alexander\" might still be worth a watch.",

    "In \"Taken 2,\" Liam Neeson returns as the relentless Bryan Mills, showcasing his impressive array of lethal skills and unwavering determination. Although admittedly heavily reliant on the success of its predecessor, this sequel manages to provide significant action sequences and nail-biting suspense that fans of the first film will appreciate.\n\nLiam Neeson delivers a robust performance, convincingly portraying a man who will stop at nothing to protect his family. He is as fearless and proficient as ever, cementing his on-screen presence as a credible action hero. Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen also return to reprise their roles, providing fair performances despite the limited character development in the script.\n\nSet in picturesque Istanbul, the cinematography is laudably vivid, contrasting the city's historical beauty against its increasingly dangerous landscape, effectively serving the narrative. The action sequences are thrillingly choreographed, albeit with a hint of predictability, but they certainly do not disappoint.\n\nWhat \"Taken 2\" lacks in originality, it compensates for with its adrenaline-pumping car chases, riveting fight scenes, and the overarching, commendable father-daughter relationship. This sequel strives to extend the riveting narrative of the original, an effort that should be admired despite its shortcomings.\n\nHowever, like many sequels, \"Taken 2\" struggles to capture the novelty and raw excitement of the first installment. Still, it functions effectively as a continuation of Bryan Mills' story.

However, those seeking intricate plot advancements or new narrative twists might find it slightly underwhelming.

Director Roman Polanski, in his Hollywood debut, created a truly chilling tale that lingers in the mind long after viewing.\n\nMia Farrow delivers a phenomenal performance as the naive and increasingly terrified Rosemary Woodhouse. The subtle transformation she undergoes as she descends from innocence to horror-stricken paranoia is a masterclass in acting. John Cassavetes is equally impressive as Guy Woodhouse, a character who adds to the underlying tension of the movie. Their chemistry, alongside the captivating performances from Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer said volumes about the strength of characterization within the film.\n\nWhat sets \"Rosemary's Baby\" apart from many other horror movies is the building sense of dread that permeates each scene. It isn’t reliant on jumpscares or grand special effects. Instead, the true horror stems from its unsettling atmosphere, its character dynamics, and the implications of its plot.\n\nPolanski's direction is impeccable. The gloomy and claustrophobic atmosphere, in combination with the unhurried pace, gradually builds suspense while disquieting viewers. Every carefully composed shot, every eerie note of Krzysztof Komeda's score, contributes to the pervasive unease.\n\nBut, special mention must go to the screenplay, based on Ira Levin's novel of the same name. It successfully maintains the complex narrative, intertwining the supernatural elements with a palpable sense of reality. This perfect balance involves the audience on both an emotional and intellectual level and prompts a reevaluation of everyday interactions, which is where its true horror lies.\n\n\"Rosemary's Baby\" is more than a classic horror movie.

    "\"Kingpin\" is a unique blend of comedy and sports drama that manages to entertain and amuse in equal measure. The Farrelly Brothers have once again demonstrated their knack for creating hilarious and memorable characters, with Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid delivering standout performances.\n\nHarrelson plays Roy Munson, a once-promising professional bowler whose career is derailed by a tragic accident. His portrayal of Munson is both humorous and poignant, making the audience root for him despite his many flaws. Quaid, on the other hand, is a revelation as Ishmael, an Amish man with a natural talent for bowling. His innocent and naive demeanor provides a perfect contrast to Harrelson's cynical and world-weary Munson.\n\nThe plot is a classic underdog story, with Munson and Ishmael teaming up to compete in a high-stakes bowling tournament.

The bowling scenes are particularly well-executed, combining tension and humor in a way that few sports movies manage to achieve.\n\nThe humor in \"Kingpin\" is typical of the Farrelly Brothers, with a mix of slapstick, gross-out gags, and clever one-liners. While some of the jokes may be a bit crude for some viewers, the film never loses its heart or its sense of fun.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Bill Murray as the villainous Ernie McCracken, is also excellent. Murray's performance is delightfully over-the-top, and he clearly relishes the opportunity to play such a despicable character.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Kingpin\" is a hilarious and heartwarming film that deserves to be recognized as one of the best sports comedies of the 90s. Its unique blend of humor, drama, and sports action makes it a must-watch for any fan of the genre.",

    "Watching \"Victory\" was a pleasantly surprising experience. For a film grounded in the midst of World War II, it remarkably manages to fold in an engaging soccer saga. The director intricately harmonizes the despair of a POW camp with the passion, hope, and camaraderie found in sports and yields a film that is both intense and inspiring.\n\nMichael Caine delivers a commendable performance as Captain Robert Hatch. He portrays the character's dilemma and determination so well that it leaves a lasting impression. Sylvester Stallone too, much to my surprise, ditches his usual action hero vibe for a more character-driven persona. Meanwhile, Pele's exhilarating soccer sequences add a whole layer of credibility and thrill to the whole narrative.\n\nThe cinematography is pretty solid for a film of its time, capturing the bleak atmosphere of a prison camp and contrasting it with the exhilarating soccer scenes. The score too is suitably stirring, heightening the tension, drama, and eventually, the jubilation.\n\nOn the downside, the plot is somewhat predictable, a setback that is, however, overshadowed by the movie's finer aspects and the sheer pleasure of watching a well-made sports-war drama unfold. You could argue that the film takes creative liberties with historical facts, but that's almost a given in most works of fiction, and does not really diminish the film's appeal.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Victory\" strikes a fine balance between a war film and a sports drama. It offers a captivating story, punctuated with strong performances, and an ending that leaves you with a lingering sense of hope and triumph. It's an enjoyable watch if you're a fan of either genre or just appreciate good cinema.",

He offers viewers an unprecedented portrayal of the character, meticulously unpicking the layers of Fleck's abused and fractured psyche, with an astounding depth of emotion that makes your skin crawl. His haunting laughter and the uncomfortably long dance sequences create an underlying rhythmic insanity; acting as a perfect reflection of his chaotic mental state.\n\nTodd Phillips does a phenomenal job in directing a film that's more psychological drama than traditional comic book fare. His commitment to depicting the grim, dystopian landscape of Gotham City in the 1980s provides a fitting backdrop for Arthur's turbulent descent into madness. The plot delivers a sobering critique of society's treatment towards mental health and the disastrous consequences of its neglect.\n\nThe cinematography is impeccable, capturing the grit and grime of Gotham with an unforgiving lens, setting the tone for the film's narrative. The subtle instances of the color motif, the near expressionistic lighting, and the evocative score, all fuse together perfectly to evoke a sense of dread and unease. \n\n\"Joker\" is a cinematic masterpiece that is unquestionably disturbing and polarizing, but therein lies its beauty. It's not an easy watch, but it's one that's impossible to forget. It is thought-provoking, bold, and above all, an unsettling reflection of society, and the monsters it can inadvertently create. This film boldly goes where few dare, blazing its own trail and challenging conventional wisdom about what comic book movies can be. \"Joker\" is not just a film; it's a sociopolitical statement wrapped in the guise of a character study, making it one of the most profound films of the year.",

The color palette celebrates vibrant hues and evokes an array of emotions, effortlessly pulling viewers deeper into the storyline.\n\nEqually impressive is the film's soundtrack, composed by Joe Hisaishi. The orchestral score perfectly complements the onscreen action, further enhancing the emotions depicted in each scene. Whether evoking an atmosphere of foreboding, melancholy, or joy, the music is an integral part of the entire viewing experience.\n\nEach character in \"Spirited Away\", much like its environment, is intricately crafted.

It never shies away from exploring the harsh realities and moral ambiguities of war.\n\nIn the overture of films about war, \"Paths of Glory\" stands tall as a sharp criticism of the corruption, disregard for human life, and needless waste that constitute the reality of warfare.

The cinematography is top-notch, capturing the period setting with authenticity. The special effects, particularly the aerial sequences, are impressive, even by today's standards.\n\nHowever, \"1941\" is not without its flaws.

    "\"In The Land of Blood and Honey\" is a provocative, evocative piece of cinema that plunges its viewers into the horrors of the Bosnian war through an uneasy romance (or rather lack thereof). It's an opus that springs from the heart of Angelina Jolie, making her directorial debut with this hard-hitting war drama.\n\nThe movie follows two protagonists, Ajla and Danijel, whose romance is sparked against the backdrop of the war, invoking a realistic and vivid portrayal of love in times of war. Jolie does a striking job of juxtapirizing these opposites and building an emotional terrain that forces us to navigate the human cost of war.\n\nThe performances by Zana Marjanovic and Goran Kostic as Ajla and Danijel, respectively, are thoroughly compelling. The nuanced performances effectively explore the depths of trauma, raw human instinct, questionable morality and the potent desire to survive.\n\nJolie's narrative is dense, emotionally charged and unflinching in its depiction of a bitter conflict. She does a commendable job showing real, horrifying war scenes and not pulling punches for the sake of the audience's comfort. The script is grittily realistic, echoing the historical atrocities that took place and are often shied away from in cinematic adaptations.\n\nHowever, the plot progression can feel disjointed at times and the character development, especially of minor characters, lacks depth. Additionally, the film's pessimistic tone might not sit well with everyone, and it could use a bit more subtlety and complexity in places.\n\nStill, the film's technical craftsmanship is impressive, with excellent cinematography offering stark and intimate images of war. The music, composed by Gabriel Yared, beautifully complements the grim yet moving nature of the storyline.\n\n\"In the Land of Blood and Honey\" is not light-hearted or easy viewing, but it's a sincere, ambitious effort from Jolie to throw light upon a grim chapter of history.

    "\"John Wick\" is a high-octane, adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that redefines the action genre.

The film is a masterclass in action choreography, with Reeves performing most of his own stunts, adding a layer of authenticity that elevates the film above its contemporaries.\n\nThe narrative is simple yet effective, providing a solid foundation for the relentless action sequences.

This emotional core gives the audience a reason to root for Wick, making the action sequences all the more engaging.\n\nThe world-building in \"John Wick\" is subtle yet immersive.

    "\"Good Night, and Good Luck.\" is a masterful piece of cinema that brilliantly captures the tension and fear of the McCarthy era. The black and white cinematography is not just a stylistic choice, but a narrative tool that effectively transports the audience back to the 1950s, a time when television was still in its infancy and the Cold War was at its peak.\n\nGeorge Clooney, who co-wrote and directed the film, shows a deep understanding of the era and the issues at stake. His direction is subtle yet powerful, allowing the story to unfold naturally without resorting to melodrama or sensationalism. The screenplay, co-written with Grant Heslov, is sharp, intelligent, and thought-provoking, raising questions about the role of media in society that are still relevant today.\n\nThe performances are uniformly excellent.

    "\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\" certainly lived up to the legacy of its preceding installments. While it may not have been as groundbreaking as the original \"Terminator\" or as emotionally and visually engaging as \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", it still served as a commendable follow-up and contributed necessary plot elements for the continuation of the franchise. \n\nThe casting of the movie was one of its main strengths. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprised his role as the Terminator with the same convincing intensity that made him the perfect fit for the role originally.

Nick Stahl was up to the task as John Connor, depicting his internal struggle and coming-of-age journey with authenticity. \n\nWhere the movie could have improved was its reliance on special effects. While the CGI was impressive for the time, it seemed that the movie leaned on it too heavily at times, threatening to overshadow the plot and character development.\n\nNonetheless, the execution of the overall storyline was solid, effectively bridging the gap between the second and fourth movies. The ending was crafted well and managed to leave audiences on edge, hungry for the next installment. The movie remained faithful to the essence of the \"Terminator\" series, packing loads of action, depicting the relentless battle against machines, and pondering on deep existential questions.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\" offers an engaging viewing experience, despite its minor flaws.

    "\"Armageddon\" is a high-octane, apocalyptic thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat from its explosive opening to its climactic finale. Directed by Michael Bay, the embodiment of big, loud and flashy Hollywood extravagance, the film follows a rag-tag team of oil riggers who are humanity's last hope against an impending asteroid collision.\n\nAt the heart of \"Armageddon\" is the amazing ensemble cast led by Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck. Their camaraderie, conflicts, and heroism provide the emotional heart of this otherwise action-packed blockbuster. Willis' performance as Harry Stamper, the tough, no-nonsense leader of the drilling team, is one of his most unforgettable. Equally commendable is Affleck, who brings charm and humor to his portrayal of A.J., a young hotshot driller and Willis' character's pseudo-son. The supporting cast, including Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Billy Bob Thornton, is top-notch and bring plenty of comic relief amidst the doom and gloom.\n\nThe film features great visuals, courtesy of Industrial Light & Magic, and a booming, stirring score by Trevor Rabin. The scenes in space, both on the asteroid and aboard the two space shuttles, are breathtaking. They portray the vastness and unfathomable nature of space brilliantly. The soundtrack, featuring the now iconic 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing' by Aerosmith, underscores the emotional depth of the film.\n\nHowever, don't expect hard science in this sci-fi flick. \"Armageddon\" is an unabashedly fanciful disaster film that focuses more on thrilling set-pieces than scientific accuracy. Yet, beneath the destruction and mayhem, Bay and screenwriters Jonathan Hensleigh and J.J. Abrams manage to inject just enough pathos and sentimentality to make the viewer genuinely interested in the fate of its characters.\n\n\"Armageddon\" might not be for the highbrow audience seeking intellectual stimulation, but it delivers what it promises - escapism at its grandest scale. It's about ordinary individuals doing extraordinary things to save their world. At the end of the day, it's an emotional ride about love, sacrifice, and camaraderie with a good old American can-do spirit.

Akshay Kumar gives a stellar performance as Ranjit Katyal, a businessman who evolves from a ruthless profiteer into a selfless hero, reminding us that in times of adversity, the most ordinary people can achieve extraordinary feats. Nimrat Kaur as Amrita Katyal is not far behind and delivers an equally convincing performance.\n\n\"Airlift\" is an underrated gem that balances patriotism and entertainment masterfully.

The film is a riveting blend of historical intrigue, religious conspiracy, and high-stakes adventure that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.\n\nTom Hanks delivers a compelling performance as Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist who is unwittingly thrust into a deadly web of secrets and lies. Hanks' portrayal of Langdon is both intelligent and relatable, making the audience root for him as he unravels the mysteries of the Da Vinci Code.

The director possesses an innate understanding of the source material that shines through every frame, endowing it with an unexpected freshness that keeps one riveted from start to finish.\n\nRight off the bat, the film's visual element impresses immensely. The color palette is masterfully chosen to reflect the narrative's increasing darkness and melancholy, and the cinematography is beyond stunning, making even the utmost chaos seem like a compelling, tragic ballet.\n\nHowever, the true driving force of the movie is the riveting performances by the cast. Macbeth is played with incredible conviction. The dye of the character’s ruthless ambition and looming guilt is powerfully portrayed. Lady Macbeth is equally captivating, imbued with a terrifying determination and layered vulnerability that breathes new life into the character. \n\nWe should also commend the director for the film's incredibly atmospheric sound design. The subtle background music, combined with the raw sounds of nature and battles, creates an audioscape that's as enthralling as the film is visually. \n\nThe screenplay stays true to Shakespeare's original work, while the dialogues retain their lyrical quality, they are pronounced with such believability that they seem less like verses from a 400-year-old play and more like actual conversations during those dire circumstances.\n\nAs the movie draws to its devastating climax, it leaves the audience with a profound silence, echoing the haunting reality of unchecked ambition and its eventual downfall. It also prompts the audience to reflect on the destructive nature of power and guilt, themes that remain as relevant today as they were during Shakespeare’s time.\n\nOverall, \"Macbeth\" is not just an adaptation; it's more of a reimagining that compels the audience to see a well-known tragedy from a fresh perspective.

Every performance in the film, from that of Sean Connery’s seasoned mentor to Robert De Niro's Al Capone, leaves a lasting impression that resonates well after the end credits roll. \n\nKudos to David Mamet for crafting such a fantastic screenplay. He does an excellent job of sketching out the characters while maintaining the intricate plot set during the Prohibition-era Chicago. The exchanges between Eliot Ness, played by Kevin Costner, and his team of disparate officers nicknamed 'The Untouchables,' not only build suspense but also furnish viewers with intricate details about the characters’ internal worlds.\n\nAside from the brilliant performances by the key players, the supporting cast also shines. Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith's remarkable depiction of law enforcement agents battling their inner conflicts lend an edge to the narrative. The production design, recreating 1930s Chicago, is aesthetically pleasing and further enhances the movie’s authenticity.\n\nHowever, the real gem of the film lies within the captivating cinematography and its infamous tension-filled staircase scene, which is in itself worth the price of admission. Stylistically, the film utilizes slow-motion sequences to not only emphasize the gravity of the situation but also to highlight De Palma's unique eye for visual storytelling.\n\nOne cannot forget to mention Ennio Morricone's evocative, Oscar-nominated score. The score, punctuating the film’s inflection points, creates a palpable atmosphere of danger, uncertainty, and heroism. \n\nIn conclusion, \"The Untouchables” is a stellar movie illustrating the Prohibition era's struggle against brutality and corruption. While it might be considered violent for some, the film nevertheless delivers a masterfully executed storyline, stellar performances, and exquisite cinematography, making it a must-watch for anyone who appreciates cinema at its finest.",
    "\"Sucker Punch\", directed by Zack Snyder, stands as a divisive entrant into the cinematic universe, eliciting strong reactions from its audience; people seem to either love it, or hate it. This genre-bending film utilizes elements of action, fantasy, steampunk, and pure imagination to tell a dark and twisted tale that subverts reality and fantasy.\n\nFrom the onset, \"Sucker Punch\" is both mesmerizing and visually breathtaking. Snyder's craftsmanship is exquisite; the stunning special effects, complex fight sequences, and atmospheric settings imbued with a sense of dreamlike surrealism are unquestionably remarkable. The film's aesthetics seem to echo the essence of a high-budget video game, with our protagonists transitioning from one fantastical mission to another, adding a unique dimension to the flag section of movies.\n\nOur protagonist, Baby Doll, excellently portrayed by Emily Browning, is commendable. Her performance as a troubled young woman subjected to a horrid reality is both heartfelt and engrossing. The rest of the cast, including Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung deliver strong performances, playing characters that are both complex and enigmatic.\n\nThe plot, however, is where \"Sucker Punch\" falls short. While it does present an interesting mix of multiple realities and symbolism, its complexity can often leave viewers perplexed. The film demands the audience's full attention and even then, it may require multiple viewings to fully comprehend its layered narrative.\n\nFurthermore, while some may appreciate the feminist subtext underlining the film - the idea of women reclaiming their power from oppressive systems - others may find its execution potentially problematic. The hyper-sexualization of its protagonists can be seen as contradictory to its purported feminist message.\n\nHowever, it is the film's multilayered approach which sets it apart. \"Sucker Punch\" is by no means a traditional narrative; it works on different levels and actively challenges conventional storytelling. For those open to a unique, visually stunning, and potentially disconcerting cinematic experience, \"Sucker Punch\" may resonate in unexpected ways. \n\nIn closing, \"Sucker Punch\" is an innovative piece of cinema that revels in its audacious absurdity and visual audacity. Despite its flaws, the film's fearless creativity and deep metaphorical underpinnings deserve recognition. It's not a film for everyone, but for those willing to dive into its chaotic, dreamlike world, it presents a riveting, though complicated, exploration of reality, fantasy and empowerment.",
    "\"21 Jump Street\" seamlessly melds the aesthetics of buddy-cop action flicks, the wit of self-aware comedy, and the nostalgia of its namesake 1980s TV series into a film that is both entertaining and refreshingly smart. With a delightfully irreverent script, the movie manages to satirize the clichés of both high school dramas and police procedurals, while still constructing a humorous, authentic narrative arc that audiences can invest in.\n\nLeading the film are Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, two actors who may seem mismatched at first glance, but together create an uncanny and comedic chemistry. Hill’s geeky, quick-witted persona plays hilariously off of Tatum's athletic, somewhat dim-witted character. Both actors exhibit tremendous comedic timing and engage equally well in the film's more dramatic and action-filled scenes.\n\nOne of the film's most praiseworthy aspects is its script. It ingeniously combines satirical commentary on the genre, clever one-liners and a good heart at its core. It also successfully manages to poke fun at its origins, delivering plenty of nostalgic flashbacks for fans of the original series, while updating the story for a modern audience. You needn't be familiar with the series to enjoy the movie, though. It stands firmly on its own, independent of its namesake.\n\nThe action sequences scattered throughout the movie are well-crafted and exciting. They ride the line between being genuinely thrilling and just a little over-the-top. This balance enhances and mirrors the film's tone as a whole, offering an experience that is playfully self-aware and still energetically entertaining.\n\nThe supporting cast is also excellent, playing their roles with comedic precision, further adding to the film's overall enjoyment. Ice Cube, as the perpetually angry police captain, is a standout, delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie.\n\n\"21 Jump Street\" proves that an adaptation can preserve the essence of its source material while evolving in a way that feels timely and innovative. It is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but offers a balanced mix of comedy, action, and heart. A must-watch for anyone seeking a fun and light-hearted entertainment.",
    "\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\" is an ambitious, genre-bending depiction of one of America's most revered presidents. Melding historical figures with fantastical horror elements, the film forges a path that is, as you might expect, an entertaining and wild ride.\n\nAt its core, the movie takes its premise of Abraham Lincoln moonlighting as a vampire slayer surprisingly seriously for such a high concept idea - an aspect which works both for and against it. Benjamin Walker, in the title role, handles the material commendably, embodying a gravitas and physicality befitting of Honest Abe and lending authentic connectivity and emotional resonance amid the pervasive supernatural chaos.\n\nThe film, directed by Timur Bekmambetov, is visually striking; from brooding Southern gothic landscapes to frenetic fight scenes rendered with stylistic flourish. Particularly notable are the action scenes which, thanks to Bekmambetov's kinetic direction, deliver plenty of well-choreographed thrills. \n\nHowever, despite the film’s audacious conceit, it occasionally succumbs to overwrought solemnity, which sometimes acts to its detriment. The tonal balance between historical drama and action-horror flick is frequently tested, as it veers from earnest political commentary to gratuitous vampire slaughter in the blink of an eye. \n\nThe supporting cast, including Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd Lincoln and Dominic Cooper as Henry Sturges, Lincoln’s mentor, all make the most of the material they’re given. Yet, it’s clear that this is primarily the Abraham and his ax show.\n\nOverall, \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\" is truly one-of-its-kind. For those with an appetite for its unique flavor of outlandish, revisionist historical fantasy, it provides a wildly entertaining spectacle. It's a movie that, much like its presidential protagonist’s secret life, exists within two worlds. Despite its outlandish concept, the end product is an oddly sincere action-horror film, steeped in stretches of pure cinematic entertainment.",

Its dialogue-heavy nature and slow-burning narrative will split the audience. Some may find it overly violent and the run-time discouraging. Yet, for those familiar with Tarantino's style, this film builds up to satisfyingly explosive climactic moments, violence served with wry humor and charm.\n\n\"The Hateful Eight\" is a cinematic masterpiece marinated in an essential Tarantino flavor – rich writing, visceral violence, and an unabashed appreciation of cinema.

The soundtrack, while quintessentially 80s, complements the film's tone and enhances the viewing experience.\n\n\"Kickboxer\" may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it is a solid martial arts film that delivers on its promise of action and entertainment. It is a testament to Van Damme's charisma and martial arts skills, and a must-watch for fans of the genre.

The cinematography and editing are top-notch, enhancing the storytelling.\n\n\"Bruce Almighty\" is not just a comedy; it's a film that prompts introspection about our desires and the way we perceive our lives. It's a reminder that the power to change our lives lies within us and not in some external divine intervention.

It's a must-watch for fans of Jim Carrey and for anyone looking for a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.",

    "\"First Man,\" an unsuspecting biographical drama, brilliantly captures the drive and courage of famous astronaut Neil Armstrong. The masterful direction of Damien Chazelle, coupled with the phenomenal performance by Ryan Gosling, brings the first moon landing to life in an astonishingly realistic manner. This movie manages to touch the soul by focusing not just on Armstrong's accomplishments, but also his personal hardships and sacrifices. \n\nEvery facet of Gosling's performance is measured and perfectly calibrated to reflect Armstrong's character. He brilliantly portrays the stoic, composed, and slightly aloof astronaut, yet masterfully allows glimpses of vulnerability and raw emotion to shine through. On the other hand, Claire Foy as Janet Armstrong wonderfully displays raw emotion and strength, depicting the wife of a national hero ever so beautifully.\n\nThe technicalities of the movie are also quite commendable. From the impeccably designed set to the exhilarating special effects - everything breathes authenticity.

Directed by the legendary Billy Wilder, the film is set in a German POW camp during World War II and follows a group of American soldiers trying to root out an informant in their midst.\n\nThe film's strength lies in its well-drawn characters and the performances that bring them to life. William Holden delivers a career-defining performance as Sefton, a cynical, self-interested prisoner who becomes the prime suspect.

The chemistry between the three leads is as strong as ever, and their comedic timing is spot on. Ken Jeong also returns as the eccentric Mr. Chow, and he steals every scene he's in with his over-the-top antics.\n\nThe plot of \"The Hangover Part III\" is more of a straightforward action-comedy than the previous films, which were more mystery-based. This change in formula may not sit well with some fans, but it does allow for some exciting set pieces and hilarious situations. The script is filled with clever one-liners and callbacks to the previous films, which fans will appreciate.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips does a great job of balancing the comedy with the action, and the film is visually impressive, with some great cinematography and editing.

Yet, he maintains ample elements of slapstick humor reminiscent of its predecessors, complementing the seriousness with comic relief.\n\nThe film dives deeper into their personal affinities and conflicts, which is a refreshing change from the usual raucous nature of the franchise. Amid all the chaos and laughs, the emotional dilemma of these characters is touchingly presented, adding a heartening depth to the narrative.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the film somewhat lacks the spark of the original film.

It catered more to plot development and the characters’ evolution, a feat which most comedies rarely venture into.\n\nFans of the franchise might not be entirely pleased as it scrapes off its original formula to stand out as a different version of itself.

    "\"The Machinist\" is a psychological thriller that is as haunting as it is intriguing. Christian Bale delivers a performance that is nothing short of extraordinary, transforming himself physically and emotionally to portray the insomniac machinist, Trevor Reznik. His skeletal appearance and intense portrayal of a man on the brink of madness is both disturbing and captivating.\n\nThe film's narrative is a labyrinth of paranoia, guilt, and obsession, masterfully woven together by director Brad Anderson.

    "One can't discuss science fiction cinema without mentioning Stanley Kubrick's 1968 magnum opus, \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" The film undeniably set a new benchmark for the genre, leaving an enduring impression due to its groundbreaking visual effects, probing narrative, and sublime music.\n\n\"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is an enchanting odyssey through space and time. The visionary storytelling is woven through a series of striking, metaphor-laden vignettes, split into acts capable of standing singularly yet harmoniously connected. It takes the viewer from the dawn of man to the enigmatic star-child conclusion, challenging our concepts of evolution, technology, and extraterrestrial existence. Every viewing offers something new to ponder and interpret, thereby enhancing the inscrutable charm of the film.\n\nThe visual effects, meticulously orchestrated by Kubrick and his groundbreaking team, are still awe-inspiring even by today's advanced CGI standards. \"2001\" is a visual banquet, a feat that traps you in a meditative trance with its balletic spacecraft sequences, mind-bending light-show finale, and vast, silent emptiness of space captured with haunting beauty. \n\nMoreover, Kubrick's masterful attention to detail and realism is commendable. The silent vacuum of space, zero-gravity environment, and hypothesised AI behaviour add to the ambiance and credibility of the portrayed universe. HAL 9000, the malfunctioning computer mainframe, is terrifying in subtle, unexpected ways, proving that the most resonant antagonists are often the most unconventional.\n\nPossibly one of the film's most significant triumphs is its musical score. The ingenious use of classical compositions by Strauss and Ligeti are emotionally stirring and provide an epic, almost spiritual dimension to the film. It's impossible to imagine \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" without its iconic soundtrack, a testament to the critical role of music in audio-visual storytelling.\n\nNonetheless, the film's pace might not appeal to everyone. For audiences used to fast-paced narratives and concrete resolutions, the deliberate, almost poetic pacing, and cryptic story can be disconcerting. Nonetheless, patience and openness to unconventional narrative approaches are rewarded with a deep, philosophical cinema experience. \n\nIn conclusion, \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is more than a film; it's a unique cinematic experience and a thoughtful exploration of humankind's place in the universe. It might not offer the answers to the questions it raises, but perhaps that's the point - to provoke thought, introspection and wonder.",
    "\"The Lost City of Z\" is a breathtaking exploration of obsession, ambition, and man's unending quest for the unknown. This movie stands out amidst modern cinema's heavily CGI-filled productions as it takes a minimalist, but potent approach to storytelling - bringing out raw, unfiltered human emotions against the backdrop of the unexplored Amazon rainforest. \n\nCharlie Hunnam delivers a stellar performance as the driven British explorer, Percy Fawcett, together with an equally impressive supporting cast that includes Robert Pattinson, Sienna Miller, and Tom Holland. Their characters are intricately drawn with profound vulnerabilities and resolve, effectively making the audience invested in their expedition and underlying personal conflicts.\n\nJames Gray's direction is an immersive experience. He wonderfully captures the tantalizing allure and perilous nature of the Amazon rainforest, bringing out the stark contrast between the wild and \"civilized\" society. There's a great deal of respect for the environment, and also for the indigenous cultures portrayed within the film.\n\nThe narrative does not shy away from the socio-political dynamics of the early 20th century, addressing the nuances of pride, power and colonial ambition. This simultaneously complements and complicates Percy Fawcett's quest, adding an ethical dimension that further captivates the viewers.\n\nHowever, the movie's pace may be a tad slow for some viewers, with its runtime coming in at 140 minutes. Although, if viewers were to surrender to its intricacies, they'd find that its deliberate pacing is in service of creating a meditative portrayal of exploration and obsession. \n\nFurthermore, Darius Khondji's cinematography is nothing short of stunning, painting each scene artfully, reflecting the eerie beauty and lurking dangers of the jungle whilst juxtaposing it with the grays of war and polite English society.\n\nThe Lost City of Z serves as a brilliant testament to the exploratory spirit of humans, filled with layers of philosophical, cultural, and ethical dilemmas. It celebrates man's relentless pursuit of the unknown, despite the risk of losing everything. It's a must-watch for fans of real-life adventure portrayals and the drama of human ambition against untamed frontiers.",
    "\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\" is an inventive and absolutely hilarious mockumentary that pushes boundaries of comedy and satire. Sacha Baron Cohen's finesse in completely transforming himself into the character of Borat is staggering to witness. \n\nThe film makes us look at the prejudice, ignorance, and contradictions prevalent in the American society through a non-American's lens. It incorporates situational humor, slapstick, and cringe comedy effectively to elicit laughs but also to make us introspect on the society we live in. Borat's journey, filled with awkward encounters and exploitative scenarios, holds up a mirror to the cultural norms we've come to accept. \n\nThe controversial and provocative aspects of the film are immense, but to dismiss it as pure vulgarity would be doing it a disservice. It takes immense comedic skill to deliver the layers of humor, disgust, and satire found in this film. The interviews and interactions Borat has with 'real' people provide moments that are downright outrageous, yet they delve deeply into the exploration of cultural conflicts and intolerance.\n\nCohen’s comedic genius lies in his ability to evoke genuine reactions from unsuspecting interviewees, unraveling their true thoughts and attitudes, often to their embarrassment. He tests the limits of American politeness and hospitality as they tolerate his character's misogynistic, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic remarks, leading to some of the most uncomfortable yet hilarious scenes in comedy.\n\nThe film is also an effective social commentary. It confronts the audience with the reality of racism, sexism, and classism in a comedic format that's easier to digest than a hard-hitting drama. Borat goes beneath the surface of 'ordinary' American life where behind the laughing facade, glaring issues of prejudice become apparent.\n\nWhile the humour may not be palatable for everyone, the underlying message of tolerance and understanding is universal. The film is brilliantly shot, well-executed, and Cohen flourishes with his eccentric narrative style. \"Borat\" can be understood as a celebration of cultural diversity and a call for a reality check, all while making you laugh uncontrollably. \n\nTo sum up, this film is audacious, surprising, and profoundly funny. It's a comedic masterstroke that deserves accolades for its ingenuity and audacity. Cohen delivers a performance that's memorable for its audacity, poignancy, and the fearless look it provides at the American society beneath the surface.",
    "\"Incendies\" is a cinematic masterpiece that takes its audience on a harrowing journey of discovery, pain, and ultimately, redemption. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film is a testament to his storytelling prowess and his ability to weave complex narratives into a cohesive, compelling whole.\n\nThe film is set in the Middle East, but it transcends geographical boundaries to tell a universal story of human resilience and the indomitable spirit of survival. The narrative is non-linear, oscillating between the past and the present, and this technique adds a layer of intrigue and suspense to the plot.\n\nThe performances in \"Incendies\" are nothing short of phenomenal. Lubna Azabal, who plays Nawal Marwan, delivers a powerful performance that is both heart-wrenching and inspiring. Her portrayal of a woman caught in the throes of a brutal war, and her subsequent quest for truth and justice, is deeply moving. The supporting cast, too, is exceptional, each actor bringing depth and nuance to their respective roles.\n\nThe cinematography of \"Incendies\" is stunning, with each frame meticulously composed to convey the stark realities of war and its aftermath. The film's haunting score further enhances the overall mood and tone, making for an immersive viewing experience.\n\nHowever, what truly sets \"Incendies\" apart is its exploration of themes such as identity, family, and the cyclical nature of violence. The film does not shy away from depicting the horrors of war, but it also underscores the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation in the face of unspeakable atrocities.\n\n\"Incendies\" is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It is a poignant reminder of the human capacity for both cruelty and compassion, and the power of truth to heal even the deepest of wounds. This is not a film for the faint-hearted, but for those willing to embark on this intense emotional journey, \"Incendies\" is a rewarding and unforgettable experience.",
    "\"WALL·E\" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the animation genre, delivering a profound and poignant commentary on society, consumerism, and the environment. The film is set in a dystopian future where Earth has been abandoned due to excessive waste, and the titular character, WALL·E, is a small waste-collecting robot left to clean up the mess. \n\nThe animation is breathtaking, with Pixar's attention to detail creating a visually stunning post-apocalyptic world. The character design is equally impressive, with WALL·E's expressive eyes conveying a depth of emotion that rivals any live-action performance. The film's minimal dialogue emphasizes the power of visual storytelling, with the relationship between WALL·E and EVE unfolding through beautifully animated sequences that are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.\n\nThe film's narrative is a powerful critique of consumer culture and environmental neglect, yet it never feels preachy. Instead, it presents these themes through a compelling story that engages both children and adults. The film's exploration of loneliness, love, and the human condition is deeply moving, and the optimism and perseverance of WALL·E serve as a beacon of hope in the bleak world he inhabits.\n\nThe film's score, composed by Thomas Newman, complements the narrative perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes. The sound design is also noteworthy, with Ben Burtt's work on WALL·E's robotic noises adding a layer of realism to the character.\n\n\"WALL·E\" is a testament to Pixar's ability to create films that are not only visually stunning but also thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. It is a film that challenges, entertains, and ultimately, inspires. It is a must-watch for all ages, a timeless classic that will continue to resonate with audiences for generations to come.",
    "\"Drive\" is a cinematic masterpiece that brilliantly combines elements of action, drama, and romance. The film is a testament to the power of minimalist storytelling, with its sparse dialogue and emphasis on visual storytelling. Ryan Gosling delivers a stellar performance as the enigmatic protagonist, a stunt driver by day and a getaway driver by night. His nuanced portrayal of a man of few words but many secrets is truly captivating.\n\nThe film's narrative is a slow-burning fuse that leads to an explosive climax.

The plot is not driven by dialogue but by the actions and reactions of the characters, making every glance and gesture significant.\n\nThe cinematography is another standout aspect of \"Drive\". The neon-lit streets of Los Angeles serve as a vibrant backdrop to the film's dark narrative. The camera work is both stylish and purposeful, with each shot meticulously composed to enhance the storytelling.\n\nThe soundtrack, a mix of synth-pop and ambient music, complements the film's aesthetic perfectly. It sets the mood and enhances the overall viewing experience. The director, Nicolas Winding Refn, uses music and sound design effectively to heighten the tension and drama.\n\n\"Drive\" is not your typical action movie.

Additionally, the introduction of Dark Elves, led by Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston, adds a new mystical layer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, even though the villain isn't as well developed as some other antagonists in MCU.\n\nTechnically, \"Thor: The Dark World\" impresses with its stunning visuals and spectacular set pieces. The combined realms of Asgard and Earth is a key highlight, with production design on a grand, epic scale. The climax, with the convergence phenomenon, is an action feast for fans.\n\nOn the downside, the film does suffer from a problem of pacing, especially in its earlier parts. While the humor is welcomed and works well in some parts, it occasionally undercuts the gravitas of certain situations, decreasing the perceived stakes of the plot. \n\nOverall, \"Thor: The Dark World\", though not perfect, is a worthwhile entrant into the MCU. It offers a decent story, packed with action, humor, and emotion, engaging our interest in the universe's larger narrative. It's a must-watch for any Thor or Marvel fan.",
    "\"Me Before You\" is a beautifully executed romantic drama that leaves an indelible imprint on one's psyche. Based on Jojo Moyes' bestselling novel, the film stunningly explores the resilience of the human spirit in a uniquely bittersweet way.\n\nEmilia Clarke, known for her role as Daenerys Targaryen in \"Game of Thrones\", demonstrates her versatility in her vibrant portrayal of Louisa Clark, the cheery albeit quirky small-town girl tasked with caring for Will Traynor, played by Sam Claflin. Claflin, famous for his role as Finnick Odair in \"Hunger Games\", expertly exhibits a cynicism and desolation that could only stem from a life drastically changed by a disabling accident. The pair craft an unconventional and touching love story that evolves very naturally before your eyes.\n\nThe film manages to address the complex theme of assisted suicide with a delicate subtlety, while seamlessly exploring the intricacies of class and familial tensions in modern Britain. The filmmakers have been careful to not make the entire movie about Will's disability but rather about the couple’s burgeoning love and the broadening of their respective life perspectives.\n\nMoreover, the movie is visually captivating with picturesque locations and complimentary color palettes, creating an aesthetic as compelling as the narrative. The director, Thea Sharrock, skillfully draws out heartfelt performances so much that by the end, you will be hard-pressed to keep your eyes dry.\n\nOn another note, Janet McTeer delivers a commendable, nuanced portrayal as Traynor's mother while Charles Dance impresses as his emotionally distanced father.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its faults. \"Me Before You\" occasionally risks tipping into melodrama and its gazes into the disabled life might be seen as superficial. Yet, the emotional resonance of the film as a love story, its sensitive handling of the conflicting emotions around disability and assisted dying, as well as its ability to smile in the face of despair, make it a rewarding watch. Despite its heartbreaking conclusion, the movie manages to end on an invigorating note, which encapsulates the film's message about the importance of living life fully and fearlessly.",
    "\"Yes Man\" captivates the audience with its infectious optimism and winsome performances. The film is famously known for the brilliant and wildly entertaining portrayal of Carl Allen by the incomparable Jim Carrey. Carrey yet again delivers a genuinely hilarious yet surprisingly emotional performance. The narrative takes you into a whirlwind of comedic adventures as Carl embarks on a journey to transform his life by saying 'yes' to everything. \n\nThe plot uses a simple and almost absurd premise to elaborate on the complexities of life decisions. It explores and exploits its concept, driving the plot from one unexpected situation to another, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats with laughter. However, beneath the comedic antics, there are thoughtful undertones about the power of opportunity, the potential in taking chances, and navigating through the inevitable chaos of life. \n\nZooey Deschanel's performance as Allison gives the story a shot of whimsical charm and indie flair. Her chemistry with Carrey is palpable and their relationship adds a layer of sweetness and solace that prevent the movie's concept from becoming overwhelming. Her portrayal as a free-spirited woman draws out another dimension into the narrative - that life is not just about saying 'yes', but also about saying 'yes' to the right things.\n\nThe supporting cast, which includes Bradley Cooper and Rhys Darby, also contributes significantly to the humor, bringing their distinct personalities and comic timings to the fore. The screenplay is packed with quirky, hearty, and memorable lines that you'll find yourself quoting long after the movie has ended.\n\nWhile the film is big on laughs, it is equally big on heart. From directing to acting, every element of \"Yes Man\" comes together to create an uplifting cocktail of humor and life lessons. It will make you laugh out loud, and will also subtly encourage you to open yourself up to new experiences and opportunities. You leave this film with a sense of warm satisfaction and just maybe, a readiness to say 'yes' a little more in your life.",
    "\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" is an extraordinarily insightful coming-of-age film that presents a poignant exploration of adolescence. The brilliant screenplay, based on Stephen Chbosky's bestselling novel, beautifully expresses the trials of growing up, mental health, love, and friendship.\n\nThe movie remarkably captures the high school experience with a balance of poignancy and humor, something many attempts at such films fail to achieve. The vivid cinematic style and authentic dialogue are absolutely captivating. One walks away from this movie truly understanding and sympathizing with the complexity of the characters.\n\nLogan Lerman's sensitive and sincere portrayal of the protagonist, Charlie, is nothing short of exceptional. He perfectly captures the sensitivity, imagination, and quiet strength of his character. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller also give moving performances as the supportive and dynamic friends who help Charlie navigate his high school years. The brilliant performances by these actors truly breathe life to their complex roles, making their experiences and emotions deeply resonate with audiences.\n\nThe film's ending is particularly stirring, creating a rollercoaster of emotions that will leave you thinking and processing for days. The thought-provoking themes regarding mental health and trauma are portrayed tactfully and honestly, and it’s this raw emotional honesty that sets the movie apart.\n\nThe soundtrack of the movie deserves a special mention. It notably enhances the storytelling, with every song seeming to fit flawlessly with each frame, every sequence. Indie-rock anthems mixed with classic tunes take you down the memory lane, enhancing the nostalgic sense this movie emanates.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" is much more than your regular teen flick. It's a triumph of skillful storytelling, superb acting, and powerful direction that tackles a complex narrative. Whether you're a teenager or simply young at heart, this film will touch you, make you think, and speak to your soul in ways very few films can. Truly, a must-watch movie.",
    "\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is a magical journey that transports viewers into a world of enchantment and wonder. The film, based on J.K. Rowling's beloved novel, is a masterful adaptation that remains faithful to its source material while also offering its own unique cinematic charm.\n\nThe casting is spot-on, with Daniel Radcliffe delivering a commendable performance as the titular character, Harry Potter. His portrayal of the young wizard, who is just discovering his magical heritage, is both endearing and believable. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who play Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley respectively, also shine in their roles, providing both humor and heart.\n\nThe film's visual effects are nothing short of spectacular. The Quidditch match, the moving staircases of Hogwarts, and the life-like game of wizard's chess are all brought to life in a way that is both awe-inspiring and faithful to the descriptions in the book. The film's score, composed by the legendary John Williams, further enhances the magical atmosphere with its enchanting melodies.\n\nThe plot, while primarily aimed at a younger audience, is engaging and filled with enough twists and turns to keep viewers of all ages hooked. The film does an excellent job of setting up the larger narrative of the Harry Potter series, introducing key characters and concepts, while also delivering a satisfying standalone story.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its flaws. Some may find the pacing a bit slow, particularly in the first half. Additionally, some of the dialogue can come across as stilted and the performances of the child actors, while generally good, can occasionally feel a bit forced.\n\nDespite these minor issues, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is a delightful film that serves as a fantastic introduction to the world of Harry Potter. It captures the magic and wonder of the books while also offering a visually stunning cinematic experience. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer to the wizarding world, this film is sure to enchant and entertain.",
    "\"Alien: Covenant\" is a thrilling addition to the Alien franchise, masterfully directed by Ridley Scott.

The narrative is well-paced, with a good balance of action, horror, and character development. The script is well-written, with dialogue that is both realistic and thought-provoking.\n\nThe performances in \"Alien: Covenant\" are top-notch.

Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, and Danny McBride also deliver strong performances, bringing depth and complexity to their characters.\n\nThe visual effects in \"Alien: Covenant\" are stunning. The alien creatures are terrifyingly realistic, and the film's depiction of outer space is breathtaking. The cinematography is excellent, with a dark and moody aesthetic that perfectly complements the film's tone.\n\nThe film's score, composed by Jed Kurzel, is haunting and atmospheric, adding to the overall sense of dread and tension. The sound design is also noteworthy, with every growl, hiss, and scream of the alien creatures sounding chillingly real.\n\n\"Alien: Covenant\" is not without its flaws. Some of the characters are underdeveloped, and certain plot points are left unresolved. However, these issues do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Alien: Covenant\" is a worthy entry in the Alien franchise. It delivers on the promise of its premise, offering a thrilling and terrifying cinematic experience. Fans of the franchise, as well as newcomers, will find much to enjoy in this film.",
    "\"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\" serves as the pinnacle of George Lucas' prequels, building off its predecessors to offer a visually gripping and emotionally charged final installment. The central drama of Anakin Skywalker's momentous fall to the dark side and the larger bustling background of interstellar war merge seamlessly into a cohesive and compelling narrative.\n\nHayden Christensen delivers an all-consuming performance as the Jedi Anakin Skywalker, exquisitely capturing his character's internal struggles and gradual tilt towards the dark side. Ewan McGregor, in his reprisal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, provides the emotional bedrock of the film, masterfully shouldering his character's grief and betrayal. Together, their climactic lightsaber duel is one of the franchise's most emotionally potent and spectacularly choreographed sequences.\n\nLucas' strategic use of CGI is commendable, adorning the film with some awe-inspiring landscapes and futuristic cityscapes. Despite some blemishes in the dialogue, largely embedded in Lucas' famed expository style, the emotive performances of the cast transcend these minor hurdles and inject a much-needed humanity into this grand space opera.\n\nJohn Williams elevates the film with his iconic score, beautifully underscoring the spectacular action sequences and the poignant character dialogues. His music remains one of the irrefutable anchors that continues to bind this franchise together and resonate with audiences across generations. \n\nIn essence, \"Revenge of the Sith\" may not be perfect, but it fittingly encapsulates the tragedy, grandeur, and pathos that characterize the Star Wars franchise. Notwithstanding the film's occasional cliches, it is an impactful conclusion to the prequel series that further enriches Lucas' expansive galaxy far, far away.",
    "\"X-Men: Apocalypse\" is a paradoxically ambitious yet underwhelming spectacle, adding significantly to its universe but sadly missing the mark on delivery. It gathers together old favorites and introduces new characters in a wide-sweeping attempt to expand the X-Men saga. Characters like Professor X, Mystique, and Magneto continue their trajectories with nuanced performances that remind us why we’ve grown attached to them, while the new additions of Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Nightcrawler enhance the dynamic. \n\nApocalypse, the primary antagonist, played hauntingly by Oscar Isaac, is seemingly invincible, thereby imposing an appropriate sense of dread and tension throughout the movie. Nevertheless, the exploration of his character lacks depth and doesn't fully draw out Isaac's acting prowess.\n\nAs for the narrative, it’s a wide-scale destruction fantasy that, at times, may make viewers long for something a little more focused and personal. The film grapples with intense themes of genocide, God complexes, and weaponized religions, though they're not entirely explored or addressed in a satisfying way.\n\nDirector Bryan Singer’s visual spectacle is certainly admirable. With a cataclysmic scope, the CGI sequences are world-shattering and grand, although sometimes overly drawn out. The manipulation of time, space, and mass generates eye-watering chaotic battles amidst over-the-top decay and devastation. \n\nQuicksilver steals the spotlight once again with a masterfully crafted scene that induces laughter amidst the impending doom, proving to be a radiant beam of light amongst the darkness. Overall, the performances from the ensemble cast are generally commendable. They ably portray their respective characters with the gravity and sincerity that the narrative dictates.\n\nThe bone of contention with \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" is the attempt to cram an overabundance of characters, subplots, and concepts into a single movie. This sadly results in an inconsistent pace, lack of character development and a smudged understanding of the plot. \n\nUltimately, whilst \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" serves as an entertaining visual thrill ride, it pales in comparison to its predecessors due to its sprawling nature and lack of focus. Regardless, die-hard fans of the franchise might still find some enjoyment in these familiar characters inhabiting a world at the brink of annihilation.",
    "\"Footloose\" is an iconic embodiment of the 80s American culture in film form. While one might dismiss it as just another teen-centric movie, it goes beyond the surface level, delving into the realm of societal norms and public censorship. It is a movie that convinces you slowly but surely of the natural human necessity for freedom of expression, which in this specific case is expressed through dance.\n\nKevin Bacon has managed to fill the shoes of the rebel Ren McCormack with incredible finesse. His enthusiasm is infectious as he brings life to the sleepy, repressed town of Bomont. Bacon's snappy dialogue, youthful charisma and impressive dance moves truly make his character memorable. Furthermore, Lori Singer, as Ariel Moore, splendidly portrays a character that is torn between her childhood faith and the longing for independence. Both their performances are supported by an extraordinary cast that includes the likes of John Lithgow and Dianne West.\n\nOne can't review \"Footloose\" without talking about its soundtrack. It features songs that have now become anthems of the 80s - from Kenny Loggins' energetic self-titled track, to moving tunes like \"Let's Hear It For The Boy\". This exceptional blend of music and dance sequences infuses energy into the narrative, making it a cinematic experience to remember.\n\nThe heart of \"Footloose\", however, is its thematic symbolism - the rebellious youth challenging antiquated norms. Even though it’s wrapped around the allure of teen romance and catchy music, the fabric of the story is a critique on over-the-top conservatism. Director Herbert Ross, resists the temptation of limiting this movie as a superficial teen drama, and subtly crafts a commentary on freedom, expression, individuality and rebellion.\n\nHowever, the movie does at times feel a bit over-dramatized, and some plot points seem a tad unrealistic. Yet, these are easy to overlook when you consider the film's overarching plea for personal and societal liberation.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Footloose\" is a vibrant, entertaining romp that is both a nostalgic nod to the 80s and a timeless call for freedom. Despite its occasional flaws, it remains a dance film worth watching and re-watching.",

    "\"Lucky Number Slevin\" is a smart, stylish crime thriller that combines wry humor, sleek visuals and slick dialogue to create a highly entertaining cinematic experience. Propelled by a captivating mystery, the movie's unique and complex narrative structure continuously keeps the audience second-guessing about the true nature of its characters and their motivations. \n\nIn a genre that is often filled with clichéd characters, \"Lucky Number Slevin\" stands out with its assembly of unique, deeply layered personas. Josh Hartnett crafts an exceptional performance as Slevin, bringing a mix of charm and nonchalance that makes his character admittedly engrossing.

Written by Jason Smilovic, the dialogue is smart, snappy and saturated with humour that beautifully lightens the intense mood. References to old detective novels and classic noir intrigue envelops the story, creating nostalgic resonations.\n\nOne of the integral attractions of the movie is its elegant visual treatment. The use of pastel colours, stylized sets, and unconventional framings lend a distinct aesthetic appeal that underlines the movie's artistic vision.\n\nBut \"Lucky Number Slevin\" isn't without its downsides. The plot can get slightly convoluted, and the non-stop twists may baffle some viewers. Yet, the denouement is worth the effort as everything falls into place spectacularly. \n\nOverall, \"Lucky Number Slevin\" manages to traverse the delicate line between a savvy crime thriller and a witty black comedy – making it a must-watch for genre lovers.

The cinematography is stunning, with every frame meticulously crafted to enhance the storytelling. The production design and the use of symbolism are noteworthy, contributing to the overall mood and tone of the film.\n\n\"Parasite\" is a testament to Bong Joon-ho's prowess as a filmmaker. His ability to weave a complex narrative with social relevance into an entertaining film is commendable. The film's universal appeal lies in its ability to resonate with audiences globally, despite its distinct cultural context.\n\nThe film's ending leaves a lasting impact, forcing viewers to reflect on the societal issues it presents. \"Parasite\" is not just a film, but an experience that challenges conventional storytelling and pushes the boundaries of cinema. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates thought-provoking and well-crafted cinema.",
    "\"This is The End\" is an anything-goes apocalyptic raucous comedy with a plethora of Hollywood stars. As one of the most hysterically funny films I've seen in a while, this movie is infused with genuine laughs from start to finish. Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson - all play skewed versions of themselves to comedic perfection. \n\nThe story invites us to a wild party at James Franco's house where celebrities are reveling hard not realizing that the apocalypse is about to happen. What follows is a relentless journey of wit, surprises, and extensive comedy. The comic timing of the ensemble cast is truly impressive and their performances are just as hilarious and outrageous as one might expect.\n\nThe script does not shy away from vulgarity and it even pushes the envelope of crude humor for many. However, the crassness only adds to the hilarity of the situations. The premise of the film is outlandishly absurd yet brilliant. \"This is The End\" successfully blurs the line between reality and fiction, using the real personas of the actors to create a fun mockery of Hollywood's excesses.\n\nThe unexpected cameo appearances are sure to delight viewers, adding another dimension to the fun. Add to that some brilliantly crafted CGI sequences involving a certain dark lord for a visually impressive treat.\n\nWhile on one hand, it has an unashamedly ridiculous plot, on the other it provides social commentary through its comedy by addressing the rampant egotism in Hollywood and our society's obsession with fame.\n\nTrue, \"This is The End\" might not be everyone's cup of tea due to its bawdy humor and controversial religious themes. However, the movie is funny consistently at a rate that puts other comedies to shame.

    "\"Windtalkers\" is a war film that delves into a lesser-known aspect of World War II - the use of Navajo code talkers. Directed by John Woo, the film is a blend of intense action sequences and emotional drama, offering a unique perspective on the war.\n\nNicolas Cage delivers a powerful performance as Sergeant Joe Enders, a man burdened with the responsibility of protecting the code at all costs. His complex relationship with Private Ben Yahzee, played by Adam Beach, forms the crux of the movie. Beach's portrayal of Yahzee is commendable, bringing to life the character's courage, intelligence, and cultural pride.\n\nThe film's action sequences are well-executed, with Woo's signature style evident in the slow-motion shots and close-up combat scenes. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the harsh realities of war and the beautiful landscapes of the Navajo homeland.\n\nHowever, \"Windtalkers\" falls short in its exploration of the Navajo culture and the code talkers' contributions to the war. The film focuses more on Cage's character, relegating the code talkers to supporting roles. This is a missed opportunity, as the unique premise of the Navajo code talkers could have been explored in greater depth.\n\nThe film's depiction of war is brutal and unflinching, but it sometimes veers into melodrama. The subplot involving Enders' love interest feels unnecessary and detracts from the main narrative.\n\nDespite its flaws, \"Windtalkers\" is a compelling war film that sheds light on a fascinating aspect of World War II. The performances are strong, the action is thrilling, and the story, while not fully realized, is intriguing. It's a worthy watch for war film enthusiasts and history buffs.",

    "The Wolf of Wall Street is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the true story of Jordan Belfort – magnificently portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio – a stockbroker whose fraudulent practices led to his downfall. \n\nDirector Martin Scorsese displays his filmmaking prowess in this over-the-top depiction of Belfort's life of debauchery, greed, and unfathomable wealth. The film presents a fast-paced, manic energy that suits Belfort's lifestyle, highlighting the pervasive corruption in 1980s Wall Street, yet never losing sight of the inherently pitiable state of its key players. \n\nDiCaprio truly shines, delivering one of the best performances of his career. He brilliantly captures the complexities of Belfort – his charisma, intelligence, audacity, and underlying emptiness. Future generations of actors could take notes on DiCaprio's commitment to the character and his immersive performance.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally impressive, with Jonah Hill's Donnie Azoff standing out with his delightful, hilarious, but equally tragic performance. Margot Robbie, as Belfort's wife, showcases her talent and versatility in the role of a woman caught in the wild ride, offering a profound portrayal of glamour laced with despair.\n\nThe movie calls upon an interesting blend of humor and drama, providing amusement whilst underlining the grim reality of the story. Its audacious, at times shocking, depiction of Wall Street shenanigans is a testament to Scorsese’s daring filmmaking style. Though some scenes border on the absurd, they perfectly echo the story's overall theme of excess.\n\nHowever, The Wolf of Wall Street is not a film for the faint-hearted. Clocking in at three hours, the exhilarating ride it offers is punctuated by explicit content and instances of vulgarity, which may unsettle certain viewers. \n\nIn spite of this, the film is an eye-opening exploration of decadence, deception, and the toll the relentless pursuit of wealth can have on the human soul.

Do invest with caution, though —like its dubious protagonists, this movie can be both wildly intoxicating and unsettling in almost equal measure.",
    "\"The Hurricane\" is a powerful and emotionally charged film that tells the true story of Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, a boxer wrongfully accused and convicted of murder. Denzel Washington delivers a stellar performance as Carter, embodying the character's strength, resilience, and determination with such conviction that it's impossible not to be moved. His portrayal is both raw and nuanced, capturing the essence of a man who refuses to be broken by a system that is stacked against him.\n\nThe narrative is well-structured, seamlessly weaving between Carter's past and present, his boxing career, and his fight for justice. The script is sharp and poignant, never shying away from the harsh realities of racial prejudice and corruption within the justice system. Yet, it also highlights the power of hope, friendship, and the human spirit.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Vicellous Reon Shannon as Lesra Martin, the young man who becomes instrumental in Carter's quest for justice, is equally impressive.

    "The Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film - a stirring tale of hope, friendship, and triumph of the human spirit embedded within the desolate confines of a maximum-security prison. It touches on themes that are timeless, and perhaps more relevant in our current state than when the movie was made.\n\nThe film masterfully captures the transformation of our protagonist, Andy Dufresne, played phenomenally by Tim Robbins. From a quiet banker framed for his wife's murder to an inspiring beacon of hope in the darkest corners of the Shawshank State Penitentiary, his character's journey is intriguing and captivating. \n\nMorgan Freeman is equally impressive as the seasoned inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding, whose narration adds depth and perspective to the story. The chemistry between these two characters and how their friendship unfolds over the dehumanising atmosphere of the prison is a compelling plot element. \n\nFrank Darabont's direction in this film is exceptional. The way he uses the cinematic tools at his disposal to create an oppressive prison atmosphere and contrast it with symbols of hope and freedom makes for a visually powerful movie. Thomas Newman's score envelopes the film in a cocoon of melancholic melancholy, playing into the narrative seamlessly. \n\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" isn't an easy film to watch, and it's meant to be that way. It gives audiences a grim depiction of the prison system, and yet, amidst the harsh realities it portrays, the film also promises a beacon of hope. It assures us that even in the grimmest circumstances, there can be friendship and dreams unbroken. \n\nThe ending of the film, without giving away any spoilers, strikes a perfect balance of satisfaction and joy for the viewer. It concludes an intense narrative journey with an emotionally fulfilling resolution, leaving a profound impact that lingered long after the credits rolled.\n\nIn essence, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a timeless classic that reminds us all that hope can pull us through the darkest times and that redemption is possible for everyone. It certainly deserves its status as one of the greatest movies ever made.",
    "\"Scary Movie 2\", the sequel to the hit horror parody, is an incredibly raucous and often times hilariously absurd film that brilliantly pokes fun at a various collection of horror films including \"The Exorcist\" and \"Hollow Man\" to name a few.\n\nThe humour in \"Scary Movie 2\" isn't for everyone, but the completely over-the-top and ridiculous comedy style of the Wayans brothers is what makes it charming. The ensemble cast, featuring Anna Faris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans and several others, perform admirably in their roles - all bringing an animated charisma that complements the ludicrous on-screen scenarios.\n\nWhile the plot of \"Scary Movie 2\" is a bit senseless (but then again, it's not meant to be a serious movie), the pace keeps the audience's interest alive with its non-stop wave of laugh-out-loud moments. The parodies and cultural references embedded within the film are pure genius, and watching the movie more than once helps unravel even more of these comedic gems.\n\nAlthough the level of comedy in this movie is pretty coarse and crude, it definitely has its own charm. The gross-out humour might be off-putting for some, but it's a crucial element that shapes the unique identity of the \"Scary Movie\" franchise.\n\nThe visual effects might not be ground-breaking but remember, this is a mockery film that doesn't require the gloss and glamour of high-end production. In fact, the semi-cheap aesthetics somehow add another layer of comedy to the overall viewing experience.\n\nOverall, if you’re a fan of slapstick and outrageously crude comedy or a lover of horror movie parodies, then \"Scary Movie 2\" is definitely a must-watch film. Obviously, this isn't a movie meant to move hearts or provoke profound thoughts. Rather, it's a wild, raucous ride meant purely for laughs, and in that, it delivers in spades.",
    "The live-action adaptation of \"Aladdin\" is an enchanting spectacle that revives the magic of the 1992 Disney classic. Director Guy Ritchie retains the spirit of the original, while also adding his unique flair to it. The vibrant cinematography captivates, transporting viewers into the colourful and bustling streets of Agrabah. \n\nThe casting is superb, with Mena Massoud breathing fresh life into the character of Aladdin. His performance strikes the perfect balance between boyish charm and charismatic hero. Naomi Scott is equally impressive as Princess Jasmine, infusing her character with a fiery independence that feels both modern and true to the spirit of the original. Will Smith charms with his own interpretation of the Genie, fulfilling the large shoes left by the late Robin Williams while also adding his personal touch. The rest of the cast, although not as prominent, play their parts to perfection.\n\nThe music, one of the highlights of the original, is treated with great respect in this adaptation. Classics like \"A Whole New World\" and \"Friend Like Me\" take you back, while the new original song \"Speechless\" performed by Naomi Scott, is a worthy addition to the soundtrack.\n\nThe plot remains relatively faithful to the animated film, but the few changes made, far from diluting the magic, instead provide depth, particularly in exploring the motivations of Jafar and the aspirations of Jasmine.\n\nDespite these merits, the film is not without its flaws. The pacing can feel rushed at times, and the CGI, while generally excellent, can occasionally detract rather than add to the viewing experience.\n\nHowever, these minor drawbacks don't significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. In the end, \"Aladdin\" is a visually stunning, superbly acted and splendidly musical trip down memory lane that still feels fresh and new. Recommended for both fans of the original and newcomers alike, this is a dazzling magic carpet ride that’s certainly worth hopping on.",
    "\"Bloody Sunday\" is a harrowing and deeply moving portrayal of one of the darkest days in Northern Ireland's history. Directed by Paul Greengrass, the film is a stark, unflinching look at the events of January 30, 1972, when British soldiers opened fire on a peaceful civil rights march in Derry, resulting in the deaths of 14 innocent people.\n\nThe film's strength lies in its raw, documentary-style approach. Greengrass employs handheld cameras and naturalistic lighting to create a sense of immediacy and realism that is both gripping and unsettling. The chaos and confusion of the day are captured with an intensity that is palpable, making the viewer feel as if they are right there in the midst of the turmoil.\n\nThe performances are uniformly excellent, with James Nesbitt delivering a standout performance as Ivan Cooper, the Member of Parliament who organized the ill-fated march. Nesbitt's portrayal of Cooper is deeply human and nuanced, capturing the man's idealism, frustration, and ultimately, his despair.\n\n\"Bloody Sunday\" does not shy away from the brutality of the events it depicts. The scenes of violence are shocking in their realism, but they are never gratuitous. Instead, they serve to underscore the senseless tragedy of the day and the profound injustice that was done.\n\nThe film also does an admirable job of presenting a balanced view of the events. While it is clear where Greengrass's sympathies lie, he does not demonize the British soldiers. Instead, he portrays them as young, scared men who were ill-prepared for the situation they found themselves in.\n\n\"Bloody Sunday\" is a powerful, thought-provoking film that serves as a stark reminder of a tragic event in history. It is a testament to the power of cinema to illuminate the past and provoke discussion about the present. It is not an easy watch, but it is an important one.",
    "\"Ford v Ferrari\" is an exhilarating cinematic tour de force that manages to insert viewers directly into the high-speed world of racing while also seamlessly combining elements of drama, friendship, and corporate rivalry into the mix. The movie is based on the fascinating, real-life saga of Ford's attempt to dethrone Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France, a true event that is portrayed here with remarkable accuracy and heart-stopping intensity.\n\nThe shining stars of this film are undoubtedly Christian Bale and Matt Damon, who brilliantly portray race car driver Ken Miles and car designer Carroll Shelby, respectively. Bale's performance as the stubborn yet skilled driver is extraordinary - his psychological insight into the character, attesting to the thrilling nature of the sport and the personal sacrifices it demands, is worthy of an Oscar nod. Meanwhile, Damon provides an equally compelling performance as the innovative Shelby, showing nuanced layers of the man behind the ambitious vision that fuelled Ford's groundbreaking endeavor.\n\nThe thrilling race sequences in the film are shot in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, demonstrating an excellent work by the film's director James Mangold. Mangold's attention to atmospheric details and immersion within the races is nothing short of exceptional and adds unparalleled authenticity to the viewing experience.\n\nHowever, \"Ford v Ferrari\" is not only about racing. One of its greatest strengths is how it delves deep into the corporate politics of both Ford and Ferrari, showcasing the individual motivations and passionate struggles of those involved. A particularly commendable aspect is the movie’s emphasis on the crucial bond of friendship between Miles and Shelby. The film gives as much weightage to their ups and downs, as it does to the spectacular racing sequences.\n\nThe vibrant cinematography, energetic race sequences, balanced narrative, and stellar performances all round set \"Ford v Ferrari\" apart from many other sports dramas.

    "\"The Football Factory\" is a raw, gritty, and unflinching look at the world of football hooliganism in the UK. The film, directed by Nick Love, is a brutal exploration of the culture that surrounds the beautiful game, far removed from the glitz and glamour of the Premier League.\n\nThe film's protagonist, Tommy Johnson, played with a fierce intensity by Danny Dyer, is a disillusioned twenty-something who finds meaning and camaraderie in the violent tribalism of football hooliganism. Dyer's performance is both compelling and disturbing, as he fully immerses himself into the role, bringing a sense of authenticity and realism to the character.\n\nThe narrative is unapologetically brutal, filled with graphic violence and coarse language, which may not be to everyone's taste. However, it is this unfiltered portrayal of hooliganism that makes \"The Football Factory\" stand out. It doesn't glorify or romanticize the violence, but rather presents it as a grim reality of this subculture.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Frank Harper and Tamer Hassan, deliver strong performances, adding depth to the narrative. The cinematography is gritty and the soundtrack, filled with pulsating beats, complements the film's intense atmosphere.\n\nHowever, \"The Football Factory\" is not just about football hooliganism. It also delves into themes of masculinity, identity, and social class, offering a critique of a society that leaves individuals like Tommy feeling marginalized and directionless.\n\nWhile the film's graphic content may be off-putting for some, \"The Football Factory\" is a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of a dark side of football culture that is often overlooked. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, forcing you to confront the uncomfortable realities it presents.",
    "\"Jojo Rabbit\" is a bold and audacious attempt at satirizing one of the darkest phases in human history. Directed by the masterful Taika Waititi, who also plays the ludicrously juvenile version of Adolf Hitler, the movie is a perfect blend of comedy, drama, and war-based storytelling.\n\nRoman Griffin Davis, in the role of the young boy Jojo, delivers an astonishingly well-layered performance. He portrays a Hitler youth undergoing a journey of enlightenment with a maturity and understanding that is beyond his years. Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother elegantly unfolds the counter narrative, highlighting the humanity extinguishing under the Nazi regime. The loving mother subtly challenging her son's indoctrinated beliefs is executed with sensitivity.\n\nThe rather lighthearted approach to such a serious subject matter may not sit well with all viewers; however, the unique blend of satire and emotional depth produces an engaging narrative. The screenplay manages to extract humor from the quirkiest of situations, which is a testament to Waititi's vibrant writing that doesn't shy away from showcasing the brutality of war against the backdrop of a child's vibrant imagination.\n\nWaititi masterfully guides the tone shifts throughout the film, alternating between comedy-driven sequences and genuinely heartbreaking moments. Credit is due to the outstanding cinematography that stunningly captures the beauty and chaos of war-torn Germany. \n\n\"Jojo Rabbit\" triumphantly satirizes the grotesque fanatical ideology of Nazi Germany while celebrating the resilience and courage of human spirit. It utilizes the medium of satirical dark comedy in delivering an important message about love, tolerance, and humanity.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Jojo Rabbit\" is not merely a cinematic experience but also a journey of emotional transformation that takes the viewer through laughter, tears, and ultimately, thought. It is an audacious, yet affectionate quest for the essence of humanity in the darkest of times, making it a must-watch.",
    "\"Shall We Dance,\" a delightful romantic comedy drama, spins a fascinating tale of love, life, transformation and dance. It strikes a poignant chord, combining the joy of dance with a midlife crisis narrative.\n\nThe heart of the movie surrounds Richard Gere, an exceptional performer who brings gravitas to his role as a bored, lonely lawyer who finds solace in ballroom dancing.

This film encourages viewers to embrace their passions, breaking away from societal norms and finding happiness in the most unexpected places.\n\nDespite a few moments of predictability, \"Shall We Dance\" is delightful and charming, enchanting audiences with its heart, humor, outstanding performances, and immersive dance scenes. It may not be a hardcore dance film, but it offers a heartwarming story that sticks with you, making it worth the watch.",
    "\"Coyote Ugly\" is a film that is both entertaining and inspiring, with a storyline that is as engaging as it is heartwarming.

The songs, especially \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\", have a way of sticking with you long after the movie ends.\n\n\"Coyote Ugly\" also excels in its depiction of the bar, which is almost a character in itself. The bar scenes are energetic and lively, capturing the wild and free spirit of the place. The choreography in these scenes is impressive, making the bar scenes some of the most memorable parts of the film.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its flaws. The plot can be predictable at times, and some of the characters lack depth. Despite these shortcomings, \"Coyote Ugly\" is still an enjoyable watch.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Coyote Ugly\" is a feel-good movie that combines drama, comedy, and music in a way that is sure to entertain. While it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, it is a fun film that leaves you with a smile on your face.",

Hutton, is set during World War II and follows a group of American soldiers who discover a secret stash of Nazi gold and set out to steal it.\n\nThe ensemble cast, led by Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, and Donald Sutherland, is truly exceptional. Eastwood, as Private Kelly, brings his trademark coolness and charisma to the role, while Savalas, as Master Sergeant Big Joe, provides a perfect balance of gruffness and humor. However, it's Sutherland who steals the show as the eccentric tank commander, Oddball. His performance is both hilarious and endearing, making him a standout character in a film full of memorable roles.\n\nThe script, penned by Troy Kennedy-Martin, is sharp and witty, filled with memorable one-liners and clever dialogue.

Directed by American film titan Oliver Stone, this film is a charged outlook on the infamous assassination of John F Kennedy - an event that left America and the world in shock.\n\n\"JFK\" presents a highly controversial, yet thoroughly hypnotic tapestry of theories, conjectures and details associated with the occurrences leading up to and beyond the assassination. Stone, known for his prowess in depicting the political climate of America, vividly brings to life New Orleans DA - Jim Garrison’s scrutiny into Kennedy's murder. Garrison, played by Academy Award Winner, Kevin Costner, delivers a nuanced and captivating performance, making the audience sink further into the labyrinth of conspiracy theories. \n\nStone's filmmaking is the real tour de force as he skilfully blends fictionalized aspects with historical facts. His narrative integration of the much-argued Zapruder Footage, depicting the assassination, contributes to the intriguing and suspenseful atmosphere of the film. The cinematography is gritty and definitive, contributing to the 60's rustic feel of the narrative. The fast-paced editing keeps viewers on their toes, intensifying the mystery surrounding JFK’s assassination. \n\nThe ensemble cast including Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, and Sissy Spacek further elevate the experience, delivering memorable performances that resonate with the audience long after the credits roll.

    "\"From Dusk Till Dawn\" is an anarchy-filled joyride that combines elements of road-trip flicks, crime capers, vampire movies, and 70's grindhouse into one memorable film. Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino, their collaborative passion for over-the-top characters, dialogue, and bloodshed is evident throughout.\n\nThe film starts as an explosive crime thriller, following the unpredictable Gecko brothers (played by George Clooney and Tarantino himself), two fugitives blazing a trail towards the Mexican border. Clooney delivers a charismatic performance as the level-headed outlaw struggling to control his volatile brother. Tarantino, on the other hand, spins a chilling performance as a sociopath.\n\nTheir journey takes an unexpected left turn when they cross paths with a family of faith-challenged characters traveling in a motor home portrayed brilliantly by Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, and Ernest Liu. When both groups converge at an isolated bar, the movie suddenly switches gears and plunges headlong into sheer vampire horror. This abrupt shift from crime saga to supernatural story may disorient some viewers, but for those who appreciate the art of genre-mixing, it is a refreshing change of pace.\n\nFeaturing a colorful cast of characters including Cheech Marin in multiple roles, Salma Hayek as the seductive vampire queen, and Tom Savini as the memorably-named Sex Machine each elevates \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" far above your average horror flick.

Some of the CGI could have aged better, and the pacing could be uneven. Yet, those don't significantly diminish the film's overall appeal.\n\nTo sum it up, \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" is a roller-coaster ride that dwells on an entirely different level of twisted creativity.

Affleck delivers a solid performance, but it's Pike who truly shines, delivering a chilling and complex portrayal of Amy that is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. \n\nThe narrative is cleverly structured, with the story unfolding through a series of flashbacks and present-day scenes. This non-linear storytelling adds to the suspense and keeps the audience guessing throughout. The plot is filled with unexpected twists and turns that will leave you questioning everything you thought you knew about the characters.\n\nFincher's direction is impeccable, creating a dark, tense atmosphere that perfectly complements the story.

The dialogue is sharp, witty, and often hilarious, providing a perfect balance to the film's more intense moments.\n\nThe performances are top-notch, with standout roles from Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, and Nick Moran.

The movie focuses on what it does best - showcasing spectacular alien robots interlocked in colossal warfare.\n\nMany may argue that Dark of the Moon lacks the tantalizing intrigue of the original Transformers movie, however, it certainly doesn't lack the high-powered energy and visually stunning scenes that the franchise is known for.\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon is a roller-coaster ride of thrilling sequences, supercool transforming bots and larger-than-life imagery. If you're purely in it for adrenaline-pumping CGI battles and destructiveness, then this film delivers in leaps and bounds.",

The film is a rollercoaster ride of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, capturing the essence of the rebellious spirit of the era.\n\nThe performances are the highlight of the film. Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning, who play Joan Jett and Cherie Currie respectively, deliver powerful performances that are both vulnerable and fierce. They embody their characters with such conviction that it's easy to forget you're watching a movie and not a documentary. Michael Shannon, as the eccentric and manipulative manager Kim Fowley, is equally impressive, adding a layer of dark humor to the film.\n\nThe film's narrative is unflinching in its depiction of the exploitation and struggles the band faced. It doesn't shy away from showing the darker side of fame, which is both its strength and weakness.
