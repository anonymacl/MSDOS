    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",

    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training.

    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges.

    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",
    "Mining and learning the shape variability of underlying population has\nbenefited the applications including parametric shape modeling, 3D animation,\nand image segmentation.

This paper\nformulates the pose learning problem as mixtures of factor analyzers. The\nsegmentation is obtained by components posterior probabilities and the\nrotations in pose variations are learned by the factor loading matrices. To\nguarantee that the factor loading matrices are composed by rotation matrices,\nconstraints are imposed and the corresponding closed form optimal solution is\nderived.

    "  Timed systems, such as timed automata, are usually analyzed using their\noperational semantics on timed words.

The main idea is to consider timed behaviors as graphs\nwith matching edges capturing timing constraints. When a family of graphs has\nbounded tree-width, they can be interpreted in trees and MSO-definable\nproperties of such graphs can be checked using tree automata. The technique is\nquite general and applies to many timed systems. In this paper, as an example,\nwe develop the technique on timed pushdown systems, which have recently\nreceived considerable attention. Further, we also demonstrate how we can use it\non timed automata and timed multi-stack pushdown systems (with boundedness\nrestrictions).\n",

A weakness of this approach is that different drivers\npossess vastly different densities at which traffic flow stagnates. This\ndrawback can be overcome by modifying the pressure relation in the ARZ model,\nleading to the generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang (GARZ) model.

The novelty of this model is that the\nUniverse includes both cases curvature and torsion, and one dominated by a\nChaplygin gas. In order to calculate cosmological solutions, we obtained\nFriedmann equations and also equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy.\nBy employing interacting model we considered the total energy density and the\ntotal pressure of Universe as the combination of components of dark energy and\nChaplygin gas.

    "Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) techniques based on Super Resolution\nConvolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) are applied to micro-computed tomography\n({\\mu}CT) images of sandstone and carbonate rocks. Digital rock imaging is\nlimited by the capability of the scanning device resulting in trade-offs\nbetween resolution and field of view, and super resolution methods tested in\nthis study aim to compensate for these limits. SRCNN models SR-Resnet, Enhanced\nDeep SR (EDSR), and Wide-Activation Deep SR (WDSR) are used on the Digital Rock\nSuper Resolution 1 (DRSRD1) Dataset of 4x downsampled images, comprising of\n2000 high resolution (800x800) raw micro-CT images of Bentheimer sandstone and\nEstaillades carbonate. The trained models are applied to the validation and\ntest data within the dataset and show a 3-5 dB rise in image quality compared\nto bicubic interpolation, with all tested models performing within a 0.1 dB\nrange. Difference maps indicate that edge sharpness is completely recovered in\nimages within the scope of the trained model, with only high frequency noise\nrelated detail loss. We find that aside from generation of high-resolution\nimages, a beneficial side effect of super resolution methods applied to\nsynthetically downgraded images is the removal of image noise while recovering\nedgewise sharpness which is beneficial for the segmentation process. The model\nis also tested against real low-resolution images of Bentheimer rock with image\naugmentation to account for natural noise and blur. The SRCNN method is shown\nto act as a preconditioner for image segmentation under these circumstances\nwhich naturally leads to further future development and training of models that\nsegment an image directly.

    "The development of high quality medical image segmentation algorithms depends\non the availability of large datasets with pixel-level labels. The challenges\nof collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to\ndevelop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to\nobtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their\ncorresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice\nnon-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that\nuse 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image\nsegmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the\nassumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new\nbounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of\npixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight\nbounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by\nevaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the\nproposed bounding box correction algorithm. When the tightness is improved by\nour solution, the results of the weakly-supervised segmentation become much\ncloser to those of the fully-supervised one.",
    "This paper presents a novel unsupervised segmentation method for 3D medical\nimages. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant advances\nin image segmentation. However, most of the recent methods rely on supervised\nlearning, which requires large amounts of manually annotated data. Thus, it is\nchallenging for these methods to cope with the growing amount of medical\nimages. This paper proposes a unified approach to unsupervised deep\nrepresentation learning and clustering for segmentation. Our proposed method\nconsists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn deep feature\nrepresentations of training patches from a target image using joint\nunsupervised learning (JULE) that alternately clusters representations\ngenerated by a CNN and updates the CNN parameters using cluster labels as\nsupervisory signals. We extend JULE to 3D medical images by utilizing 3D\nconvolutions throughout the CNN architecture. In the second phase, we apply\nk-means to the deep representations from the trained CNN and then project\ncluster labels to the target image in order to obtain the fully segmented\nimage. We evaluated our methods on three images of lung cancer specimens\nscanned with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The automatic segmentation\nof pathological regions in micro-CT could further contribute to the\npathological examination process.

    "  We study the impact of electrode band structure on transport through\nsingle-molecule junctions by measuring the conductance of pyridine-based\nmolecules using Ag and Au electrodes. Our experiments are carried out using the\nscanning tunneling microscope based break-junction technique and are supported\nby density functional theory based calculations. We find from both experiments\nand calculations that the coupling of the dominant transport orbital to the\nmetal is stronger for Au-based junctions when compared with Ag-based junctions.\nWe attribute this difference to relativistic effects, which results in an\nenhanced density of d-states at the Fermi energy for Au compared with Ag. We\nfurther show that the alignment of the conducting orbital relative to the Fermi\nlevel does not follow the work function difference between two metals and is\ndifferent for conjugated and saturated systems. We thus demonstrate that the\ndetails of the molecular level alignment and electronic coupling in\nmetal-organic interfaces do not follow simple rules, but are rather the\nconsequence of subtle local interactions.\n",
    "  Many practical sensing applications involve multiple sensors simultaneously\nacquiring measurements of a single object. Conversely, most existing sparse\nrecovery guarantees in compressed sensing concern only single-sensor\nacquisition scenarios. In this paper, we address the optimal recovery of\ncompressible signals from multi-sensor measurements using compressed sensing\ntechniques, thereby confirming the benefits of multi- over single-sensor\nenvironments. Throughout the paper, we consider a broad class of sensing\nmatrices, and two fundamentally different sampling scenarios (distinct and\nidentical respectively), both of which are relevant to applications. For the\ncase of diagonal sensor profile matrices (which characterize environmental\nconditions between a source and the sensors), this paper presents two key\nimprovements over existing results. First, a simpler optimal recovery guarantee\nfor distinct sampling, and second, an improved recovery guarantee for identical\nsampling, based on the so-called sparsity in levels signal model.\n",
    "This paper proposes the first, known to us, open source presentation attack\ndetection (PAD) solution to distinguish between authentic iris images (possibly\nwearing clear contact lenses) and irises with textured contact lenses.

The\nsoftware is written in C++ and Python and uses only open source resources, such\nas OpenCV. This method does not incorporate iris image segmentation, which may\nbe problematic for unknown fake samples. Instead, it makes a best guess to\nlocalize the rough position of the iris.

    "  Analyzing the exchange energy of two conduction electrons in a crystal we\nfind that the exchange energy may be negative and, thus, a singlet state may be\nfavorable. A full overlap in real space of wave functions of two conduction\nelectrons leads to a deeper exchange energy. Thus, the exchange interaction\ncauses a bond between two conduction electrons in real space. The singlet bond\nis possible because the singlet electrons can simultaneously and permanently\noccupy one spatial ground state, so the average energy of paired electrons is\nlower than the energy of unpaired electrons. Thus, the pairing is a result of\nthe Pauli Exclusion Principle. If conduction electrons, before pairing, are put\non the Fermi surface in the momentum space, then every pair may exist\npermanently in time. The motion of conduction electrons in the crystal may\nprevent the formation of Cooper pairs, because the kinetic energy of the motion\nis usually larger than the binding energy in the pair. Conduction electrons as\nstanding waves are local and have zero momenta, hence their momenta are\nsynchronous; therefore, weak singlet bonds are stable despite the large kinetic\nenergy on the Fermi surface. The local pairing of standing waves explains the\ninverse isotope effect, Tc-dome, insulator-superconductor transitions and many\nother facts about superconductors. The electron pairs, as bosons, can form a\nmacroscopically coherent Bose-Einstein-Condensate and, thus, become\nnon-dissipative and non-local.\n",

    "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly important due to their\nexcellent empirical performance on a wide range of problems. However,\nregularization is generally achieved by indirect means, largely due to the\ncomplex set of functions defined by a network and the difficulty in measuring\nfunction complexity. There exists no method in the literature for additive\nregularization based on a norm of the function, as is classically considered in\nstatistical learning theory. In this work, we propose sampling-based\napproximations to weighted function norms as regularizers for deep neural\nnetworks. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first proof in the\nliterature of the NP-hardness of computing function norms of DNNs, motivating\nthe necessity of an approximate approach. We then derive a generalization bound\nfor functions trained with weighted norms and prove that a natural stochastic\noptimization strategy minimizes the bound. Finally, we empirically validate the\nimproved performance of the proposed regularization strategies for both convex\nfunction sets as well as DNNs on real-world classification and image\nsegmentation tasks demonstrating improved performance over weight decay,\ndropout, and batch normalization.

    "  We propose and demonstrate localized mode coupling as a viable dispersion\nengineering technique for phase-matched resonant four-wave mixing (FWM). We\ndemonstrate a dual-cavity resonant structure that employs coupling-induced\nfrequency splitting at one of three resonances to compensate for cavity\ndispersion, enabling phase-matching. Coupling strength is controlled by thermal\ntuning of one cavity enabling active control of the resonant\nfrequency-matching. In a fabricated silicon microresonator, we show an 8 dB\nenhancement of seeded FWM efficiency over the non-compensated state. The\nmeasured four-wave mixing has a peak wavelength conversion efficiency of -37.9\ndB across a free spectral range (FSR) of 3.334 THz ($\\sim$27 nm). Enabled by\nstrong counteraction of dispersion, this FSR is, to our knowledge, the largest\nin silicon to demonstrate FWM to date. This form of mode-coupling-based, active\ndispersion compensation can be beneficial for many FWM-based devices including\nwavelength converters, parametric amplifiers, and widely detuned correlated\nphoton-pair sources. Apart from compensating intrinsic dispersion, the proposed\nmechanism can alternatively be utilized in an otherwise dispersionless\nresonator to counteract the detuning effect of self- and cross-phase modulation\non the pump resonance during FWM, thereby addressing a fundamental issue in the\nperformance of light sources such as broadband optical frequency combs.\n",

    "The random walker (RW) algorithm is used for both image segmentation and\nregistration, and possesses several useful properties that make it popular in\nmedical imaging, such as being globally optimizable, allowing user interaction,\nand providing uncertainty information. The RW algorithm defines a weighted\ngraph over an image and uses the graph's Laplacian matrix to regularize its\nsolutions. This regularization reduces to solving a large system of equations,\nwhich may be excessively time consuming in some applications, such as when\ninteracting with a human user. Techniques have been developed that precompute\neigenvectors of a Laplacian offline, after image acquisition but before any\nanalysis, in order speed up the RW algorithm online, when segmentation or\nregistration is being performed. However, precomputation requires certain\nalgorithm parameters be fixed offline, limiting their flexibility. In this\npaper, we develop techniques to update the precomputed data online when RW\nparameters are altered. Specifically, we dynamically determine the number of\neigenvectors needed for a desired accuracy based on user input, and derive\nupdate equations for the eigenvectors when the edge weights or topology of the\nimage graph are changed.

    "The main obstacle to weakly supervised semantic image segmentation is the\ndifficulty of obtaining pixel-level information from coarse image-level\nannotations.

    "Uncertainty estimation is important for interpreting the trustworthiness of\nmachine learning models in many applications. This is especially critical in\nthe data-driven active learning setting where the goal is to achieve a certain\naccuracy with minimum labeling effort. In such settings, the model learns to\nselect the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation based on its\nestimated uncertainty. The highly uncertain predictions are assumed to be more\ninformative for improving model performance. In this paper, we explore\nuncertainty calibration within an active learning framework for medical image\nsegmentation, an area where labels often are scarce. Various uncertainty\nestimation methods and acquisition strategies (regions and full images) are\ninvestigated. We observe that selecting regions to annotate instead of full\nimages leads to more well-calibrated models. Additionally, we experimentally\nshow that annotating regions can cut 50% of pixels that need to be labeled by\nhumans compared to annotating full images.",
    "  This paper presents a new Bayesian collaborative sparse regression method for\nlinear unmixing of hyperspectral images. Our contribution is twofold; first, we\npropose a new Bayesian model for structured sparse regression in which the\nsupports of the sparse abundance vectors are a priori spatially correlated\nacross pixels (i.e., materials are spatially organised rather than randomly\ndistributed at a pixel level). This prior information is encoded in the model\nthrough a truncated multivariate Ising Markov random field, which also takes\ninto consideration the facts that pixels cannot be empty (i.e, there is at\nleast one material present in each pixel), and that different materials may\nexhibit different degrees of spatial regularity. Secondly, we propose an\nadvanced Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the posterior\nprobabilities that materials are present or absent in each pixel, and,\nconditionally to the maximum marginal a posteriori configuration of the\nsupport, compute the MMSE estimates of the abundance vectors. A remarkable\nproperty of this algorithm is that it self-adjusts the values of the parameters\nof the Markov random field, thus relieving practitioners from setting\nregularisation parameters by cross-validation. The performance of the proposed\nmethodology is finally demonstrated through a series of experiments with\nsynthetic and real data and comparisons with other algorithms from the\nliterature.\n",
    "Superpixel segmentation has become an important research problem in image\nprocessing. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Spanning Forest (ISF)\nframework, based on sequences of Image Foresting Transforms, where one can\nchoose i) a seed sampling strategy, ii) a connectivity function, iii) an\nadjacency relation, and iv) a seed pixel recomputation procedure to generate\nimproved sets of connected superpixels (supervoxels in 3D) per iteration. The\nsuperpixels in ISF structurally correspond to spanning trees rooted at those\nseeds. We present five ISF methods to illustrate different choices of its\ncomponents. These methods are compared with approaches from the\nstate-of-the-art in effectiveness and efficiency. The experiments involve 2D\nand 3D datasets with distinct characteristics, and a high level application,\nnamed sky image segmentation.

    "It is important to find the target as soon as possible for search and rescue\noperations. Surveillance camera systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are\nused to support search and rescue. Automatic object detection is important\nbecause a person cannot monitor multiple surveillance screens simultaneously\nfor 24 hours. Also, the object is often too small to be recognized by the human\neye on the surveillance screen. This study used UAVs around the Port of Houston\nand fixed surveillance cameras to build an automatic target detection system\nthat supports the US Coast Guard (USCG) to help find targets (e.g., person\noverboard). We combined image segmentation, enhancement, and convolution neural\nnetworks to reduce detection time to detect small targets.

The wind flow is modeled by a\nmulti-mesh (cut finite element) method. This allows each building to be\nembedded in a boundary-fitted mesh which can be moved freely on top of a fixed\nbackground mesh. This approach enables a multitude of settlement layouts to be\nevaluated without the need for costly mesh generation when changing the\nconfiguration of buildings.

    "In photography, low depth of field (DOF) is an important technique to\nemphasize the object of interest (OOI) within an image. Thus, low DOF images\nare widely used in the application area of macro, portrait or sports\nphotography. When viewing a low DOF image, the viewer implicitly concentrates\non the regions that are sharper regions of the image and thus segments the\nimage into regions of interest and non regions of interest which has a major\nimpact on the perception of the image. Thus, a robust algorithm for the fully\nautomatic detection of the OOI in low DOF images provides valuable information\nfor subsequent image processing and image retrieval.

    "  We consider the Longest Queue Drop memory management policy in shared-memory\nswitches consisting of $N$ output ports. The shared memory of size $M\\geq N$\nmay have an arbitrary number of input ports. Each packet may be admitted by any\nincoming port, but must be destined to a specific output port and each output\nport may be used by only one queue. The Longest Queue Drop policy is a natural\nonline strategy used in directing the packet flow in buffering problems.\nAccording to this policy and assuming unit packet values and cost of\ntransmission, every incoming packet is accepted, whereas if the shared memory\nbecomes full, one or more packets belonging to the longest queue are preempted,\nin order to make space for the newly arrived packets. It was proved in 2001\n[Hahne et al., SPAA '01] that the Longest Queue Drop policy is 2-competitive\nand at least $\\sqrt{2}$-competitive.

    "We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network\narchitecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core\ntrainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding\ndecoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture\nof the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional\nlayers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low\nresolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for\npixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which\nthe decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically,\nthe decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the\ncorresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the\nneed for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then\nconvolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our\nproposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN and also with the well known\nDeepLab-LargeFOV, DeconvNet architectures. This comparison reveals the memory\nversus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance.\n  SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it\nis designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time\nduring inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable\nparameters than other competing architectures.

    "Methods that move towards less supervised scenarios are key for image\nsegmentation, as dense labels demand significant human intervention.

Egg images are segmented\nusing the K-means algorithm based on Lab color images. The results of the\nimages acquisition are converted into Lab color space images. The results of\nLab color space images are processed using K-means for each color. The K-means\nprocess uses cluster k=3, where this cluster divided the image into three\nparts, namely background, eggs, and yolk eggs. Yolk eggs are part of eggs that\nhave embryonic characteristics. This study applies the concept of color in the\ninitial segmentation and grayscale in the final stages.

    "Image segmentation is a fundamental research topic in image processing and\ncomputer vision. In the last decades, researchers developed a large number of\nsegmentation algorithms for various applications. Amongst these algorithms, the\nNormalized cut (Ncut) segmentation method is widely applied due to its good\nperformance. The Ncut segmentation model is an optimization problem whose\nenergy is defined on a specifically designed graph. Thus, the segmentation\nresults of the existing Ncut method are largely dependent on a pre-constructed\nsimilarity measure on the graph since this measure is usually given empirically\nby users. This flaw will lead to some undesirable segmentation results. In this\npaper, we propose a Ncut-based segmentation algorithm by integrating an\nadaptive similarity measure and spatial regularization. The proposed model\ncombines the Parzen-Rosenblatt window method, non-local weights entropy, Ncut\nenergy, and regularizer of phase field in a variational framework. Our method\ncan adaptively update the similarity measure function by estimating some\nparameters. This adaptive procedure enables the proposed algorithm finding a\nbetter similarity measure for classification than the Ncut method. We provide\nsome mathematical interpretation of the proposed adaptive similarity from\nmulti-viewpoints such as statistics and convex optimization. In addition, the\nregularizer of phase field can guarantee that the proposed algorithm has a\nrobust performance in the presence of noise, and it can also rectify the\nsimilarity measure with a spatial priori. The well-posed theory such as the\nexistence of the minimizer for the proposed model is given in the paper.\nCompared with some existing segmentation methods such as the traditional\nNcut-based model and the classical Chan-Vese model, the numerical experiments\nshow that our method can provide promising segmentation results.",
    "  Text data is often seen as \"take-away\" materials with little noise and easy\nto process information. Main questions are how to get data and transform them\ninto a good document format. But data can be sensitive to noise oftenly called\nambiguities. Ambiguities are aware from a long time, mainly because polysemy is\nobvious in language and context is required to remove uncertainty. I claim in\nthis paper that syntactic context is not suffisant to improve interpretation.\nIn this paper I try to explain that firstly noise can come from natural data\nthemselves, even involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified\nbut meaningless, can spoil content of a corpus; it may lead to contradictions\nand background noise.\n",
    "The task of image segmentation is inherently noisy due to ambiguities\nregarding the exact location of boundaries between anatomical structures. We\nargue that this information can be extracted from the expert annotations at no\nextra cost, and when integrated into state-of-the-art neural networks, it can\nlead to improved calibration between soft probabilistic predictions and the\nunderlying uncertainty. We built upon label smoothing (LS) where a network is\ntrained on 'blurred' versions of the ground truth labels which has been shown\nto be effective for calibrating output predictions. However, LS is not taking\nthe local structure into account and results in overly smoothed predictions\nwith low confidence even for non-ambiguous regions. Here, we propose Spatially\nVarying Label Smoothing (SVLS), a soft labeling technique that captures the\nstructural uncertainty in semantic segmentation. SVLS also naturally lends\nitself to incorporate inter-rater uncertainty when multiple labelmaps are\navailable. The proposed approach is extensively validated on four clinical\nsegmentation tasks with different imaging modalities, number of classes and\nsingle and multi-rater expert annotations. The results demonstrate that SVLS,\ndespite its simplicity, obtains superior boundary prediction with improved\nuncertainty and model calibration.",
    "Medical image segmentation is inherently an ambiguous task due to factors\nsuch as partial volumes and variations in anatomical definitions. While in most\ncases the segmentation uncertainty is around the border of structures of\ninterest, there can also be considerable inter-rater differences. The class of\nconditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) offers a principled approach to\ninferring distributions over plausible segmentations that are conditioned on\ninput images. Segmentation uncertainty estimated from samples of such\ndistributions can be more informative than using pixel level probability\nscores. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model that is\nbased on conditional Normalizing Flow (cFlow). The basic idea is to increase\nthe expressivity of the cVAE by introducing a cFlow transformation step after\nthe encoder. This yields improved approximations of the latent posterior\ndistribution, allowing the model to capture richer segmentation variations.\nWith this we show that the quality and diversity of samples obtained from our\nconditional generative model is enhanced. Performance of our model, which we\ncall cFlow Net, is evaluated on two medical imaging datasets demonstrating\nsubstantial improvements in both qualitative and quantitative measures when\ncompared to a recent cVAE based model.",
    "Currently, developments of deep learning techniques are providing\ninstrumental to identify, classify, and quantify patterns in medical images.\nSegmentation is one of the important applications in medical image analysis. In\nthis regard, U-Net is the predominant approach to medical image segmentation\ntasks. However, we found that those U-Net based models have limitations in\nseveral aspects, for example, millions of parameters in the U-Net consuming\nconsiderable computation resource and memory, lack of global information, and\nmissing some tough objects. Therefore, we applied two modifications to improve\nthe U-Net model: 1) designed and added the dilated channel-wise CNN module, 2)\nsimplified the U shape network. Based on these two modifications, we proposed a\nnovel light-weight architecture -- Channel-wise Feature Pyramid Network for\nMedicine (CFPNet-M). To evaluate our method, we selected five datasets with\ndifferent modalities: thermography, electron microscopy, endoscopy, dermoscopy,\nand digital retinal images. And we compared its performance with several models\nhaving different parameter scales. This paper also involves our previous\nstudies of DC-UNet and some commonly used light-weight neural networks. We\napplied the Tanimoto similarity instead of the Jaccard index for gray-level\nimage measurements. By comparison, CFPNet-M achieves comparable segmentation\nresults on all five medical datasets with only 0.65 million parameters, which\nis about 2% of U-Net, and 8.8 MB memory.

    "  In the current hyper-connected era, modern Information and Communication\nTechnology systems form sophisticated networks where not only do people\ninteract with other people, but also machines take an increasingly visible and\nparticipatory role. Such human-machine networks (HMNs) are embedded in the\ndaily lives of people, both for personal and professional use. They can have a\nsignificant impact by producing synergy and innovations. The challenge in\ndesigning successful HMNs is that they cannot be developed and implemented in\nthe same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, nor following a wholly\nhuman-centric view of the network. The problem requires an interdisciplinary\napproach. Here, we review current research of relevance to HMNs across many\ndisciplines. Extending the previous theoretical concepts of socio-technical\nsystems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social\nmachines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans\nand machines. We identify eight types of HMNs: public-resource computing,\ncrowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media,\nmultiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. We\nsystematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a\nfocus on implications for designing HMNs.

    "  In a k-linear triangulated category (where k is a field) we show that the\nexistence of Auslander-Reiten triangles implies that objects are determined, up\nto shift, by knowing dimensions of homomorphisms between them. In most cases\nthe objects themselves are distinguished by this information, a conclusion\nwhich was also reached under slightly different hypotheses in a theorem of\nJensen, Su and Zimmermann. The approach is to consider bilinear forms on\nGrothendieck groups which are analogous to the Green ring of a finite group.\n  We specialize to the category of perfect complexes for a self-injective\nalgebra, for which the Auslander-Reiten quiver has a known shape. We\ncharacterize the position in the quiver of many kinds of perfect complexes,\nincluding those of lengths 1, 2 and 3, rigid complexes and truncated projective\nresolutions. We describe completely the quiver components which contain\nprojective modules. We obtain relationships between the homology of complexes\nat different places in the quiver, deducing that every self-injective algebra\nof radical length at least 3 has indecomposable perfect complexes with\narbitrarily large homology in any given degree. We find also that homology\nstabilizes away from the rim of the quiver. We show that when the algebra is\nsymmetric, one of the forms considered earlier is Hermitian, and this allows us\nto compute its values knowing them only on objects on the rim of the quiver.\n",

    "Recent advances in deep learning based image segmentation methods have\nenabled real-time performance with human-level accuracy. However, occasionally\neven the best method fails due to low image quality, artifacts or unexpected\nbehaviour of black box algorithms. Being able to predict segmentation quality\nin the absence of ground truth is of paramount importance in clinical practice,\nbut also in large-scale studies to avoid the inclusion of invalid data in\nsubsequent analysis.\n  In this work, we propose two approaches of real-time automated quality\ncontrol for cardiovascular MR segmentations using deep learning.

    "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have had unprecedented success in medical\nimaging and, in particular, in medical image segmentation. However, despite the\nfact that segmentation results are closer than ever to the inter-expert\nvariability, CNNs are not immune to producing anatomically inaccurate\nsegmentations, even when built upon a shape prior. In this paper, we present a\nframework for producing cardiac image segmentation maps that are guaranteed to\nrespect pre-defined anatomical criteria, while remaining within the\ninter-expert variability. The idea behind our method is to use a well-trained\nCNN, have it process cardiac images, identify the anatomically implausible\nresults and warp these results toward the closest anatomically valid cardiac\nshape. This warping procedure is carried out with a constrained variational\nautoencoder (cVAE) trained to learn a representation of valid cardiac shapes\nthrough a smooth, yet constrained, latent space. With this cVAE, we can project\nany implausible shape into the cardiac latent space and steer it toward the\nclosest correct shape. We tested our framework on short-axis MRI as well as\napical two and four-chamber view ultrasound images, two modalities for which\ncardiac shapes are drastically different.

    "Compared to the general semantic segmentation problem, portrait segmentation\nhas higher precision requirement on boundary area. However, this problem has\nnot been well studied in previous works. In this paper, we propose a\nboundary-sensitive deep neural network (BSN) for portrait segmentation. BSN\nintroduces three novel techniques. First, an individual boundary-sensitive\nkernel is proposed by dilating the contour line and assigning the boundary\npixels with multi-class labels. Second, a global boundary-sensitive kernel is\nemployed as a position sensitive prior to further constrain the overall shape\nof the segmentation map. Third, we train a boundary-sensitive attribute\nclassifier jointly with the segmentation network to reinforce the network with\nsemantic boundary shape information. We have evaluated BSN on the current\nlargest public portrait segmentation dataset, i.e, the PFCN dataset, as well as\nthe portrait images collected from other three popular image segmentation\ndatasets: COCO, COCO-Stuff, and PASCAL VOC. Our method achieves the superior\nquantitative and qualitative performance over state-of-the-arts on all the\ndatasets, especially on the boundary area.",
    "In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to discriminate between cultivated\nmaize plant and grass or grass-like weed image segments using the context\nsurrounding the image segments. While convolutional neural networks have\nbrought state of the art accuracies within object detection, errors arise when\nobjects in different classes share similar features. This scenario often occurs\nwhen objects in images are viewed at too small of a scale to discern distinct\ndifferences in features, causing images to be incorrectly classified or\nlocalized. To solve this problem, we will explore using context when\nclassifying image segments. This technique involves feeding a convolutional\nneural network a central square image along with a border of its direct\nsurroundings at train and test times. This means that although images are\nlabelled at a smaller scale to preserve accurate localization, the network\nclassifies the images and learns features that include the wider context. We\ndemonstrate the benefits of this context technique in the object detection task\nthrough a case study of grass (foxtail) and grass-like (yellow nutsedge) weed\ndetection in maize fields. In this standard situation, adding context alone\nnearly halved the error of the neural network from 7.1% to 4.3%. After only one\nepoch with context, the network also achieved a higher accuracy than the\nnetwork without context did after 50 epochs. The benefits of using the context\ntechnique are likely to particularly evident in agricultural contexts in which\nparts (such as leaves) of several plants may appear similar when not taking\ninto account the context in which those parts appear.",
    "  An information theoretic approach to bounds in superconformal field theories\nis proposed.

    "In the recent years, convolutional neural networks have transformed the field\nof medical image analysis due to their capacity to learn discriminative image\nfeatures for a variety of classification and regression tasks. However,\nsuccessfully learning these features requires a large amount of manually\nannotated data, which is expensive to acquire and limited by the available\nresources of expert image analysts. Therefore, unsupervised, weakly-supervised\nand self-supervised feature learning techniques receive a lot of attention,\nwhich aim to utilise the vast amount of available data, while at the same time\navoid or substantially reduce the effort of manual annotation. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel way for training a cardiac MR image segmentation network, in\nwhich features are learnt in a self-supervised manner by predicting anatomical\npositions.

We demonstrate that this seemingly simple task\nprovides a strong signal for feature learning and with self-supervised\nlearning, we achieve a high segmentation accuracy that is better than or\ncomparable to a U-net trained from scratch, especially at a small data setting.\nWhen only five annotated subjects are available, the proposed method improves\nthe mean Dice metric from 0.811 to 0.852 for short-axis image segmentation,\ncompared to the baseline U-net.",
    "Medical image segmentation plays an essential role in developing\ncomputer-assisted diagnosis and therapy systems, yet still faces many\nchallenges. In the past few years, the popular encoder-decoder architectures\nbased on CNNs (e.g., U-Net) have been successfully applied in the task of\nmedical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution\noperations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and\nlong-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce\ntransformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results,\nbut the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational\ncomplexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which\nintegrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and\naccurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder\nof the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the\nTransformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks\nand convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via\nskip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the\nfeature maps.

    "We propose adversarial constrained-CNN loss, a new paradigm of\nconstrained-CNN loss methods, for weakly supervised medical image segmentation.\nIn the new paradigm, prior knowledge is encoded and depicted by reference\nmasks, and is further employed to impose constraints on segmentation outputs\nthrough adversarial learning with reference masks. Unlike pseudo label methods\nfor weakly supervised segmentation, such reference masks are used to train a\ndiscriminator rather than a segmentation network, and thus are not required to\nbe paired with specific images. Our new paradigm not only greatly facilitates\nimposing prior knowledge on network's outputs, but also provides stronger and\nhigher-order constraints, i.e., distribution approximation, through adversarial\nlearning. Extensive experiments involving different medical modalities,\ndifferent anatomical structures, different topologies of the object of\ninterest, different levels of prior knowledge and weakly supervised annotations\nwith different annotation ratios is conducted to evaluate our ACCL method.\nConsistently superior segmentation results over the size constrained-CNN loss\nmethod have been achieved, some of which are close to the results of full\nsupervision, thus fully verifying the effectiveness and generalization of our\nmethod.

    "Automatic parsing of anatomical objects in X-ray images is critical to many\nclinical applications in particular towards image-guided invention and workflow\nautomation.

The\nTD-GAN framework is general and can be easily adapted to other learning tasks.\nIn the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and\n153 topograms.

We disprove this conjecture by showing that the\ncolors of singular points of the cycle may affect the dimensions. However, the\ncolors of smooth points are irrelevant. By using bistellar moves we show that\nthe number of different dimension vectors arising on a given 3-dimensional\npseudomanifold with isolated singularities is a topological invariant. This\ninvariant is trivial on manifolds, but nontrivial in general.\n",
    "In Computer Vision, edge detection is one of the favored approaches for\nfeature and object detection in images since it provides information about\ntheir objects boundaries. Other region-based approaches use probabilistic\nanalysis such as clustering and Markov random fields, but those methods cannot\nbe used to analyze edges and their interaction. In fact, only image\nsegmentation can produce regions based on edges, but it requires thresholding\nby simply separating the regions into binary in-out information. Hence, there\nis currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, since edges\ncannot be used to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The\nobjective of this paper is to present a novel spatial probability analysis that\nallows determining the probability of inclusion inside a set of partial\ncontours (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed a new approach that\nuses electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the\nrequired probabilities. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a continuous\nspace of probability based only on the edge information, thus bridging the gap\nbetween the edge-based methods and the region-based methods. The developed\nmethod is consistent with the fundamental properties of inclusion probabilities\nand its results are validated by comparing an image with the probability-based\nestimation given by our algorithm. The method can also be generalized to take\ninto consideration the intensity of the edges or to be used for 3D shapes. This\nis the first documented method that allows computing a space of probability\nbased on interacting edges, which opens the path to broader applications such\nas image segmentation and contour completion.",
    "America has a massive railway system. As of 2006, U.S. freight railroads have\n140,490 route- miles of standard gauge, but maintaining such a huge system and\neliminating any dangers, like reduced track stability and poor drainage, caused\nby railway ballast degradation require huge amount of labor. The traditional\nway to quantify the degradation of ballast is to use an index called Fouling\nIndex (FI) through ballast sampling and sieve analysis. However, determining\nthe FI values in lab is very time-consuming and laborious, but with the help of\nrecent development in the field of computer vision, a novel method for a\npotential machine-vison based ballast inspection system can be employed that\ncan hopefully replace the traditional mechanical method. The new machine-vision\napproach analyses the images of the in-service ballasts, and then utilizes\nimage segmentation algorithm to get ballast segments. By comparing the segment\nresults and their corresponding FI values, this novel method produces a\nmachine-vision-based index that has the best-fit relation with FI. The\nimplementation details of how this algorithm works are discussed in this\nreport.",
    "This paper aims at developing an integrated system of clothing co-parsing, in\norder to jointly parse a set of clothing images (unsegmented but annotated with\ntags) into semantic configurations. We propose a data-driven framework\nconsisting of two phases of inference. The first phase, referred as \"image\nco-segmentation\", iterates to extract consistent regions on images and jointly\nrefines the regions over all images by employing the exemplar-SVM (E-SVM)\ntechnique [23]. In the second phase (i.e. \"region co-labeling\"), we construct a\nmulti-image graphical model by taking the segmented regions as vertices, and\nincorporate several contexts of clothing configuration (e.g., item location and\nmutual interactions). The joint label assignment can be solved using the\nefficient Graph Cuts algorithm. In addition to evaluate our framework on the\nFashionista dataset [30], we construct a dataset called CCP consisting of 2098\nhigh-resolution street fashion photos to demonstrate the performance of our\nsystem. We achieve 90.29% / 88.23% segmentation accuracy and 65.52% / 63.89%\nrecognition rate on the Fashionista and the CCP datasets, respectively, which\nare superior compared with state-of-the-art methods.",
    "Color and intensity are two important components in an image. Usually, groups\nof image pixels, which are similar in color or intensity, are an informative\nrepresentation for an object. They are therefore particularly suitable for\ncomputer vision tasks, such as saliency detection and object proposal\ngeneration. However, image pixels, which share a similar real-world color, may\nbe quite different since colors are often distorted by intensity. In this\npaper, we reinvestigate the affinity matrices originally used in image\nsegmentation methods based on spectral clustering. A new affinity matrix, which\nis robust to color distortions, is formulated for object discovery. Moreover, a\nCohesion Measurement (CM) for object regions is also derived based on the\nformulated affinity matrix. Based on the new Cohesion Measurement, a novel\nobject discovery method is proposed to discover objects latent in an image by\nutilizing the eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. Then we apply the proposed\nmethod to both saliency detection and object proposal generation. Experimental\nresults on several evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CM based\nmethod has achieved promising performance for these two tasks.",
    "The automated segmentation of buildings in remote sensing imagery is a\nchallenging task that requires the accurate delineation of multiple building\ninstances over typically large image areas. Manual methods are often laborious\nand current deep-learning-based approaches fail to delineate all building\ninstances and do so with adequate accuracy. As a solution, we present Trainable\nDeep Active Contours (TDACs), an automatic image segmentation framework that\nintimately unites Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Active Contour\nModels (ACMs). The Eulerian energy functional of the ACM component includes\nper-pixel parameter maps that are predicted by the backbone CNN, which also\ninitializes the ACM. Importantly, both the ACM and CNN components are fully\nimplemented in TensorFlow and the entire TDAC architecture is end-to-end\nautomatically differentiable and backpropagation trainable without user\nintervention. TDAC yields fast, accurate, and fully automatic simultaneous\ndelineation of arbitrarily many buildings in the image. We validate the model\non two publicly available aerial image datasets for building segmentation, and\nour results demonstrate that TDAC establishes a new state-of-the-art\nperformance.",
    "We present a method combining affinity prediction with region agglomeration,\nwhich improves significantly upon the state of the art of neuron segmentation\nfrom electron microscopy (EM) in accuracy and scalability. Our method consists\nof a 3D U-NET, trained to predict affinities between voxels, followed by\niterative region agglomeration. We train using a structured loss based on\nMALIS, encouraging topologically correct segmentations obtained from affinity\nthresholding. Our extension consists of two parts: First, we present a\nquasi-linear method to compute the loss gradient, improving over the original\nquadratic algorithm. Second, we compute the gradient in two separate passes to\navoid spurious gradient contributions in early training stages. Our predictions\nare accurate enough that simple learning-free percentile-based agglomeration\noutperforms more involved methods used earlier on inferior predictions. We\npresent results on three diverse EM datasets, achieving relative improvements\nover previous results of 27%, 15%, and 250%. Our findings suggest that a single\nmethod can be applied to both nearly isotropic block-face EM data and\nanisotropic serial sectioned EM data. The runtime of our method scales linearly\nwith the size of the volume and achieves a throughput of about 2.6 seconds per\nmegavoxel, qualifying our method for the processing of very large datasets.",
    "  A single crystal of isovalently substituted Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ru$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$\n($x=0.24$) was sequentially irradiated with 2.5 MeV electrons up to a maximum\ndose of $2.1 \\times 10^{19}$ electrons/cm^2. The electrical resistivity was\nmeasured \\textit{in - situ} at $T=$22 K during the irradiation and \\textit{ex -\nsitu} as a function of temperature between subsequent irradiation runs. Upon\nirradiation, the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, decreases and\nthe residual resistivity, $\\rho_0$, increases. We find that electron\nirradiation leads to the fastest suppression of $T_c$ compared to other types\nof artificially introduced disorder, probably due to the strong short-range\npotential of the point-like irradiation defects. A more detailed analysis\nwithin a multiband scenario with variable scattering potential strength shows\nthat the observed $T_c$ vs. $\\rho_0$ is fully compatible with $s_\\pm$ pairing,\nin contrast to earlier claims that this model leads to a too rapid a\nsuppression of $T_c$ with scattering.\n",
    "  A Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) physics program of three LAr-TPC detectors\nlocated along the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab is presented. This\nnew SBN Program will deliver a rich and compelling physics opportunity,\nincluding the ability to resolve a class of experimental anomalies in neutrino\nphysics and to perform the most sensitive search to date for sterile neutrinos\nat the eV mass-scale through both appearance and disappearance oscillation\nchannels.

    "Image foreground extraction is a classical problem in image processing and\nvision, with a large range of applications. In this dissertation, we focus on\nthe extraction of text and graphics in mixed-content images, and design novel\napproaches for various aspects of this problem.\n  We first propose a sparse decomposition framework, which models the\nbackground by a subspace containing smooth basis vectors, and foreground as a\nsparse and connected component. We then formulate an optimization framework to\nsolve this problem, by adding suitable regularizations to the cost function to\npromote the desired characteristics of each component. We present two\ntechniques to solve the proposed optimization problem, one based on alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM), and the other one based on robust\nregression. Promising results are obtained for screen content image\nsegmentation using the proposed algorithm.\n  We then propose a robust subspace learning algorithm for the representation\nof the background component using training images that could contain both\nbackground and foreground components, as well as noise. With the learnt\nsubspace for the background, we can further improve the segmentation results,\ncompared to using a fixed subspace. Lastly, we investigate a different class of\nsignal/image decomposition problem, where only one signal component is active\nat each signal element. In this case, besides estimating each component, we\nneed to find their supports, which can be specified by a binary mask. We\npropose a mixed-integer programming problem, that jointly estimates the two\ncomponents and their supports through an alternating optimization scheme. We\nshow the application of this algorithm on various problems, including image\nsegmentation, video motion segmentation, and also separation of text from\ntextured images.",
    "  We develop a system for measurements of power spectra of transmitted light\nintensity fluctuations, in which the extraneous noise, including shot noise, is\nreduced. In essence, we just apply light, measure the power of the transmitted\nlight and derive its power spectrum. We use this to observe the spontaneous\nnoise spectra of photon atom interactions. Applying light with frequency\nmodulation, we can also observe the spontaneous noise reflecting the coherence\nbetween the hyperfine levels in the excited state. There are two in novel\ncomponents in the measurement system, the noise reduction scheme and the\nstabilization of the laser system. The noise reduction mechanism can be used to\nreduce the shot noise contribution to arbitrarily low levels through averaging,\nin principle. This is combined with differential detection to keep unwanted\nnoise at low levels. The laser system is stabilized to obtain spectral width\nbelow 1\\,kHz without high frequency ($\\gtrsim10\\,$MHz) noise. These methods are\ndescribed systematically and the performance of the asurement system is\nexamined through experimental results.\n",
    "  We propose a new class of models specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\ndata analysis. To this end, we generalize the spatial autoregressive model with\nautoregressive and heteroskedastic disturbances, i.e. SARAR(1,1), by exploiting\nthe recent advancements in Score Driven (SD) models typically used in time\nseries econometrics. In particular, we allow for time-varying spatial\nautoregressive coefficients as well as time-varying regressor coefficients and\ncross-sectional standard deviations. We report an extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulation study in order to investigate the finite sample properties of the\nMaximum Likelihood estimator for the new class of models as well as its\nflexibility in explaining several dynamic spatial dependence processes.

    "The performance of deep networks for semantic image segmentation largely\ndepends on the availability of large-scale training images which are labelled\nat the pixel level. Typically, such pixel-level image labellings are obtained\nmanually by a labour-intensive process. To alleviate the burden of manual image\nlabelling, we propose an interesting learning approach to generate pixel-level\nimage labellings automatically. A Guided Filter Network (GFN) is first\ndeveloped to learn the segmentation knowledge from a source domain, and such\nGFN then transfers such segmentation knowledge to generate coarse object masks\nin the target domain. Such coarse object masks are treated as pseudo labels and\nthey are further integrated to optimize/refine the GFN iteratively in the\ntarget domain. Our experiments on six image sets have demonstrated that our\nproposed approach can generate fine-grained object masks (i.e., pixel-level\nobject labellings), whose quality is very comparable to the manually-labelled\nones. Our proposed approach can also achieve better performance on semantic\nimage segmentation than most existing weakly-supervised approaches.",
    "Tensor networks provide an efficient approximation of operations involving\nhigh dimensional tensors and have been extensively used in modelling quantum\nmany-body systems. More recently, supervised learning has been attempted with\ntensor networks, primarily focused on tasks such as image classification.

We use the matrix product state (MPS) tensor network on non-overlapping\npatches of a given input image to predict the segmentation mask by learning a\npixel-wise linear classification rule in a high dimensional space. The proposed\nmodel is end-to-end trainable using backpropagation. It is implemented as a\nStrided Tensor Network to reduce the parameter complexity. The performance of\nthe proposed method is evaluated on two public medical imaging datasets and\ncompared to relevant baselines.

    "  A path in an edge-colored graph $G$ is rainbow if no two edges of it are\ncolored the same. The graph $G$ is rainbow-connected if there is a rainbow path\nbetween every pair of vertices.

    "All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.\nMoazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn't do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don't see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.",
    "Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"",

They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos.

The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.

Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.\n\"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over. What can you do but laugh about it? It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.\n\"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\"",

    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it.

    "AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United \"know they made a mistake\" by selling him in 2001.\nThe sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. \"United made a mistake in selling me,\" Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. \"I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. \"There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?\"\nWednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. \"We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone,\" he said. \"Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. \"I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do.\"",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",

    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.\nVedomosti newspaper reported that Russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\nGazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.",
    "Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.\nAlan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.

    "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.\nInbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",

    "You can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.",
    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.",
    "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\nMr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

    "Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has played down reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona.\n\"He's been responding well to treatment and started running on Friday, but we'll have to wait and see,\" he told BBC Five Live's Sportsweek. \"We're looking to getting him back as soon as possible, but he'll be back when it's right for him and for us. \"There's no plans at the moment around the Barcelona game.\" His comments contradict those of chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman who treated the Dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of February. Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.

    "Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 \n - A freeze on petrol duty \n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.\"\nBut Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.",
    "Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"\nThe Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n\"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages.

    "Jesper Gronkjaer has agreed a move to Atletico Madrid from Birmingham City.\nThe 27-year-old winger spent just five months at St Andrews following a £2.2m move from Chelsea in July after playing for Denmark at Euro 2004. He is set to move during the January transfer window in a deal rumoured to be about £1.4m, subject to a medical. \"We will meet with the player's representative to finalise the contract and decide when he will sign,\" said Atletico sporting director Toni Munoz. Gronkjaer has been targeted by Blues fans and was sarcastically applauded when taken off against Everton last month. Boss Steve Bruce had said that he would be happy to let the Danish international go if the price was right. He added: \"I'm not going to say the decision to let him go is down to the fans' reaction towards him.\n\"He has had a tough time since the summer with the loss of his mother and finding it difficult to adjust to a new club and a different area. \"He has been terrific and not missed a day's training and is someone if your daughter brought them home you would be delighted. \"It just hasn't quite worked out here for him.

    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W.

There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",
    "World 5000m champion Eliud Kipchoge won the 9.2km race at the View From Great Edinburgh Cross Country.\nThe Kenyan, who was second when Newcastle hosted the race last year, was in front from the outset. Ethiopian duo Gebre Gebremariam and Dejene Berhanu made last-gasp efforts to overtake him, but Kipchoge responded and a burst of speed clinched victory. Gavin Thompson was the first Briton in 12th place while Nick McCormick held of his British rivals to win the 4km race. The Morpeth Harrier led from the end of the first lap and ended Mike Skinner and Andrew Baddeley's hopes with a surge in the lasp lap. \"My training has gone so well I wasn't really worried about the opposition asI knew I was in great shape,\" said McCormick, who now hopes to earn a 1,500m place in the British team for the World Championships in Helsinki. In the women's race, Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba won a battle with world cross country champion Benita Johnson to retain her title. Australian Johnson, who shocked her African rivals in Brussels last March, looked to be on course for another win in the 6.2km race. But world 5000m champion Dibaba make a telling strike for the finishing line in the final 20 metres. Britons Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling were out of contention early on.",
    "Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. But what you will not find is much Spanish-language hip-hop.\nHip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now, a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. They have a devoted fan base in their native Monterrey. But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\nTheir biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O'Leary. \"I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.",
    "The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.\nIt is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.\nOnce completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. \"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,\" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.\nIn second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.\nSince the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",

    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. \"He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did,\" Keegan said. \"He has worked hard to get back to where he is now.\" The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"",
    "Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner.

    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.\nAfter Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: \"It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. \"We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.\" Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. \"It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams.\"",
    "Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"",
    "Pop singer Delta Goodrem has scooped one of the top individual prizes at the first Australian MTV Music Awards.\nThe 21-year-old singer won the award for best female artist, with Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll taking the title of best male at the ceremony. Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won awards for best R 'n' B video and sexiest video, both for Hey Mama. Local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins took the title of breakthrough artist of the year, with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian taking the honours for best pop video. The VH1 First Music Award went to Cher honouring her achievements within the music industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbour and was hosted by the Osbourne family. Artists including Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osbourne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia gave live performances at the event.",
    "Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.\nMoya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\"",
    "A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's \"lackadaisical\" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.\nPublic accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was \"dragging its heels\".\nThat comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been \"dreadfully slow\" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.\nThe outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. \"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,\" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.\nMinisters had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between \"two and three times\" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, \"but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations\".\nMr Leigh said being \"better prepared\" would also help avoid the need for \"mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak\". A Defra spokesman said: \"We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. \"However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.\"",
    "Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.\nThe beta program only works on PCs running Windows XP or Windows 2000. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files. Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.\n\"Our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft's MSN internet division. Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program. The software giant is coming late to the desktop search arena, competing with a large number of rivals. Google has already released a desktop tool. Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year. Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",

But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn't let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life.

    "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\nAgriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.",
    "Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's \"bullying\" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.\nShe said \"superior\" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen's former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said. She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking \"agendas\".\n\"I had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are.\" Media observers had been surprised by Greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: \"I'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I don't discuss them. \"I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them.\" Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.\nOther celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.\nVOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?   Yes  No   Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion\nHappy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still \"wide open\", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1. DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes.

    "Tony Blair has pledged to \"never, ever, ever\" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.\nThe prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: \"If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically.\" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were \"anti-Semitic\". These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\nMr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\nRates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
    "Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.",
    "Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?\"",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"",

Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.

    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.\nNew owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.",
    "The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \n \nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \n \nUniversal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425). \n \nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). \n \nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n \nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n \nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",
    "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",
    "Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\nThe thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.\nThese online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn't lead it.\"\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,\" said Mr Nachison. \"And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.\"",
    "China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week. Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT.",
    "Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.",
    "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
    "Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.\nMore than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club.\nAnelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: \"I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. \"We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club.\" Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: \"There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka.\n\"If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. \"If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. \"We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that.\" Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: \"I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. \"If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. \"But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. \"He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club.\" City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: \"Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. \"We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing.\"",
    "The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\nThe Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\nCampaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\nIn a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\nSaying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\nMr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\nLabour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.",

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"",

Lee told them to \"work up the corporate ladder because everybody can't be an actor, everybody can't make a record\". He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films.\nReturning to his old university, which educates only African American students, Lee discussed the challenges facing black people in the entertainment industry. \"Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,\" Lee said. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. \"It's a huge market,\" the 47-year-old director said. \"It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild.\" Lee has made more than 25 films, including Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, Summer of Sam and 1986 hit She's Gotta Have It.",
    "Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.\nLaunched this week, the World Community Grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.\nAnyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the WGC website. Once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.\nThe subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.\n\"The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,\" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. \"[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems\", she added. IBM has donated the hardware, software, technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid.

News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",
    "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "Campaigners against the expansion of Britain's airports have begun challenging the government's plans in the High Court.\nBAA's expansion of Stansted Airport in Essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. Opponents say the £2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used. They said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick. They have said they cannot raise the money needed for the Stansted upgrades from current landing charges. BAA also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. Their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at Luton Airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at Heathrow. If the group wins, the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport White Paper could be left in ruins.\nThe campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the Isle of Sheppey east of London. Lord Hanningfield, leader of Essex County Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are going to the High Court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. \"We want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation, consultation and thought before the government came out with its Green Paper. \"Then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.\" He added: \"Politicians should not decide where runways should be.\" The Stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.\nThe airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the UK. But BAA has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. BAA is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.",
    "Olympic champion Justine Henin-Hardenne will return to action in January's Sydney International tournament.\nThe Belgian has not competed since losing her top world ranking at the US Open in September, where she was beaten in the fourth round by Nadia Petrova. She took time out to shake off a virus but will defend her titles in Sydney and at the Australian Open. Women's world number one Lindsay Davenport and French Open champion Anastasia Myskina will also compete.\nIn the men's event, world number three Lleyton Hewitt returns to defend his title, along with runner-up Carlos Moya. Moya, Spain's Davis Cup final hero in their recent win over the US, had to retire with an ankle injury in the first set of the final.\nTournament director Craig Watson said: \"I had a message relayed to me from him after Spain's Davis Cup victory, saying he was looking forward to trying to make up for his disappointment in the (2004) final. The tournament will take place from 9-15 January.",
    "What have the European Indoor trials told us? Well, I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects.\nIt was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.\nThe best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton's win in the 60m hurdles. Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. But what was great about Sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. Diane Allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah. And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head-to-head race will give Sarah confidence. In the men's race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. In fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid.\nPhillips Idowu lit up the field events, not only with his hair, but also with his leap of 17.30m, which puts him at the top of the world rankings. I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. He feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then Phillips always has. A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance. He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. Across the board I thought Kelly Sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. She picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than that. Kelly will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far.\nShe has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. It wasn't all good news in Sheffield. I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. Jason Gardener may have won but he wasn't at his best. I chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. He's there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. In the women's race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka. The pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but Joice had to pull out with a chest infection. If she had made the final I think Jeanette would have gone a bit quicker.\nJanine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case. The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her. A couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding Mark Findlay and Rabah Yusuf. Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for Great Britain. Yusuf, who came third in the 400m, is from the Sudan but is trying to gain British citizenship. He came to Britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe, started doing more running and found his talent. So we shall have to see what happens to both of them.",
    "Oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.\nLondon Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. \"It's amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.\nThe stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month highs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of Thursday.\nIn London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.\nThe price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.\nFears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in north America would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise. \"Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,\" said Kyle Cooper, at Citigroup Global Markets. \"Long term I think we're headed to $30-35 but I don't think we're doing that yet. We have a lot of winter left.\" John Person, president of National Futures Advisory Services, said the EIA data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the US. .",
    "The blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog Ofcom has said.\nContent on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV-quality video online becomes a norm. At a debate in Westminster, the net industry considered the options. Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. At the debate, organised by the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA), Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.\n\"The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves,\" he said. Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion.\nSome studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net. More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB, ITV and the BBC. Head of the division, Andrew Burke, spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. \"How risque can I be in this new age? With celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners, surely I can push it to the limit,\" he said.\nIn fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. Internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the Law Commission dubbed them \"mere conduits\" back in 2002. This defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. The level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali, said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. Huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the BBC offer TV content over the net. The BBC's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as EastEnders and Top Gear will make net TV mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions, he said.\nOne of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee, said Mr Ayers. As inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT. Mr Allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of \"impossible to regulate\" and \"just apply offline laws online\". In fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content. After Lord Currie departed, the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. \"If content is on-demand, consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them, then it is the consumers' choice to watch it. There is no watershed on the net,\" said Mr Burke.",
    "Hearts manager John Robertson hopes a place in the knock-out stages of the Uefa Cup could help keep some of his out-of-contract players at the club.\n\"It could help. If we get through and have another European tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season,\" he said. \"If we manage to get through it shows how well the club's progressing. \"They have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on.\" A win for Robertson's side against Ferencvaros would put them through to the last 32 if Basle fail to beat Feyenoord. \"It's very much the player's prerogative but the fact that we've been playing European football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive,\" added Robertson. \"But we want players who want to play for the football club, who are committed and a run in Europe always helps a little bit.\" With the game being played at Murrayfield instead of Tynecastle because of Uefa regulations, Robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue.\n\"The pitch is not in the greatest condition. The Heineken Cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is a bit threadbare,\" he said. \"It's not ideal but it's the same for both teams so we just have to go out and there and perform. That's the most important thing.\" But he added: \"If Tynecastle could have hosted 30,000 it would have been fantastic but that's one of the benefits of Murrayfield - it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it. \"There will be a good atmosphere and the Hearts fans have an important role to play. \"We need their encouragement, we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible. \"Hopefully the players will respond to that and I know they will because it's a fantastic European night for the club.\"",
    "A film based on the internet musings of the \"Baghdad Blogger\" has been shown at the Rotterdam Film Festival.\nThe film has been directed by the man who calls himself Salam Pax, the author of the weblog about Iraqi life during and after the war. The movie version comes in the form of a series of shorts made by Pax on a hand-held camera. Baghdad Blogger is among a number of films about Iraq showcased at the Dutch festival, which runs until Sunday. Following the fascination with the writing of Salam Pax - not his real name - he began a regular column in The Guardian newspaper and was given a crash course in documentary film-making. For the film he travelled Iraq to document the changing landscape of the country and the problems it has faced since the invasion, speaking to ordinary Iraqis about their experiences. The festival will also see the screening of Underexposure, one of Iraq's first features to emerge since the toppling of Saddam Hussein.\nDirector Oday Rasheed made the film on discarded 1980s Kodak film taken from the remains for the former Ministry of Culture building. It centres on the lives of families and strangers going about their everyday business as Baghdad is under siege. Rasheed said the title was refers to the isolation felt by Iraqis under Saddam's regime and the difficult time the country is now experiencing. \"Saddam's regime was hell, but now I think the hell has doubled,\" Rasheed said. The festival was also due to screen murdered Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh's film about the treatment of woman under Islam, but it was withdrawn due to safety fears. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed in November 2004, following death threats he received about his film Submission.",
    "The Conservative Party would deal \"sympathetically\" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.\nDr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for \"vindictiveness\" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.\nA jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.\nHe won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. Dr Fox was asked if he would say yes or no if Lord Archer applied to rejoin. \"I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. \"I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell.\"\nTory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. \"After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,\" he added. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. He said: \"I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. But there is no doubt it would be controversial.\" Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.",
    "The creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is to take on a new female superhero after signing up to write and direct the Wonder Woman movie.\nJoss Whedon described the DC Comics character as \"the most iconic female heroine of our time\". \"In a way, no one has met her yet,\" he said. \"What I love most about icons is finding out what's behind them, exploring the price of their power.\" Linda Carter played the character in the 1970s TV series. The character of Wonder Woman, famed for her red and gold costume, was born on Paradise Island, and was blessed with the powers of strength and flight. The film is being produced by Joel Silver, producer of the Matrix trilogy.\n\"There's no one better than Joss to adapt the legendary Wonder Woman comic book character created in the 1940s into a dynamic feature film for 21st Century audiences,\" said Silver. \"Wonder Woman was the first great female superhero to emerge from comic books and later inspire millions of fans in her television incarnation... but this groundbreaking heroine has yet to be reinvented for the feature film arena.\" Whedon created the character of Buffy in the screenplay for the 1992 film. He distanced himself from the movie because of the direction it eventually took, and the film bombed. But he did not give up on the Slayer and went on to write and executive produce seven seasons of the cult TV series. He also produced the spin-off Angel series. He is currently directing the film Serenity, based on his short-lived sci-fi series Firefly.",
    "The prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial, saying \"several hundred\" people in the UK are plotting terror attacks.\nThe government is facing opposition from Tory and Lib Dem MPs and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final Commons debate on the changes. But Tony Blair said there could be no concession on the \"basic principle\". Mr Blair told the BBC the \"control orders\" would only be used in the most limited circumstances. Critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. But the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders, instead saying judges will be able to quash them.\nAn explanation is being sent by Home Secretary Charles Clarke to all MPs and peers ahead of the final debate in the House of Commons. On Sunday, Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders. And Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. Some 32 Labour MPs voted against the legislation last week. Barbara Follett, whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in South Africa during the apartheid era, confirmed she would vote against the government.\nBut the government is continuing to insist that \"control orders\" must be issued by the home secretary. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: \"We are being advised by the police and the security services... \"What they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt. \"And these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances.\"\nA YouGov poll in the Daily Telegraph suggested 75% of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. But Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC News that the government was again making a mistake in \"rushing\" anti-terrorism legislation. \"I very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this.\" He said after meeting Tony Blair he had been left with the impression that \"he really wasn't interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward\". Mr Clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects - something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights. BBC political correspondent Vicky Young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the House of Lords, where Labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties. Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group Liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue. She said the legislation was \"a travesty and a perversion of justice\" and would remain \"unpalatable\" even if a judge was involved early in the process.",
    "Manchester United's Alex Ferguson has praised his players' gutsy performance in the 1-0 win at Aston Villa.\n\"That was our hardest away game of the season and it was a fantastic game of football, end-to-end with lots of good passing,\" said the Old Trafford boss. \"We showed lots of character and guts and we weren't going to lose. \"I look at that fixture and think we've been there and won, while Arsenal and Chelsea have yet to come and Villa may have some players back when they do.\" Ferguson also hailed senior stars Ryan Giggs and Roy Keane, who came off the bench for the injured John O'Shea. \"Roy came on and brought a bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got. \"Giggs was a tremendous threat and he brings tremendous penetration. \"All we can do is maintain our form, play as we are and we'll get our rewards.\"",
    "Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand, who shot to prominence in 2004, have won two Brit Awards.\nWith their self-titled debut, Franz Ferdinand have achieved what most rock bands crave - high credibility and critical acclaim while also selling stacks of CDs. They have risen to the head of the UK's art rock ranks with an album of songs that are catchy, creative and original enough to sound fresh. With a cool, spiky, fun sound previously associated with bands like Talking Heads, they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. Their first UK single hit number three last January, followed by two more top 20 hits, while the album has sold more than 600,000 copies in 11 months on release. In September it was named album of the year winning the prestigious Mercury Music Prize.\nOn the festivals circuit, they have been one of the main attractions for huge crowds at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Reading/Leeds. They have also found success in Japan, Europe and the US. By September the album had sold 500,000 in the States and total sales were pushing two million worldwide. They have been nominated for three Grammy awards in the US as well as the US music industry's Shortlist award, but lost the Shortlist prize to US band TV on the Radio. Nevertheless Franz Ferdinand were the only UK band to win an MTV Video Music Award this year, taking the breakthrough video crown for Take Me Out.\nThe four-piece met two years ago when drummer Paul Thomson was working at the Glasgow art school where bassist Bob Hardy was studying. Singer Alex Kapranos was studying English at university but had friends at art school, and the line-up was completed when guitarist Nick McCarthy moved from Munich, Germany, to the city. At the turn of the year, Kapranos told BBC News Online the band were fed up with serious bands in \"that post-rock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune\".\n\"We want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. But at the same time bringing an edge to it.\" Franz Ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song, Kapranos said. \"Where's the fun in that?\" they pondered at every stage, making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors. The band started out with a DIY ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in Glasgow and rename it The Chateau. The venue soon became legendary - so well-known that the police spent a month trying to find it, eventually raiding it and arresting Kapranos. But the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety, fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped.\nThe band took over an abandoned Victorian courtroom and jail instead, and named that The Chateau. The buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and 40 record labels turned up to one gig in Glasgow - which the band thought was \"totally ridiculous\". \"I'm really glad it was almost comical because we weren't overwhelmed by the seriousness of it,\" Kapranos said. They signed with independent label Domino, home of Smog, Sebadoh and Four Tet, in June 2003.",

    "German business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy.\nMunich-based research institute Ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in February from 97.5 in January, its first decline in three months. The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\n\"We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\nGermany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.",
    "The top civil servant at the centre of the David Blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the New Year Honours.\nSir John Gieve was Home Office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with Mr Blunkett quitting. He and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny came to be fast-tracked. The outgoing head of the troubled Child Support Agency Doug Smith also earns an honour in the New Year's list. Mr Smith, 57, whose retirement was announced by Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Smith in November, is made a Commander of the Order of Bath.\nBoth men were giving evidence to a Commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. The knighting of Sir John, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians.\nThe Liberal Democrats said it \"beggared belief\" he and fellow officials could not remember how Leoncia Casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain went from Mr Blunkett's office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department. Meanwhile, the Conservatives accused officials of a \"collective failure\" of memory. But Sir Alan Budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.\nDowning Street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: \"You have to look at their whole career.\" Sir John was made permanent secretary in April 2001 following a Civil Service career which dates back to 1974. He has also worked in the Treasury and the Department of Employment. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said of Mr Smith's honour: \"The award reflects all that he has achieved in a Civil Service career, principally in the Inland Revenue, spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the Child Support Agency.\n\"In his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes.\" Mr Smith is set to stay on at the CSA until March. Less controversial will be the knighthoods for Derek Wanless and Mike Tomlinson, who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively. Former NatWest chief executive Mr Wanless, 57, has delivered not one but two major reports on the NHS. Ex-chief inspector of schools Mr Tomlinson, 62, has recommended replacing A-Levels and GCSEs with a new diploma system in a shake-up of the exams system.",
    "Scarlets and USA Eagles forward Dave Hodges has ended his playing career to pursue a coaching role in the States.\nThe 36-year-old, who has 54 caps, was Llanelli's player of the season in 2001/2, but has battled injury for the last two of his seven years at Stradey. He tore a pectoral muscle against the Ospreys on Boxing Day, an injury that would have kept him out for the season. \"Realising I would be unable to play this season, the club and I agreed to end my contract early,\" said Hodges.\n\"It allows me to move back to the US and pursue opportunities there and allows the Scarlets to look to the next generation.\" The Scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing Heineken Cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks.\nScarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher confirmed that 17 of the current squad would be out of contract in the summer. \"We have a deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they won't all be re-signed, it's a chance to invigorate the squad,\" he said. \"I'm positive about the future of the Scarlets both on and off the field.\" Gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back-five forward Hodges has played at Stradey Park, though. \"David has been a highly influential member of our squad for seven years,\" said Gallacher. \"He is a real professional and we thank him for the part he has played in our success. \"I am sure he has an enormous contribution to make to the development of rugby in the US and we wish him and his family well.\" Hodges described his years at Stradey as \"the best time of my life.\"",
    "Rap mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight has been arrested for violating his parole after he was allegedly found with marijuana.\nHe was arrested in Barstow, California, on Saturday following an alleged traffic offence. He is expected to be transferred to a state prison while a decision is made on whether he should be released. Mr Knight, founder of Death Row Records, served a 10-month jail term in 2004 for punching a man while on parole for an assault conviction. Police said Mr Knight was stopped on Saturday after performing an illegal U-turn and a search of his car allegedly found marijuana.\nHe is also accused of not having insurance. A 18-year-old woman in the car was arrested for providing false information and having a fake ID card. She was later released. It was his second alleged violation, having previously served half of a nine-year sentence for breaking the terms of his parole. Mr Knight, 39, was jailed in October 1996 following his involvement in a fight with a rival gang just hours before rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in a Las Vegas drive-by shooting. He was driving Shakur's car at the time and was shot in the head. At the time he was on probation for assaulting two musicians. Mr Knight, a former bodyguard, set up Death Row records in the early 1990s with Shakur and Dr Dre among his protegees. But the label has always been dogged by allegations it supports gang culture and fuels the east and west coast rap rivalry.",
    "South Korea's Hyundai Motor has announced that it plans to build a second plant in India to meet the country's growing demand for cars.\nThe company didn't give details of its investment but it said the new plant would produce 150,000 cars a year. This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. Hyundai expects its sales in India to grow 16% to 250,000 in 2005. By 2010, it expects to nearly double sales to 400,000 cars. The new plant will be built close to the existing one in Chennai, in the southern province of Tamil Nadu.\nSouth Korea's top car maker estimates that the Indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1.6 million vehicles by 2010. Demand in India has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. Figures show that currently only eight people per thousand are car owners. \"We desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the Indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors,\" chairman Chung Mong-koo said in the statement. He said the company plans to use India as a base for exports to Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The company - which controls half of the South Korean's market - aims to become a global top five auto maker by 2010.",
    "The remaining members of rock band Queen are to go on tour next year with former Free and Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers taking Freddie Mercury's place.\nGuitarist Brian May has said he expects to be on the road with Rodgers and drummer Roger Taylor from April. May said: \"Suddenly the Queen Phoenix is rising again from the ashes and will take precedence over... our lives.\" Queen have played with many different singers since Mercury's death in 1991 but have reportedly not toured. May performed with Rodgers at a concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar in London in September.\n\"We were both so amazed at the chemistry that was going on in [Free hit] All Right Now, that suddenly it seems blindingly obvious that there was 'something happening here,'\" May wrote on his website. They teamed up again for a concert to mark their induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and were joined by Taylor. \"The show went so incredibly well from our point of view, and we got so many rave reactions from out there, we decided almost then and there that we would look at a tour together,\" May wrote.\nQueen went to number one in 2000 with a version of We Will Rock You sung by boy band 5ive and they have also played with Robbie Williams, Will Young and Bob Geldof. Queen bassist John Deacon has currently retired from the stage. Rodgers was singer with early 1970s rockers Free, who had a global hit with All Right Now, before forming Bad Company, a successful \"supergroup\" with members of King Crimson and Mott the Hoople. He has also been in The Firm with Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and The Law with The Small Faces and The Who drummer Kenny Jones.",
    "Jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant Yukos to a business partner.\nMr Khodorkovsky handed over his entire 59.5% stake in holding company Group Menatep - which controls Yukos - to Leonid Nevzlin. A close ally of the ex-Yukos boss, Mr Nevzlin is currently based in Israel. Mr Khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of Yukos' core oil production unit, Yuganskneftegaz to pay a giant tax bill.\nYuganskneftegaz was sold off at auction in December last year, eventually falling into the hands of state oil firm Rosneft in a deal worth $9.4bn (£5bn). \"Since the sale of Yuganskneftegaz, I have been delivered of (all) responsibility for the business that remains and the group's money as a whole,\" Mr Khodorkovsky said. \"It is all over. As before, I see my future in public activity to build a civil society in Russia.\" Mr Nevzlin is Yukos' largest shareholder but is living in self-imposed exile in Israel. Yuganskneftegaz pumps around 1 million barrels of oil a day. It was sold by the Russian authorities to recover government tax claims against Yukos totalling over $27bn. Previously considered to be Russia's richest man, with an estimated fortune of $15bn, Mr Khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in October 2003. However, the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs. It is also believed that Mr Khodorkovsky was particularly targeted because he had started to bankroll political opponents of Mr Putin.",
    "India's biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos.\n\"We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia,\" said ONGC chairman Subir Raha. Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos' former key oil production unit for $2bn (£1bn). Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.\nIt was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.\nState-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGC's plans during a trip to Moscow last year, and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putin's recent visit to New Delhi. \"It would make great sense for us to build on that,\" said Mr Aiyar. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. At the same time, India's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.\nIndia produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\n\"For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,\" said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India is a \"dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil\". By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. \"We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline,\" Mr Westwood said. \"By 2020, production may only be at half of today's levels.\" ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russia's Siberian coast.\nONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk.\nChinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on Thursday, Italy refused to rule out an interest. ONGC's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.",
    "Online role playing games are time-consuming, but enthralling flights from reality. But are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously?\nWhen video game World of Warcraft hit the shops in Europe last week fans wrote in to the BBC website to express their delight - and to offer a warning. \"An addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time,\" wrote Travis Anderson, in Texas. Some of the comments were humorous: \"This game is so good I'm not going to get it, there's no way I could limit the hours I'd spend playing it,\" wrote Charles MacIntyre, from England.\nBut some struck a more worrying tone about the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG): \"'You need to get out more' could be the motto of any MMORPG. Shame they are getting more popular, as you know this problem is just going to mushroom,\" wrote Stuart Stanton-Davies, in Huddersfield. Scare-mongering articles about \"addictive video games\" have existed since the days the first game of Pong stopped everyone from working at the Atari offices.\nGaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym, in front of the television, or reading poetry.\nUnfortunately, gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make. However, stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent. And the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some.\nMassively multiplayer online role playing games - MMORPGs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds. The scope of these games - like Warcraft, EverQuest, Ultima among others - is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite. Part of the \"problem\" is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded, mindless tasks, to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure. Such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing; not for no reason is EverQuest (EQ) nicknamed EverCrack. E Hayot, writing in the culture blogzine Print Culture, said recently: \"I used to play the online role-playing game EverQuest a lot. \"By 'a lot', I mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average, and on weeks where I didn't have to work, as many as 30 or 40 hours.\"\nHe says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour \"wasn't that unusual; lots of people I knew in the game played EQ that much\". \"You lie; you don't go into work because you \"had stuff to do at home\"; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner, you spend much less time watching TV (a good thing, presumably),\" he wrote, explaining how EverQuest took over his time. He quit the game, he says, because he realised life was more fun than EverQuest.\nLet us be clear - such obsession is rare. But the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far. Almost 400,000 people bought a copy of World of Warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month. Only a fraction will descend into obsessives. The thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by EverQuest can be found on one blog EverQuest Daily Grind. Jane, who runs the website, compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories. \"I am actually convinced at this point that there are more than 'some' people who spend more times in MMOPRGs than in reality,\" she said. One unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote: \"On the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as I do, I find that I am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me.\n\"I can't talk to him while he is playing. There is absolutely no point as he doesn't hear me or is so distracted that I get a 'ummm... ya' a few minutes after I ask him a question.\"\n\"Gaming widows\" has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers. But for some it is not in the least funny. Another correspondent wrote: \"I believe that he is addicted to the online gaming, and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness.\" And some of them are even sadder: \"Today our son was five days old. \"The sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his Warcraft game. He did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online.\" Video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised. But as gaming becomes ever more mainstream, and games ever more immersive, there will be no hiding place for social problems.\nI wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but I think it probably isn't. An 11 hour stretch isn't that surprising - I've known people to play 15+ hours at a stretch. I know of people who are spending their week's holiday from work playing Warcraft. I know of people who would play Ever[Crack] in shifts...waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they 'needed' to appear. I understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life. By all standards many of us are addicts. So is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing..or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting?\nSadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming, I find myself longing to have the time to join them. I have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began, games have become more and more complex. And more and more so I find I have less and less time to play them, with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time.\nI think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct. I play games a lot, definately over 20 hours a week, but I don't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.\nI have, about a year ago, deleted every game on my computer. RPGs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword. Unlike books, or perhaps even TV, you gain absolutely nothing. When you stop playing you're at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and, since you've gained nothing in the real world, you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.\nDespite having little monetary value, the \"rewards\" and encouragement offered by these MMORPGs is enough to hook games for hours daily. If only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition. Perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality?\nMy advice to gaming widows is \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\". That is, try playing it yourself. If he wants to play as well, well at least you'll be together somewhere...\nI was an addict and it cost me my relationship. I still play now, but without the guilt , hehe, How long have i played in one sitting? From morning till the early hours of the next day, the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain, i would hardly eat, perhaps some toast, smoke endlessly and drink. Now, thankfully the fascination has worn off and I have a girlfriend but still no job. For the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement, and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate.\nObsessive behaviour is, of course, always cause for concern, but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of \"reality\". Obviously, somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing EverQuest has a problem. This problem, however, has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality. An obsessive EQ player does not consider the game to be \"real\" any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human. If MMORPGs have a unique danger, in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour, it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world, but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7. The problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming, but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture.\nThe problem with these so called MMORPGS is that you can never really complete them, there's always another quest to do. A few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday...\nChampionship Manager consumed my life for years. One particular session started at about 2pm on a Sunday, paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the Monday and after visit to University for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session. The people who tend to hark on about about the problems of \"hardcore gaming\" seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game. I would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that.\nI used to be an EverQuest addict while I was in college. It came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one. I failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate. I was lucky that I came to my senses when I did, others were less fortunate and dropped out of college. Now that I am holding a job, I avoid online RPGS like the plague.\nWhen I was made redundant I told my partner I had a new job for three months whilst every day I played EverQuest from 7:30am till 5:pm. When She came home I pretended I had just got in as well, hence justifying playing it all evening. I have since quit playing MMORPG and have a good job.\nWhen I got to the point where I was eating my dinner in front of the PC I realised things were getting silly so I'm trying not to spend so much time on there. It's not easy. I feel as if I've got a real addiction going on here.\nFor me the problem is that I love to complete a goal. Once it is completed that is it, I am finished, time to move on. I become obsessed to complete the goal, so from that standpoint it is an addiction. In a game where you will never complete an \"ultimate\" goal, well it would be like falling into a black pit. It is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the PC game are \"easier\" and more fun than the real world. Pretty scary implications if you think about it.\nI can't buy World of Warcraft as it would destroy my marrage, I just know it!!\nI played Star Wars Galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games. They are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly, but this progress becomes exponentially slower, requiring more and more time to reach the next level. I'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction I was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor, slowly building up my character, stopping only for food and toilet breaks. Thankfully I made a clean break, and actually managed to sell my Jedi account for £800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum.\nSeven years ago, I began playing Ultima Online. This game dominated 2 years of my life. They were 2 wonderful years and I still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends I had. Online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others. Something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life. Whilst I would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games, I believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching TV.\nGaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction. When I was single I used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year, building up my stats, completing evermore quests and battling ogres. But somehow I found time to get out, even met someone and got married! Has my life changed? Hell no! I still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning. On with the fun!\nOnline gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.\nMany people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families, relationships and good careers. A minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted. According to this article the same is true of MMORPGs. The message to the government is clear, either legalise drugs, or outlaw online gaming!!\nSounds like there are some sad stories here - and I can believe them all. I play alot of Warcraft myself, and know full well how addictive it is. I am resolute that it will not take over my life. It certainly gets in the way though. I think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line, or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it.\nI think I'm obsessed with gaming in general, I spend far too much time playing games like Everquest 2 and Football Manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when I do try to, I'm always thinking in the back if my mind that I'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with Cambridge United.\nI am obsessed with online role playing games. It's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc. I spend about five hours per day online playing it and I rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning...\nAs many of the players spend their time in MMORPGs rather than in front of the TV I fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively. Furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect, whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature.\nThese games are like most things -- too much of anything is a bad thing, but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too, they can be great fun.\nLiving in Korea at the moment, they have lots PC Bangs (Internet Cafes). Nearly most of South Koreans are addicted to online games, and one Korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games.\nI play xbox live every day. I find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix. The longest I played was a 24 hour straight session. I know I play for to long but it's an obsession that I can't control. Can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up... but something I'm increasingly concerned with...\nMe and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a TV, trying to 'frag' some individual. It's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming, and enjoying 'real' life...\nI bought the US version of World of Warcraft when it came out. The longest period I played was 23 hrs straight. I gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive, but have subsequently just bought the European version (couldn't help myself). In future, I'm going to regulate my time far more strictly. Great game!\nHaving played MMORPG games for some years I agree that these type of games can be life sucking. But my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment. Most MMORPG games you need a credit card to play but I dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.\nUnless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person&#191;s health, you can expect this not to decline but to get worse.\nThese people are pathetic. They need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and \"online universe\" absolutely meaningless.\n24hours, when i was a kid at school and i was on half term, Ultima Online was the game, ahhhh them was the days ! LOL",
    "A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.\nFears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a £10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.\nThere were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. \"While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,\" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be £10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.\nEven without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.\nThe report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: \"There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. \"Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. \"The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.\" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.",
    "England have named Bath prop Matt Stevens in the starting line-up for their Six Nations match against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on Sunday.\nFellow Bath prop Duncan Bell will start on the bench, as coach Andy Robinson makes just one change to the team that was beaten by France. It will be Stevens' first start after two caps as a replacement against the All Blacks last year. Leicester duo Ollie Smith and Andy Goode have been drafted onto the bench. Stevens takes over from Phil Vickery, who suffered a broken arm playing for Gloucester last weekend. \"I'm confident Matt will grasp this opportunity and make his mark against Ireland,\" said Robinson.\n\"All three players have shown outstanding form of late, most recently in the England A win against France A and for their club,\" added Robinson. \"Selection beckons when players demonstrate such consistent ability. \"This game against Ireland will be massive. We recognise it's a must-win game for us this season.\" England confirmed that Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan was not considered for selection because of an injury he picked up to the back of his ankle during last Friday's match against Leeds.\nJ Robinson (Sale Sharks, capt); M Cueto (Sale Sharks), J Noon (Newcastle), O Barkley (Bath), J Lewsey (Wasps); C Hodgson (Sale Sharks), H Ellis (Leicester); G Rowntree (Leicester), S Thompson (Northampton), M Stevens (Bath), D Grewcock (Bath), B Kay (Leicester), J Worsley (Wasps), L Moody (Leicester), M Corry (Leicester).\nA Titterrell (Sale Sharks), D Bell (Bath), S Borthwick (Bath), A Hazell (Gloucester), M Dawson (Wasps), A Goode (Leicester), O Smith (Leicester).",
    "Rangers are set to loan out-of-favour midfielder Dragan Mladenovic to Real Sociedad, despite the closure of the January transfer window.\nSociedad have been given special permission by the Spanish FA to sign a player due to an injury crisis. Mladenovic will effectively replace former Rangers midfielder Mikel Arteta, who has been loaned to Everton. Sociedad say they will pay Rangers £150,000, with an option to buy the Serbia & Montenegro international. Mladenovic's loan move is subject to him passing a medical. The 28-year-old, who joined Rangers from Red Star Belgrade for £1.2m in the close season, is expected in San Sebastian later this week following his national side's game against Bulgaria. Sociedad are in 15th place in the 20-strong Primera Liga, just two points above the relegation zone. Special permission from the Spanish FA came after an injury to central defender Igor Jauregi. The versatile Mladenovic can also play in the back four. His agent said last month that Rangers had told him to find the player a new club. Mladenovic's time at Ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the Glasgow club.",
    "Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\nLabour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\nOn Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\nUKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\nUKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.",
    "The US looks set for a continued boost to interest rates in 2005, according to the Federal Reserve.\nMinutes of the December meeting which pushed rates up to 2.25% showed that policy-makers at the Fed are worried about accelerating inflation. The clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 GMT on Wednesday, but depressed US shares. \"The markets are starting to fear a more aggressive Fed in 2005,\" said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research. The Dow Jones index dropped almost 100 points on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq also falling as key tech stocks were hit by broker downgrades. The dollar also gained ground against sterling on Tuesday, reaching $1.8832 to the pound before slipping slightly on Wednesday morning.\nThe release of the minutes just three weeks after the 14 December meeting was much faster than usual, indicating the Fed wants to keep markets more apprised of its thinking. This, too, is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come. The key Fed funds rate has risen 1.25 percentage points during 2004 from the 46-year low of 1% reached not long after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. That long trough \"might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets\", said the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates. The odds now favour a further boost to rates at the next meeting in early February, economists said. But the respite for the dollar, which spent late 2003 being pushed lower against other major currencies by worries about massive US trade and budget deficits, may be short-lived. \"You can't rule out a further correction... but we don't think it's a change in direction in the dollar,\" said Jason Daw at Merrill Lynch. \"Nothing fundamental has changed.\"",
    "The Office's Ricky Gervais is writing an episode of hit US cartoon The Simpsons, following an invitation from its creator Matt Groening.\nGervais has already begun writing the script but is keeping its subject matter a closely guarded secret. He will also write a part for himself in the episode. \"I've got the rough idea but this is the most intimidating project of my career. The Simpsons is the greatest TV show of all time,\" he said. Groening recently heaped praise on The Office, saying: \"Everybody on The Simpsons is a fan of The Office - it's one of the best shows on TV in the last decade.\" Gervais has already said he would not guest star in the show as his Office character David, having left him behind for good in the Christmas specials. The Office became a surprise US success when it was screened on cable channel BBC America. The first series won two Golden Globes in 2004 for best comedy and best TV actor for Gervais.\nIn winning it beat the likes of Sex and the City and Will and Grace. An American version was produced, but so far only a pilot has been broadcast - to much criticism that it failed to live up to the original. At the British Comedy Awards on Wednesday, Gervais was handed a special achievement award for writing. But The Office missed out in the best comedy show category to Little Britain. Matt Groening was also at the awards to collect the award for best international comedy for The Simpsons.",
    "Fans who buy tickets for this year's Glastonbury festival will be issued with photo ID cards in an attempt to beat touts, it has been confirmed.\nThe cards will include a photograph of the ticket-holder plus an electronic chip with their details to prevent tickets being sold on or forged. Tickets for the June event are expected to go on sale in April. \"There is only one place in the world where you will be able to get tickets,\" festival organiser Michael Eavis said. \"That will be the official source. If you get them anywhere else, you won't get in.\" Fans not wanting to carry the entrance card could present their passport or driving licence instead, he added.\nMore than 153,000 people are expected to travel to Mr Eavis' Somerset farm from 24-26 June, but the event's rising popularity has meant an extremely high demand for tickets in recent years. When the ID card idea was floated, Mr Eavis' daughter Emily said it would be \"quite a big step in terms of ticketing for events\" if implemented and they were \"going as far as we can\" to cut touting. \"As long as it's approached in the right way, it might really work, it might really change the system,\" she said. In 2004, all 112,000 tickets for the public sold out in 24 hours. They were personalised with the names of purchasers, who were asked to bring identification, such as a driving licence, passport or household bill. But some forgot to take the right information while some touts simply offered to supply their own bills along with the ticket bearing their name. No details of this year's line-up have been confirmed but rumours have suggested U2 and Coldplay may be among the headliners.",
    "Ireland consigned England to their third straight Six Nations defeat with a stirring victory at Lansdowne Road.\nA second-half try from captain Brian O'Driscoll and 14 points from Ronan O'Gara kept Ireland on track for their first Grand Slam since 1948. England scored first through Martin Corry but had \"tries\" from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey disallowed. Andy Robinson's men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 World Cup final. The defeat also heralded England's worst run in the championship since 1987. Ireland last won the title, then the Five Nations, in 1985, but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with Wales. And Eddie O'Sullivan's side banished the ghosts of 2003 when England were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the Grand Slam at Lansdowne Road. In front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in Dublin, Ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when O'Gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.\nEngland took their time to settle but their first real venture into Ireland's half produced a simple score for Corry. The number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the Irish line, racing 25 yards to touch down. England fly-half Charlie Hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately O'Gara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalties in quick succession. England were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes, and Hodgson, the villain at Twickenham, coolly bisected the posts. The first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking, but it was Ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. A series of probes led by the talismanic O'Driscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but Ireland chose to kick for touch.\nFrom the line-out, the ball was recycled back to O'Gara, who stroked his second drop-goal, this time off the right upright. As the interval approached, wing Josh Lewsey was the catalyst for England's most promising attack. The Wasps star raced up his touchline and Hodgson's cross-kick put in Mark Cueto for an apparent score, but the Sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. England began the second half well and had Ireland pinned in their own half. But another English indiscretion on a rare Irish break-out awarded O'Gara a kick at goal, which he missed. England's pressure continued, and a wave of attacks saw centre Jamie Noon dragged down yards from the line before Hodgson landed a drop-goal.\nThe lead was shortlived, however. Ireland raced upfield, deft handling from the backs, including a clever dummy from Geordan Murphy on Hodgson, ending with O'Driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. O'Gara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgson's cross-kick was fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line. Anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high, but O'Gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. Inside the last 10 minutes, England poured forward, spurred on by scrum-half Matt Dawson, who replaced Leicester's Harry Ellis. But despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the TV replay by referee Jonathan Kaplan - England were unable to pull off a face-saving win. Ireland next face France at Lansdowne Road in two weeks' time before the potential title decider against Wales in Cardiff.

    "Aston Villa boss David O'Leary signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension on Thursday, securing his future at the club until summer 2008.\nO'Leary's future was in question, but Villa chairman Doug Ellis said he was happy to secure the deal. \"David's record since his arrival in 2003 is excellent and he shares the board's amibitions in taking this club forward,\" he told Villa's website. \"For this reason it was important we got this right.\" O'Leary put pen to paper after deals were sorted for his right-hand men Roy Aitken and Steve McGregor. \"It was important to me Roy and Steve, an integral part of my team, should stay for the same time,\" O'Leary said on Thursday ahead of signing his new deal. \"Someone has to try and put Aston Villa back where they should belong and I'm up for the challenge.\"Earlier in December, there were rumours O'Leary would quit if he is not offered a new deal before the end of the season.\nBut he denied that, saying he was happy to take on the challenge of improving Villa's fortunes in the long term. \"I want to make sure by the end of the five years I would have been in charge that Villa are achieving top six finishes in the Premiership on a regular basis,\" said O'Leary, who took over at Villa Park in May 2003. \"But to achieve that, and take the next step forward, we do need to bring in quality players. \"I would like a couple next month if at all possible to set us on the way.\" Meanwhile, O'Leary has rapped skipper Olof Mellberg for his comments before Sunday's derby with Birmingham.\nMellberg spoke of his dislike of Villa's rivals ahead of the match, which Steve Bruce's side won 2-1. \"I've had more than a quiet word with Olof. It's been said within the whole group, not as a one-to-one,\" he told Villa's website. \"You shouldn't leave yourself open to be shot down. You shouldn't give people the chance to take cheap shots at you and he set himself up for that.\"",
    "Kim Clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of January's Australian Open because of her persistent wrist injury.\nOpen chief Paul McNamee had said: \"Kim's wrist obviously isn't going to be rehabilitated.\" But her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry. \"The doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. But if there's the least risk she will stay away.\" Despite being absent from the WTA entry list for the tournament, which begins on 17 January, Clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. Clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. The Belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. Meanwhile, Jelena Dokic, who used to compete for Australia, has opted out of the first Grand Slam of the season. Dokic has not played in the Australian Open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. But the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. Four-time champion Monica Seles, who has not played since last year's French Open, is another absentee because of an injured left foot.",
    "The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.\nPoliticians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.\nHugo Lueders, European director for public policy at CompTIA, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration.",

    "Marion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe Sydney Olympic gold medallist says Conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: \"I stand by everything I said\". Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she \"has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs\". Conte's statements, the suit added, were \"false and malicious\". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: \"Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. \"Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America's most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte's statements have been wildly contradictory. \"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.\n\"Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.\" The sport's ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte's allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte \"for further information\". But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte's television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.",
    "Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said his side's task against AC Milan would not be made any easier by the absence of Andriy Shevchenko.\nMilan's talismanic European footballer of the year misses Wednesday's Champions League first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone. \"It's a loss (to Milan), but it could be worse if they didn't have such quality to bring in,\" Ferguson said. \"How much they miss him I think they'll know tomorrow night.\" Ferguson said Milan's front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders. \"They can play Rui Costa and play Kaka forward. They can bring Serginho in and they can play (Jon Dahl) Tomasson,\" he said. Ferguson's own goalscoring talisman Ruud van Nistelrooy is fit again, but the Scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the Dutchman, who has not played for three months.\n\"Ruud is the best striker in Europe. What I have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long,\" he said. \"His ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision.\" Ferguson, though, is confident his young players, particularly Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, are up to the task. \"We have an opportunity to win this cup this year, no question about that,\" he declared. \"With the maturity we see every week in Ronaldo and Rooney, the return of Van Nistelrooy and the form of Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, we must have a fantastic chance.\" It is a view shared by Rooney, who believes \"if we can get past Milan, we have a great chance\". \"As soon as I knew we were playing Milan, I got excited. Looking at the draw, it is anyone's trophy but we have every chance. \"Hopefully, we can get to that final in Turkey and bring the cup back to Manchester.\" Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted Europe's most prestigious club title two seasons ago. Milan beat Juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at Old Trafford and Ancelotti said: \"We are all very happy to return (to Old Trafford) to play in the Champions League and this will give us great motivation.\" Ancelotti said he was aware of the threat United posed to his hopes of Champions League glory. \"It's fundamental that we don't allow them to take control of the game.

    "Georgia is offering a one-off 'tax amnesty' to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze.\nThe country's new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax. The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia's flagging economy. Georgia's black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.\nMr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era, and boost Georgia's fragile public finances.\nThe new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected. \"There are people who have money but are afraid to show it,\" the president told a government session. \"Documentation about where this money came from doesn't exist because under the former, entirely warped regime, earning capital honestly was not possible.\"\nBy declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to \"legalise their property\", Mr Saakashvili stressed.\n\"No one will have the right to check this money's origin. This money must go back into the economy.\" The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of Georgian businesses -are to continue. Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in November, of allowing bribery to flourish. Georgia's economy is in a desperate condition. Half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4, or three euros, a day.

    "The reported feud between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has prompted a Labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.\nDuncan Bannatyne also attacked the government over Iraq and its \"poor\" response to the Asian tsunami crisis. His broadside came as ex-Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he hoped Mr Brown would be premier at some point. Mr Bannatyne has previously given Labour £50,000. He made his fortune from care homes and health clubs.\nThe 52-year-old on Tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of Cabinet disunity and international issues. His spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give Labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the Conservatives.\nRobert Peston's new book has prompted more speculation about the Blair-Brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. Mr Bannatyne said: \"Disunity in the Cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country. \"Gordon Brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy, but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition.\" The businessman, whose latest venture is a casino in Newcastle, also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in Iraq.\nAnd he branded the UK government's response to the tsunami as \"piecemeal and poor\". \"The people there need practical help not just pledges of money,\" he said. \"The US has forces helping on the ground - we can do more.\" British Navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. Mr Bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on BBC2 business start-up programme Dragon's Den. But his spokesman insisted his attack on Labour was not a publicity stunt.\nIn a separate development, Robin Cook gave his support to Mr Brown's prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be Labour's election. But he insisted the recent squabbles between Mr Blair and Mr Brown were not \"perceived as a problem by the voters,\" adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. Mr Cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was \"not an alternative source of opposition to the government\". He warned the \"Abstentions Party\" was the real challenge to Labour - and they would not be motivated by Mr Blair's promise to produce an \"unremittingly New Labour\" election manifesto. His comments come after Dave Prentis, the leader of Britain's biggest union Unison, told the Daily Record newspaper he wants a date to be set for Mr Blair to be replaced as Labour leader.",
    "Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange.\nSpeaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai, he said a full listing was \"one of the options\" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium. The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.\nWhen Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time. The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing. \"When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,\" Mr Dein said.\n\"Listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. \"We want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), Manchester United have been a success.\"\nMr Dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. Since the formation of the Premier League in season 1992/93, Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. \"Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition. \"We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline, and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too. \"I think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes I think less is more.\"\nThe club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium. It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets, including Asia. \"We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs, and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too, as they are around the world. \"We have got a very good product, so it is very important we go and look at these markets, and make sure we are on the case.\"",

Mind you, every time she breaks the record she gets $30,000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes. She looked good and was very positive. Agnes Samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly. My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid. He started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.\nIt would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis-Francis could have done in the final, if only he hadn't got himself disqualified. He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. My view is you're meant to go when the gun goes and not before. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. Having said that, Mark is looking in much better shape. But I haven't seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans. From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.\nSomething else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships. Scotland's Lee McConnell is probably going to run too, so we have a real prospect of a medal. From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great. Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money. She had a go but just could not hang in there. We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape. As for Kenenisa Bekele, he was well beaten by Markos Geneti. But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season. It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.",
    "Film star Robert De Niro has returned to the top of the North American box office with his film Hide and Seek.\nThe thriller shot straight to the number one spot after taking $22m (£11.7m) at the box office. De Niro recently spent three weeks at the top with comedy Meet The Fockers, which was at number five this week. Oscar hopefuls The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Sideways all cashed in on their multiple nominations with stronger ticket sales.\nIn Hide and Seek, De Niro plays a widower whose daughter has a creepy imaginary friend. Despite lukewarm reviews from critics, the film took more than the expected $18m (£9.5m). \"The element of a real actor in a psychological thriller certainly elevated it,\" said Bruce Snyder, president of domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox. Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby led the Oscar hopefuls with $11.8m (£6.3m), coming in at number three during its first weekend of wide release. The Aviator, a film biography of Howard Hughes that leads the Oscar field with 11 nominations, was at number six for the weekend with $7.5m (£4m). Oscar best-picture nominee Sideways entered the top ten for the first time in its 15th week of release. It came in seventh $6.3 (£3.35m). Last week's top film, Ice Cube's road-trip comedy Are We There Yet?, slipped to second place with $17m (£9m), while Coach Carter fell two places to number four, taking $8m (£4.25m) in its third week. Rounding out the top ten were In Good Company - starring Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson - Racing Stripes and Assault on Precinct 13.",
    "Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini will miss Sunday's Carling Cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against Newcastle.\nThe Italian was sent off for bringing down Shola Ameobi in the final minute of Sunday's match. Blues boss Jose Mourinho had promised to pick Cudicini for the final instead of first-choice keeper Petr Cech. The 31-year-old will now serve a one-match suspension commencing with immediate effect.\nCudicini kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for Chelsea, but Petr Cech has established himself as first choice for Mourinho since moving to Stamford Bridge in summer 2004. The 22-year-old Czech Republic international has set a new Premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal, a mark which is still running. But Mourinho has used Cudicini regularly in the Carling Cup, and the Italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during Chelsea's run to the final.",
    "TV, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.\nIt is called high-definition - HD for short - and it is already hugely popular in Japan and the US. It is set, according to analysts, to do for images what CDs did for sound. Different equipment able to receive HD signals is needed though and is expensive. But Europe's gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. Europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream HDTV.\nTo view it, it needs to be transmitted in HD format, and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. The next generation of consoles, however, are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005, start of 2006. And most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures. \"In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory,\" Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website. \"Every game is going to be playable in HD. \"So consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on HDTVs, and who have no content to watch, are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures. \"It's going to change really the way they look at gaming.\"\nAt the end of last year, Chris Deering, Sony's European president, made a prediction that 20 million European households would have HDTV sets by 2008. A previous prediction from analysts Datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003. But those in Europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. Satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006 and the BBC intends to produce all of its content in HD by 2010.\nUntil broadcast rights, format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed, TV content will be limited. All TV images are made up of pixels which go across the screen, and scan lines which go down the screen. Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. HD offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. This means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard TV. \"Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this TV can do', until HD is really adopted by broadcasters,\" explains Dr Tuffy. But gamers are also the ideal target audience for HD because they always crave better quality graphics, and more immersive gaming experiences. They are used to spending money on hardware to match a game's requirements. Demographics have changed too and the \"sweet spot\" for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. This means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen, high-definition display technologies and HD projectors, earlier than others.\nHigher capacity storage discs, such as HD-DVD and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.\nFor console developers though, HD offers some production changes. It could make games production slightly more expensive, thinks Dr Tuffy. \"But we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console,\" he says. \"You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD. \"And the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game, just now they have almost got it seamless.\" With HD, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. This could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. But it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. At that point, says Dr Tuffy, games could become more or less interactive movies.",
    "Has there been a better Six Nations match than Saturday's epic in Paris?\nAnd can the Welsh revival continue all the way to a first Grand Slam since 1978? Those are the two questions occupying not just Wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in Paris. Welsh legend Mervyn Davies, a member of two of three Grand Slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as \"one of the great performances of the past three decades\". Martyn Williams, Wales' two-try scorer on the day, called it \"one of the most surreal games I have ever played in\". A crestfallen France coach, Bernard Laporte, simply observed: \"There was a French half and there was a Welsh half\". And what a half it was for the Red Dragonhood, transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. But while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure, the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this Welsh side. That they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time, then reverse it on the resumption, was remarkable enough. But in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of French pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes, Wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.\nIn international rugby, any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day, but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. England suffered some infamous Six Nations disappointments en route to World Cup glory, the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. Wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. But the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. Ten of the 22 on duty on Saturday were also involved when Wales were trounced 33-5 in Paris two years ago. But since they threw off the shackles against New Zealand in the 2003 World Cup, Wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.\n\"The confidence in the squad has been building and building since the World Cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class,\" noted coach Mike Ruddock. The likes of Michael Owen, Gethin Jenkins, Dwayne Peel and Gavin Henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer's Lions tour to New Zealand. And players like Stephen Jones, Martyn Williams, Shane Williams and Gareth Thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. Jones, after his superb man-of-the-match display, observed that \"we are a very happy camp now\". Ruddock and Thomas can take much of the credit for that, ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred Welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. The\njoie de vivre\nso evident in that magical second-half spell in Paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.\nIf England had half the innate attacking exuberance Wales have produced in this championship, they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. Similarly, Wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches, and that forward power, mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. So on to Murrayfield, where Wales have not won on their last three visits. While the hype in the Principality will go into overdrive, the players will set about the task of beating Scotland. Only then - with the visit of Ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s, and writing their own names into Welsh legend.",
    "The Conservatives have been \"a lot smarter\" in the way they have conducted the general election campaign, a Labour backbencher has said.\nDerek Wyatt said having a five month campaign \"turned off voters\" and suggested people were already \"rather bored of the thing\". He wants a greater campaigning role for Chancellor Gordon Brown. Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role. But Mr Wyatt argued: \"By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. \"So, it would be a tad foolish of the Labour Party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections.\"\nLabour's election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda. However, Mr Wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget. The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been \"trying very hard\" to improve his own standing with the electorate through a \"sort of campaign of trust\". But Mr Blair had been \"hurt\" by the Iraq controversy, he added. A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role. \"This election is a choice between Labour taking Britain forward and the Conservatives taking us back.\"",
    "Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in Parliament.\nTories, Lib Dems and some Labour MPs are poised to vote against the plans. Mr Clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. Opponents say only judges, not politicians, should be able to order detention of UK citizens. The government is expected to win Wednesday's vote in the Commons, but faces a battle in the House of Lords.\nThe Prevention of Terrorism Bill was published on Tuesday. It proposes \"control orders\", which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases, and curfews, electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.\nThe two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary, rather than a judge. Tory shadow home secretary David Davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice, like the Guildford Four - for which Tony Blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects. \"Those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that's why we have serious concerns abut that approach,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nMr Clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. He also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. The foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at London's Belmarsh prison. They are held under laws which the Law Lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 March.\nThe new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the Law Lords' concerns, would apply to British as well as foreign terror suspects. Critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive UK citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. Opposition MPs are also angry they will have only two days - Wednesday and next Monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the House of Lords. But the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently.\nIn a rare move, the Tories and Lib Dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill, saying the house arrest plans are \"excessive\". It argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan \"wrongly infringes the right to liberty\" by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. Mr Davis told Today: \"It gives a minister, for the first time in modern history, the right to detain without trial, without showing the evidence and indeed, in some respects, almost the allegation against the individual concerned.\"\nHe questioned why there was \"such a rush\" to introduce the legislation when Mr Clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"We believe it should be the judge that takes decisions, not politicians.\" Mr Clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be \"rash and negligent\" to ignore their advice. Nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the UK and its interests, he argued.",
    "A TV station in the US has refused to show a controversial new series where adopted children try and pick their birth father - and win a cash prize.\nThe WRAZ-TV Fox affiliate in North Carolina was the only one of 182 stations to refuse Monday's show. Who's Your Daddy promises $100,000 (£52,000) to the contestant if she correctly identifies her father. It was met with protests by the National Council for Adoption, which said it \"exploits\" sensitive emotions. \"It exploits the sensitive emotions of adoption,\" said Thomas Atwood, president of the National Council for Adoption. \"It trivialises them. Adoption is a very personal, meaningful experience and it should not be commercialised like this.\" On the pre-taped programme, the contestant is presented with eight men who may or may not be her natural father.\nIf she picks the correct man from the line-up, the contestant wins the jackpot prize of US$100,000 (£52,590). However, if she picks the wrong man, then the impostor takes the money. Fox producers defended the show, saying it was a \"positive experience\". They have made six specials, though only one episode has so far been broadcast.\n\"The special was thoroughly vetted by our standards and practices department to ensure that it was appropriate for broadcast,\" said a Fox spokesman. \"However, any network affiliate that feels the programming may be inappropriate for their individual market has the right to pre-empt the schedule.\" WRAZ-TV instead chose to air an independently-produced film, I Have Roots and Branches... Personal Reflections on Adoption, a documentary about families with adopted children. \"We just don't think adoption is a game show,\" said Tommy Schenck, WRAZ-TV's general manager, though he said his decision had not been influenced by public protests.",
    "Chelsea's win at Fulham - confirming their position at the Premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season.\nThey have got strength in depth, great players, an outstanding manager in Jose Mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match. All they need to add now is the big prizes which, as we all know, is the most difficult part of all. One thing is certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed. They beat a very tough Everton at Stamford Bridge, won at Newcastle in the Carling Cup, and then won 4-1 at Fulham, which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. As I said, winning the major honours is the hardest task of all, but in Mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now. Mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all, the Champions League, and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players. It is a priceless commodity. No-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by Mourinho. He is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people, and maybe he can appear that way, but he has the silverware to back up the talk. Mourinho doesn't simply talk a good game - he's won some very big games such as the Champions League final with Porto. Some may criticise his talk, but the words are backed up with actions. I've also found him to be very realistic whenever I've heard him. He's spent a lot of money and it seems to be working, and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked. The buys are now integrating, and in Arjen Robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension.\nIn the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics, and yet he was winning games. You cannot win titles early on in the season, but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital. I also thought the criticism was very harsh, because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful. Now they are taking those chances, have the double threat of Robben and Damien Duff, and things are looking good. I just wonder if they lack a predator, particularly with Didier Drogba injured. He was starting to look the part before he was sidelined, but you have to feel if Chelsea had a Ruud van Nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title. Chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the Champions League. I felt they would never have a better chance than last season, but they have swept all before them in Europe so far this season. It will now be very interesting to see how Mourinho prioritises things, but his life will be made easier by the size of Chelsea's squad. I have said I believed Chelsea would win the league this season, even when Arsenal were flying at the start, and I have seen nothing to make me change me mind.\nIf anything, what I have seen has confirmed my early impressions. And Chelsea would have taken encouragement from Arsenal's rocky defensive display at Spurs, even though they ran out 5-4 winners. Mourinho had his say on that game, complaining: \"Five-four is a hockey score, not a football score. \"In a three-against-three training match, if the score reaches 5-4 I send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly. \"So to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful.\"\nOn a more serious note, it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of Sol Campbell to Arsenal. Much criticism has been aimed at Pascal Cygan, but I believe the problem lies with the absence of Campbell and its overall effect on Arsenal's defence. Confidence is a crucial factor in defending. When you start conceding goals, you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area. You think \"oh no\" - then find your worst fears confirmed. Arsenal need to reverse the process, with or without Campbell, and get some clean sheets on the board. But the return of Campbell is key. He solidifies the unit, has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck. He is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him. Campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit. Chelsea have no such problems at present, which is why I would still place my money on them to edge out Arsenal as champions this season.",
    "Prime Minister Tony Blair purchased two copies of the charity single Band Aid 20 in Edinburgh on Friday.\nStaff were surprised when the Prime Minister walked into HMV at 0900 GMT, accompanied by aides and local police. \"When Mr Blair came in unannounced, we were all pretty gobsmacked,\" said HMV manager Clive Smith. \"Our customer helper approached him... it was only then we realised he wanted to buy copies of the Band Aid single, rather than the latest Eminem album.\" Predicted chart-topper Do They Know it's Christmas? is expected to sell at least 300,000 copies by the time the new chart is announced on Sunday. However, the new version of the 1984 single is not going to be released in the US, despite being sold in many countries around the world. US record shops are stocking an import version of Do They Know It's Christmas, which is said to be selling very well in Los Angeles and New York. The original track was released in the US, and reached number 13 in the singles chart. British stars who appear on the current recording, such as Dido and Coldplay's Chris Martin, are well-known to music fans across the Atlantic, along with U2 frontman Bono.\nRecord company Universal is responsible for the global distribution of the single, which will be available across Europe, Asia, South America and Canada. But music fans in the US are still able to access the song and download it on Band Aid 20's official website. In 1985, a group of high-profile American stars known as USA For Africa came together to record their own fund-raising single, We Are The World. The song was written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, with Quincy Jones as producer. It topped the US charts for three weeks and went on win Grammy awards for best record and song.\nDionne Warwick, Diana Ross and Tina Turner were among the line-up of performers. It is predicted that the Band Aid 20 song will sell 300,000 copies in the UK by the time the new chart is announced on Sunday. The record is also tipped to become this year's Christmas number one, as the original version did in 1984. Proceeds from the sales are going towards relief for the Darfur region of Sudan and to combat HIV and Aids across Africa.",

The News of the World reports that Anelka told a French magazine: \"I either decide to win titles or to have an easy life. \"I think I will always choose football, if a great club makes me an offer.\" He added: \"To win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so. If we stagnate between eighth and 15th place it's impossible to progress. \"If I am going to score goals and not win, there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up.\" Anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris St Germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him.\n\"I am in talks to sign an extension to my contract,\" he said. \"I am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account. \"Playing for eighth place is good but I miss the Champions League. \"I won it with Real Madrid in 2000 and I need to be playing in it - and I should be playing in it. \"I'm not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football. \"But I don't blame anyone.

    "Sir Alex Ferguson has called on the Football Association to punish Arsenal's Thierry Henry for an incident involving Gabriel Heinze.\nFerguson believes Henry deliberately caught Heinze on the head with his knee during United's controversial win. The United boss said it was worse than Ruud van Nistelrooy's foul on Ashley Cole for which he got a three-game ban. \"We shall present it to the FA and see what they do. The tackle on Heinze was terrible,\" he said. Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. The clash occurred moments before half-time when a Freddie Ljungberg challenge left Heinze on the ground on the left touchline. Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinze's head.\nThe striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental. Ferguson was also upset by Arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side's behaviour. \"Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker,\" he said. \"There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge. \"I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. \"We have always been good at being gracious in defeat. What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, don't they?\"",
    "Hollywood film star Liam Neeson has held a dinner party in New York to promote Belfast's Lyric Theatre.\nThe Ballymena-born actor said that the theatre on Ridgeway Street was in a \"very dilapidated condition\". Lyric chairman David Johnston has said that rebuilding the theatre, at a cost of £8m is the only answer. Mr Neeson said that the idea was to get a bunch of \"healthy, wealthy Irish Americans\" in one room and ask them to help with fundraising.\nThe Oscar-nominated actor, whose films include Schindler's List, Michael Collins and Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, said: \"The Lyric is too important to the cultural and social life of Northern Ireland for this building to crumble and fall apart. \"It gave me a start professionally. Mary O'Malley, the founder of the theatre, gave me my future. \"In those days, in the mid-70s, when I was there, we were doing a play every four weeks. \"Belfast was not a pretty town to be living in. \"There was serious trouble, as you know, but this theatre was like a Belisha beacon of light and hope six nights a week, doing everything from Shakespeare to Yeats to O'Casey with a group of actors and actresses that affected me very deeply and still do.\" The Lyric began 50 years ago but the doors opened at its present site on the Stranmillis embankment overlooking the River Lagan in 1968.\nAs well as Liam Neeson, it also launched the careers of Adrian Dunbar and Stephen Rea and playwrights such as Martin Lynch and Gary Mitchell. Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland before the event at New York's SoHo House, Mr Neeson said that his spirit belonged to the Glens of Antrim. And he said that there was one figure from his childhood that he would love to portray on the big screen - Ian Paisley. He said that the DUP leader and preacher was a \"very dynamic, extraordinary figure\". Neeson used to listen to his sermons on a Friday night in Ballymena. He said: \"What an orator. He was from that old school of bible-thumping righteousness. But it was so dramatic. I found him very powerful. \"I'd love to get a chance to play him some time.\"",
    "Your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future?\nGifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact.

The first vouchers, worth £250 or £500 for low-income families, will be distributed from January. All children born after 1st September 2002 will be eligible. Parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in April 2005.\nParents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.\nThere are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. Some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the Ladybird account from the Saffron Walden Building Society, paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of £1 and the Alliance & Leicester FirstSaver which pays 5.25%, also starting at £1.\nInterest earned by children is subject to income tax. However, children, like adults, have a personal income tax allowance (£4,745 for the current tax year).\nIf the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. As long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance, then no tax will be payable. When the account is opened a form \"R85\", available from the bank or building society, should be completed. This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.\nThe tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. Only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children's names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. Therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.\nAnother favourite solution is Premium Bonds. With the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account, they make great presents. The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. Any prizes will be sent to the parent or child's guardian. The minimum for each purchase is £100 and Bonds are sold in multiples of £10.\nThere are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.\nOver the longer term, stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment, although in the shorter term they can be volatile. One of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. These are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. These funds may be actively managed, where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential, or passive, where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index, for example, the FTSE 100. Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. These are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). The difference is that the charges are quite low. The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent. For larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.",
    "The International Monetary Fund is to cut its 2005 growth forecast for the German economy from 1.8% to 0.8%, the Financial Times Deutschland reported.\nThe IMF will also reduce its growth estimate for the 12-member eurozone economy from 2.2% to 1.6%, the newspaper reported. The German economy has been faltering, with unemployment levels rising to a seventy-year high of 5.2 million. Its sluggish performance continues to hamper the entire eurozone.\nThe IMF's draft World Economic Outlook - due to be published in April - would point to a marked deterioration in Germany's economy, the FT report said.\nIn September, the IMF had said that German growth for the current year would be 1.8%. The IMF has also revised eurozone forecasts, the paper said, taking into account high oil prices, the strength of the euro and weak demand in many of the world's leading economies. Europe's economic difficulties have been highlighted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which argued in a report published on Tuesday that the continent could only achieve US living standards by freeing up its labour markets. \"The eurozone does not look like it has a self-sustaining recovery,\" James Carrick, an economist with ABN Amro, told the newspaper. \"It is too dependant on the rest of the world.\"",
    "Video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom.\nWith violent titles continuing to top the charts, gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. Recent research by the London Institute of Education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom. \"Games teach life skills such as decision making, problem solving,\" said Martin Owen, at Futurelab. Mr Owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error.\nFuturelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. Most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but Liverpool-based games firm Lateral Visions saw a gap in the market. \"Learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn't see anyone else doing what we wanted to do,\" said Dr Carl Gavin, managing director of Lateral Visions. The company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. The result is Racing Academy, a massively multiplayer car racing game, which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well.\nIt is being used by Futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. \"We are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game, we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational,\" said Mr Owen. Players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. The game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs, before and after racing. Teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data, work collaboratively and review their own performances. This fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to Futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved, thinks Mr Owen.\nThe game has been trialled in two secondary schools in Bristol and feedback from students has been positive. \"Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other,\" said Ben Williamson, a researcher at Futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. Dr Gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers' need for learning outcomes and the children's desire to rise to a challenge. \"Games in the classroom need to support the teacher. It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge,\" he said. Professor Angela MacFarlane, based at Bristol University, has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms.\nUse of games in schools has been patchy she found, with Sim City proving the most popular. Traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun, she found in her research. \"It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies,\" she wrote in a paper entitled Games and Learning. 'Lite' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. This would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. Already there are games on the market, such as Civilisation and Age of Empire, that have educational elements said Mr Owen. \"Even in Grand Theft Auto it is not just the violence that engages people,\" he said. It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though.",
    "Microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine.\nThe now formally launched MSN search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in November 2003. The revamped engine indexes more pages than before, can give direct answers to factual questions, and features tools to help people create detailed queries. Microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries.\nGoogle still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query, keep up with news or search for images. But in the last year Google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals, such as Yahoo and Microsoft, and new entrants such as Amazon and Blinkx, try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves. This renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page, recipe, book, gadget, news story, image or anything else. Microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to Google. To generate its corpus of data, Microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days - more often than rivals. The Microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer.\nFor its direct answer feature, Microsoft is calling on its Encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions, facts, calculations, conversions and solutions to equations. Tony Macklin, director of product at Ask Jeeves, pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since April 2003. \"The major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search, so in many ways Microsoft is following the market,\" he said. Tools sitting alongside the MSN search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites, countries, regions or languages. Microsoft is also using so-called \"graphic equalisers\" that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up-to-date or more popular. The company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system. The test, or beta, version of the MSN search engine unveiled in November had a few teething troubles. On its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed.",
    "Rock star Ozzy Osbourne has said his family will not make any more episodes of reality TV show The Osbournes.\n\"At the end of it I didn't like having cameras around the house all the time,\" the Black Sabbath singer told reporters at the MTV Europe Awards in Rome. His wife Sharon, who also appears in the popular MTV show based on the Osbournes' family life, agreed. \"Now everybody's doing reality shows. He's done it, he's been there, he's got to do something else,\" she said.\nOzzy Osbourne said he had had enough of the work involved in making the series. \"When you watch a 25-minute episode, I've been filming all day,\" he said. Sharon Osbourne is currently appearing as a judge and mentor in ITV1 talent show The X-Factor alongside Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh.\nEarlier this year she topped a poll of the most important people in rock, for her part in guiding the career of husband Ozzy and her family. She was the driving force behind The Osbournes, which ran for three series, earning the family a reported $85m (£46m). The renewed popularity for Ozzy has seen sales of his merchandise hit the $50m (£27.2m) mark, a record for a heavy metal artist. Sales of T-shirts, accessories and action figures have rocketed since The Osbournes hit screens. At its peak, The Osbournes had a regular audience of eight million, with America's TV Guide magazine describing the series as \"a cross between The Simpsons and This Is Spinal Tap\". Osbourne himself was at a loss to explain its popularity: \"I suppose Americans get a kick out of watching a crazy Brit family like us make complete fools of ourselves every week.\"",
    "Despite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report.\nUnemployment stood at 25%, compared with 10% before the uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago. Young people are particularly hard hit with 37% out of work, compared with 14% four years ago. But 104,000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures. However, during the first half of this year, the Palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs. Last year's growth rate of 6% can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence, the report said. According to the report, Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems. The closures arranged by Israel restrict the movement of Palestinian people and goods, slowing down trade.\n\"Closures are a key factor behind today's economic crisis in the West Bank,\" said Nigel Roberts, World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza. Nearly half of all Palestinians - some 47% - live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks. The report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation. It also called on the Palestinian Authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment-friendly climate. This week Colin Powell, US Secretary of State was visiting the West Bank to stress US support for a smooth Palestinian election in January.",
    "Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the Primera Liga club for the second time in his career.\nThe decision was taken at a board meeting following the side's surprise elimination from the Uefa Cup. \"We understand, and he understands, that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate,\" said club president Juan Bautista. Former assistant Antonio Lopez will take over as the new coach. Italian Ranieri took over the Valencia job in June 2004 having been replaced at Chelsea by Jose Mourinho.\nThings began well but the Spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to Racing Santander last weekend. That defeat was then followed by a Uefa Cup exit at the hands of Steaua Bucharest. Ranieri first took charge of Valencia in 1997, guiding them to the King's Cup and helping them to qualify for the Champions League. The 54-year-old then moved to Atletico Madrid in 1999, before joining Chelsea the following year.",
    "A slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler.\nThe German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003. Mercedes-Benz's woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.\nMercedes' profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003's 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. Sales of Mercedes' brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar.\nThe carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range. Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes' position as the world's most successful luxury brand. However, DaimlerChrysler's shares fell 1.5% on the news. \"While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz,\" Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters.\nIn contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%. The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.\nOverall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. Chrysler's strong performance helped the world's fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.\n\"The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment,\" said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman. DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso. DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso. Looking forward, DaimerChrysler's profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. However, it is expecting \"significant improvements\" in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.",
    "German airline Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003.\nIn a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; £274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003. Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. It was also hit by troubles at its US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend. The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 March.",
    "A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.\nContrack International, of Arlington, Virginia, heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. Its withdrawal from the $325m (£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon's Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack's management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\nUS firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"",
    "The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says.\nJavier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other European countries. Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge. But Home Secretary Charles Clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: \"[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it. \"It would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal.\" Mr Solana's comments come the day after Sir Ian Blair, the newly-appointed Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence.\nUnder the Anti-Terrorism Crimes and Security Act 2001, foreign terror suspects can be detained in British jails without trial or charge. Several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.\nSome of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. Human Rights group Liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard, these detainees could be brought to trial. But critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services. The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance. But Mr Clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after Law Lords ruled it illegal. He has opted for a system of \"control orders\" whereby suspects, both British and foreign, can be held under house arrest or surveillance. These orders will again involve a UK opt-out of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights. While accepting that people \"have to be prepared\" for a possible terrorist attack, Mr Solana said he had \"qualms\" about the home secretary's new plans. \"We have to fight terrorism with all our means, but not so far as to change our way of life,\" he said.",

In 1995 he directed an episode of the medical drama ER and has also appeared in Alias.\nMs Mendelsohn said the production team had been trying for a while to get Tarantino to direct an episode of CSI, and added that he was a fan of the forensic drama. She said he finally agreed a few weeks ago while CSI was doing some location shooting in Las Vegas and the show's stars persuaded him. \"He knows everything there is to know about CSI, and he is into the whole mythology of CSI,\" Mendelsohn said. \"Quentin came in a couple of weeks ago. We had a story meeting with the writers. \"He had a great idea, and it was so much fun to have him in the room... we are positively giddy.\" Filming is due to start in early April and the Tarantino-directed episode will be broadcast in the US on 19 May.",
    "Leicester withstood a stunning Wasps comeback to win a pulsating Heineken Cup encounter at the Causeway Stadium.\nThe Tigers stormed 22-6 ahead within 18 minutes through tries from Lewis Moody, Geordan Murphy and Martin Corry. European champions Wasps fought back through a Josh Lewsey try and Mark van Gisbergen's boot, and they were level at 31-31 with five minutes remaining. But it was the visitors who kept their cool as Andy Goode kicked the Tigers to victory with a penalty and a drop goal. The closing moments saw desperate defence from Leicester as Wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed. Wasps pounded the line and a penalty try looked likely before referee Nigel Williams controversially blew for full-time. Fly-half Goode was the Tigers hero, kicking 22 points in total, while Leicester's overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told. Even their lack of discipline in defence - which presented the admirable Van Ginsberg with 26 points - could not undo them as they held out for a famous win.\nLawrence Dallaglio's team have now got it all to do in the quest for a quarter-final place given that two of their last three games are away - against Leicester and Biarritz. However, Wasps rugby director Warren Gatland warned his side will will not relinquish their European title without a fight. \"If we lose next week, then we are struggling,\" said Gatland. \"But we don't want to give this trophy away. We worked so hard to win it last season, we will go down fighting. \"We have got to get our scrum right next week, it is the biggest cause for concern.\" Leicester coach John Wells saluted the outstanding work of Graham Rowntree and Julian White, who were magnificent up front. \"They were the backbone of our performance today,\" said Wells. \"And to score three tries against the European champions at home was also something I am pleased about.\"\nVan Gisbergen; Lewsey, Erinle, Abbott, Voyce; King, Dawson; Dowd, Greening, Green; Shaw, Birkett; Worsley, O'Connor, Dallaglio (capt).\nReplacements: Gotting, McKenzie, Lock, Hart, Biljon, Brooks, Hoadley.\nMurphy; Rabeni, Smith, Gibson, Healey; Goode, Ellis; Rowntree, Chuter, White, M Johnson (capt), L Deacon; Moody, Back, Corry.\nReplacements (from): Buckland/Cockerill, Morris, Kay, W Johnson/B Deacon, H Tuilagi, Bemand, A Tuiliagi, Lloyd, Vesty.",
    "Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.\nLG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. The firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in January 2004, which gave control to the creditors. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card's plastic for purchases.\nLG Card's creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.\n\"Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,\" said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm's major creditors. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. It says it wants \"fair and reasonable guidelines\" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said. Analysts believe a compromise is likely. \"LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,\" said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.\nLG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. LG card's creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. \"Eventually, LG Group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,\" said Mr Kim.",
    "David McLetchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role.\nThe Scottish Conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with Tods Murray did not influence the causes he supports. But on Friday he said: \"I have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect.\" Mr McLetchie had received advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. Labour said he had \"cleverly\" not asked about paid advocacy. A Tory spokesman \"totally refuted\" any wrongdoing.\nMr McLetchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport. The MSP had been a partner for Tods Murray which has a client opposing the development. Mr McLetchie did not have a complaint made against him, but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong.\nExplaining his reason for quitting the post, Mr McLetchie said: \"I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray. \"However, I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. \"To avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of Tods Murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled, I have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. \"I am proud to have been a part of Tods Murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future.\"\nLabour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was \"very clever\" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. \"He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,\" she said. Section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings \"where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner\". However, MSPs' Code of Conduct \"recognises a wider definition\" of parliamentary proceedings, including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions.\nBut a letter from Holyrood's Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. Commenting on Mr McLetchie's decision to stand down, a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: \"This should mean Mr McLetchie doesn't breach the paid advocacy rules in future. \"However it doesn't change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past.\"\nScottish National Party Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr McLetchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. Ms Sturgeon said: \"I think this whole episode has been very damaging for Mr McLetchie and I'm sure he will be reflecting on it.\" She added that she thought that the Tories were an irrelevant party so she would not \"lose any sleep over it\". Peter Misselbrook, executive partner of Tods Murray said Mr McLetchie had been considering retirement later in the year. He added: \"David has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so.\"",
    "Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.\nFreezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the US, where stocks are low. Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since November. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that it saw no reason to cut its output.\nAlthough below last year's peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004's average of $41.48.\nBrent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close. Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. \"The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it,\" said Chris Furness, senior market strategist at 4Cast. \"If the dollar continues to weaken, oil will be obviously higher.\"\nSeveral Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. \"I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,\" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters. \"I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,\" he added. Opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market. The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year. Heavy stockpiles could help force prices lower when demand eases.",
    "Crude oil prices surged back above the $47 a barrel mark on Thursday after an energy market watchdog raised its forecasts for global demand.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) warned demand for Opec's crude in the first quarter would outstrip supply. The IEA raised its estimate of 2005 oil demand growth by 80,000 barrels a day to 84 million barrels a day. US light crude rose $1.64 to $47.10, while Brent crude in London gained $1.32 to $44.45.\nThe Paris-based IEA watchdog, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from China and other Asian countries. The fresh rally in crude prices followed gains on Wednesday which were triggered by large falls in US crude supplies following a cold spell in North America in January. The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m. On top of that, ongoing problems for beleaguered Russian oil giant Yukos have also prompted the IEA to revise its output estimates from Russia - a major non-Opec supplier. \"I think that prices are now beginning to set a new range and it looks like the $40 to $50 level,\" said energy analyst Orin Middleton of Barclays Capital.",
    "The rewards of leaving front-bench politics are shown in the latest annual register of members' interests.\nThe register shows former Tory leader William Hague earning up to £820,000 on top of his MPs' salary, much of it from speaking fees. His former shadow chancellor Michael Portillo makes up to £560,000 a year - partly because of speeches and TV work. Ex-health secretary Alan Milburn earned up to £85,000 from speeches, articles and advice while not in the Cabinet.\nMr Milburn was away from the frontbench for just more than a year between stepping down as health secretary and becoming Labour's election supremo. His declared interests include £20,000 from newspaper articles and fees of up to £35,000 for four speeches. He also commanded a salary of between £25,000 and £35,000 for being on investment company Bridgepoint Capital's European advisory committee. His time out of office will, however, have lost him his £71,433 minister's salary. Mr Hague's work outside Parliament included two one-man shows, which with other speaking fees netted him up to £480,000. He also earned up to £195,000 for a weekly column in the News of the World, and between £5,000 and £10,000 for presenting BBC'2's Have I Got News for You. Mr Hague was also paid an undisclosed amount for the newspaper serialisation of his biography of William Pitt the Younger and up to £135,00 for work as an adviser to various companies.\nFormer Defence Secretary Michael Portillo makes some of his money as a non-executive director of BAE Systems. He is to stand down as an MP at the next election. And former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was paid between £45,001 and £50,000 for the paperback edition of his book about his resignation from government. His declared income of up to £205,000 also includes payments for being a consultant to the Tote and for his regular column in the Guardian newspaper. The register also shows former Home Office Minister Ann Widdecombe declaring a £100,000 advance for her third and fourth novels. She also received up to £30,000 for acting as the Guardian's agony aunt and between £5,001 and £10,000 for appearing on ITV's Celebrity Fit Club. David Blunkett has become a paid adviser to Indepen Consulting Limited now he is not home secretary - he helps them with seminars about the relationship between government and business. He earns between £5,001and £10,000 for the work.\nTony Blair's entry confirms that King Abdullah of Jordan paid for him to fly from a holiday in Egypt to official discussions - and for a sightseeing tour to Wadi Rum. Tory leader Michael Howard's only fresh entry is a Christmas hamper from the Sultan of Brunei. He also declares a trip to Mexico last year to address executives of News International, and helicopter and private jet travel paid for by supporters. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy registered donations to his office from supporters, a free ticket to last year's Bafta awards and rent from a single-bedroom flat in London. The register only contains new information for December 2004 - but Monday saw the publication of the annual review of the register, with the year's details. The payments are shown in bands of up £5,000, making it difficult to calculate the exact earnings.",
    "Flanker Colin Charvis is unlikely to play any part in Wales' final two games of the Six Nations.\nCharvis has missed all three of Wales' victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected. \"He will not figure in the Scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game,\" said Wales physio Mark Davies. Sonny Parker is continuing to struggle with a neck injury, but Hal Luscombe should be fit for the Murrayfield trip. Centre Parker has only a \"slim chance\" of being involved against the Scots on 13 March, so Luscombe's return to fitness after missing the France match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost.\nSaid Wales assistant coach Scott Johnson: \"We're positive about Hal and hope he'll be raring to go. \"He comes back into the mix again, adds to the depth and gives us other options. \" Replacement hooker Robin McBryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in Paris last Saturday. \"We're getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how Robin's looking,\" added Johnson. \"We're hopeful but it's too early to say at this stage.\" Steve Jones from the Dragons is likely to be drafted in if McBryde fails to recover.",
    "Microsoft has given game makers a glimpse of the new Xbox 2 console.\nSome details of the Xbox's performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual Game Developers Conference in the US. Xbox frontman J. Allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second. Also all titles for the new Xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games.\nMicrosoft is saving the official unveiling of the Xbox 2, codenamed Xenon, for the E3 show in May and the device could be on shop shelves by November. However, during his keynote speech at GDC Mr Allard, who heads development of game-making tools for the console, gave a glimpse into how some of its core software will work. He said gaming was entering a \"high-definition\" era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the HDTV people were starting to watch as well as the HD DVDs that will soon start to appear.\nIndustry watchers took this to mean that the Xbox 2 will push for HDTV quality graphics as standard as well as multi-channel audio to give gamers an authentic experience. Mr Allard said Microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the Xbox 2 and for players to get playing. To this end Microsoft was building in to Xbox hardware systems to support headset chat, buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games. The Xbox would also support well-known industry specifications, such as DirectX, to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console. For gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every Xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware. This interface will hold details of a player's statistics and skill level on a \"gamer card\" as well as give access to a store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons, such as new maps or vehicles, for games they possess. This ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future, said Mr Allard. Only with such consistency would the Xbox be able to support the 10-20 million subscribers that it was aiming for, said Mr Allard. During his speech Mr Allard took several swipes at the Playstation and said processors for consoles had to be made with developers, not just engineers, in mind. \"Our approach is Bruce Lee, not brute force,\" he said.",
    "Shares in online auction house eBay fell 9.8% in after-hours trade on Wednesday, after its quarterly profits failed to meet market expectations.\nDespite seeing net profits rise by 44% to $205.4m (£110m) during October to December, from $142m a year earlier, Wall Street had expected more. EBay stock fell to $92.9 in after-hours trade, from a $103.05 end on Nasdaq. EBay's net revenue for the quarter rose to $935.8m from $648.4m, boosted by growth at its PayPal payment service.\nExcluding special items, eBay's profit was 33 cents a share, but analysts had expected 34 cents.\n\"I think Wall Street has gotten a bit ahead of eBay this quarter and for the 2005 year.\" said Janco Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen. For 2004 as a whole, eBay earned $778.2m on sales of $3.27bn. EBay president and chief executive Meg Whitman called 2004 an \"outstanding success\" that generated \"tremendous momentum\" for 2005. \"I'm more confident than ever that the decisions and investments we're making today will ensure a bright future for the company and our community of users around the world,\" she said. EBay now forecasts 2005 revenue of $4.2bn to $4.35bn and earnings excluding items of $1.48 to $1.52 per share. Analysts had previously estimated that eBay would achieve 2005 revenues of $4.37bn and earnings of $1.62 per share, excluding items.",
    "Brewing giant Inbev has agreed to buy Alfa-Eco's stake in Sun Interbrew, Russia's second-largest brewer, for up to 259.7m euros ($353.3m; £183.75m).\nAlfa-Eco, the venture capital arm of Russian conglomerate Alfa Group, has a one-fifth stake in Sun Interbrew. The deal gives Inbev, the world's biggest beermaker, near-total control over the Russian brewer. Inbev bought out another partner in August 2004. Inbev brands include Bass, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden and Staropramen. It employs 77,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.\nThe Leuven-based brewery said it would own 97.3% of the voting shares and 98.8% of the non-voting shares of Sun Interbrew. The deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. Inbev was formed in August 2004 when Belgium's Interbrew bought Brazilian brewer Ambev. Sun Interbrew, which employs 8,000 staff, owns breweries in eight Russian cities - Klin, Ivanovo, Saransk, Kursk, Volzhsky, Omsk, Perm and Novocheboksarsk. There are also three breweries in Ukraine, in the cities of Chernigov, Nikolaev and Kharkov.",
    "The £10bn Crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get the go-ahead this month, according to The Mail on Sunday.\nIt says the UK Treasury has allocated £7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly. The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast cross-London rail link. The paper says it will go before the House of Commons on 23 February.\nA second reading could follow on 16 or 17 March. \"We've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this remains the case,\" the Department for Transport said on Sunday. Jeremy de Souza, a spokesman for Crossrail, said on Sunday he could not confirm whether the Treasury was planning to invest £7.5bn or when the bill would go before Parliament.\nHowever, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election.\nThe new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of London, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City. Heathrow to the City would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube. The line has the support of the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, business groups and the government, but there have been three years of arguments over how it should be funded. The Mail on Sunday's Financial Mail said the £7.5bn of Treasury money was earmarked for spending in £2.5bn instalments in 2010, 2011 and 2012.",

Get Me Out Of Here as no evictions were made on the television show on Saturday.\nContestants Paul Burrell, Joe Pasquale, Janet Street-Porter and Fran Cosgrave were told by hosts Ant and Dec. Natalie Appleton's decision to quit the show last Monday had given them all a stay of execution, the group were told. Model Sophie Anderton was the last person to be voted off the ITV1 show, set in the Australian jungle. The four remaining stars will do a joint Bushtucker Trial on Sunday.\nFormer All Saints singer Natalie Appleton,31, walked out of the show after learning she would face a fifth so-called Bushtucker Trial. The celebrities are chosen by the viewers to pass trials in order to win food for the rest of the camp.

    "Newcastle have joined the race to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes and scupper Liverpool's bid to snap up the player, according to reports.\nLiverpool were reported to have bid £3.5m for the 28-year-old Spanish international this week. But the Liverpool Echo newspaper has said Anfield boss Rafa Benitez will avoid a bidding war and instead turn his attentions to Nicolas Anelka. Real are believed to still want £7m before selling Morientes. Monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season. Reports suggest Liverpool will lift their offer to £5m - the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal.\nOn Tuesday, Morientes had said: \"I like Liverpool and I am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me. I have told Madrid that I want it to happen. \"Madrid know my situation and they know they must do something about me. They must sort out the situation by being sensible. \"I am in a position where I want to play, and I will have to look elsewhere to do that. If Madrid do not want me then it's in the best interests of everyone that they are realistic.\n\"I haven't spoken to Rafa Benitez but I have always appreciated his work and I would like to play for him. But Benitez could yet turn his attentions to the younger Anelka should Morientes be reluctant to pledge his future to Liverpool. Anelka previously played at Anfield under Gerard Houllier before sealing his permanent switch to Manchester City.",
    "The UK's trade gap narrowed in November, helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the European Union.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the difference between what the UK exported and imported was £3.1bn ($5.8bn), down from October's £3.6bn. Overall UK exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3.2% to £24.8bn, although total imports rose again to a new record of £27.9bn. The deficit for goods alone was £4.6bn, down from October's £5bn. During November the UK exported £16.9bn worth of goods, but imported £21.5bn. The cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at £36.3bn, £4.5bn higher than the same period in 2003.\nNovember saw an improvement in export levels to both the European Union and the rest of the world, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. EU exports rose 2%, fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. Non-EU exports shot up 7.5%, with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars, consumer durables and chemicals. The export boost offset a 1% rise in imports. Non-EU imports rose 3%, but the growth in goods entering the UK from the EU slowed to 0.5%.\nThe UK's deficit with the EU fell to £1.9bn from £2.1bn, while its non-EU shortfall dropped to £2.7bn from £2.9bn in October.\nThe country's surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at £1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. Paul Dales, UK economist for Capital Economics, said the figures represented an improvement on recent months. However, he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain. \"The figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor,\" he said. \"There have been some very encouraging signs that the UK export recovery is starting to take hold. But there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent.\"",
    "Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers, who is accused of overseeing an $11bn (£5.8bn) fraud, never made accounting decisions, a witness has told jurors.\nDavid Myers made the comments under questioning by defence lawyers who have been arguing that Mr Ebbers was not responsible for Worldcom's problems. The phone company collapsed in 2002 and prosecutors claim that losses were hidden to protect the firm's shares. Mr Myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors.\nOn Monday, defence lawyer Reid Weingarten tried to distance his client from the allegations. During cross examination, he asked Mr Myers if he ever knew Mr Ebbers \"make an accounting decision?\". \"Not that I am aware of,\" Mr Myers replied. \"Did you ever know Mr Ebbers to make an accounting entry into Worldcom books?\" Mr Weingarten pressed. \"No,\" replied the witness. Mr Myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former Worldcom chief financial officer Scott Sullivan. Defence lawyers have been trying to paint Mr Sullivan, who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial, as the mastermind behind Worldcom's accounting house of cards.\nMr Ebbers' team, meanwhile, are looking to portray him as an affable boss, who by his own admission is more PE graduate than economist. Whatever his abilities, Mr Ebbers transformed Worldcom from a relative unknown into a $160bn telecoms giant and investor darling of the late 1990s. Worldcom's problems mounted, however, as competition increased and the telecoms boom petered out. When the firm finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Mr Ebbers' trial is expected to last two months and if found guilty the former CEO faces a substantial jail sentence. He has firmly declared his innocence.",
    "David Miliband's rapid rise through the ranks of government continues with his promotion to Cabinet Office minister.\nElected in a safe Labour seat in 2001 his previous job was school standards minister - a role he won in May 2002. Prior to the last election he was a key figure in New Labour as the head of the Downing Street policy unit where he was a key member of the manifesto writing team. Seen as one of the more intellectual figures in the government, he was also working for Tony Blair in his policy unit when he was leader of the opposition.\nA brief glance at Mr Miliband's family background reveals an impressive socialist pedigree in the form of his father Ralph, who died in 1994. He was an eminent and influential leftwing academic. And while David Miliband is seen as a key Blair lieutenant his brother Ed is a special advisor to Chancellor Gordon Brown. Prior to working for Mr Blair, David Miliband spent time at the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. He then became secretary of the Commission on Social Justice. The 39-year-old was educated at Haverstock Comprehensive before going on to Oxford to study politics, philosophy and economics. He also took an MSc in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
    "The US dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on Friday as concern grows about the size of the US budget deficit.\nAnalysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. The Bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. However, trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. This has amplified reactions to news, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in January.\nThe dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on Friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on Thursday. One dollar bought 102.55 yen.\nDisappointing business figures from Chicago triggered the US currency's weakness on Thursday. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2, a bigger fall than expected. \"There are no dollar buyers now, especially after the Chicago data yesterday,\" said ABN Amro's Paul Mackel. At the same time, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was \"absolutely worrying\" for Italian exports. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. Investors will now look towards February's meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised nations in London for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar's decline.",

But it is believed that Glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move. He will still need the approval of major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who own 28.9% of the club to succeed. But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake, while fans remain opposed to his involvement.",

We are top of the league by nine points and in the Carling Cup final. \"The only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the FA Cup. \"In the Champions League all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still Chelsea.\"\nMourinho said it was important to keep his team's results in perspective. \"Don't try to put pressure on me because I am never under pressure,\" he warned. \"We have lost one important game this week - at Newcastle - and we're out of the FA Cup but I don't think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat.

    "India has signed a $40bn (£21bn) deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas from Iran.\nFirms led by the Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will also assist in the development of Iranian oil fields. Ministers, eager to gain access to energy supplies to meet the demands of a booming economy, secured a similar deal to one between Iran and China. The announcement comes as ONGC said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled Russian oil firm Yukos. The agreements with Iran were sealed after talks in New Delhi between Middle East producers and Asia's biggest energy consumers - China, India, Japan and South Korea.\nIran - Opec's second-biggest oil producer and one of the world's top gas producers - has been pursuing a series of deals, rewarding LNG buyers with participation in development of its oil fields. Under the agreement, it will supply India with 7.5 million tonnes of LPG annually over a 25 year period from 2009. ONGC and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) reached a preliminary deal for Indian firms to take part in the development of the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, both countries said in a statement. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. Consumption has jumped to 2.4 million barrels per day, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.",
    "An ex-chief financial officer at Boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $250,000 (£131,961) for illegally hiring a top Air Force aide.\nMichael Sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting Darleen Druyun while she still handled military contracts. Ms Druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. Boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a Pentagon inquiry into the case. The contract, to provide refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, was cancelled last year.\nThe Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by Ms Druyun's role in the procurement process. Boeing sacked Mr Sears and Ms Druyun in November 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. Ms Druyun had talks with Mr Sears in October 2002 about working for Boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the Pentagon. She subsequently joined the company in January 2003. Ms Druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to Boeing and other favoured companies.\nIn documents filed in a Virginia court ahead of Mr Sears' sentencing, prosecutors blamed Boeing's senior management for failing to ask key questions about the \"legal and ethical issues\" surrounding Ms Druyun's appointment. Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with Boeing. However, analysts believe Boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. The Pentagon has investigated 400 contracts, dating back to 1993, since the allegations against Ms Druyun came to light.\nBoeing's corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. Boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. The Pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to Boeing and prohibited the Seattle-based company from future rocket work.",
    "Kraft plans to cut back on advertising of products like Oreo cookies and sugary Kool-Aid drinks as part of an effort to promote healthy eating.\nThe largest US food maker will also add a label to its more nutritional and low-fat brands to promote the benefits. Kraft rival PepsiCo began a similar labelling initiative last year. The moves come as the firms face criticism from consumer groups concerned at rising levels of obesity in US children. Major food manufacturers have recently been reformulating the content of some calorie-heavy products.\nKraft's new advertising policy, which covers advertising on TV, radio and in print publications, is aimed at children between the ages of six and 11. It means commercials for some of its most famous snacks and cereals shown during early morning cartoon shows on TV will now be replaced by food and drink qualifying for Kraft's new \"Sensible Solution\" label. But the firm said it would continue to advertise all its products in media seen by parents and \"all family\" audiences. \"We're working on ways to encourage both adults and children to eat wisely by selecting more nutritionally balanced diets,\" said Lance Friedmann, Kraft senior vice president.",
    "The Tories say ministers must respond in Parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the Iraq war was drawn up at Number 10.\nDowning Street has denied the claims, made in a new book about the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's advice. Lord Goldsmith also denied them, saying he was not \"leaned on\" in any way. But the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.\nThe government has consistently refused to publish Lord Goldsmith's advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.\nBut a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. It said it was \"plain\" Iraq continued to be in material breach of UN resolution 1441. In his new book, Lawless World, Philippe Sands, a QC and international law professor, suggests the parliamentary answer was written in Downing Street. According to Mr Sands, Lord Goldsmith had warned Tony Blair in a document on 7 March 2003 that the use of force against Iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.\nMr Sands told Newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case, in case legal action was taken against the UK over the war. On 10 March, military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. The book, being serialised in the Guardian newspaper, says on 13 March Lord Goldsmith met then Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan. \"After that Downing Street proceeded to set out his [Lord Goldsmith's] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 March,\" said Mr Sands.\nTory leader Michael Howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General, warning: \"This issue will not go away.\" \"These revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates - even on an issue as important as peace and war. \"The government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust.\" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell repeated his party's calls for Lord Goldsmith's first piece of legal advice to be made public. \"The public interest, which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice, can only be served now by the fullest disclosure.\"\nIn a statement to Newsnight, Lord Goldsmith said: \"In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions. \"It was certainly not a view that I expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way, nor as I have already made clear, was it written by or at Number 10.\" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected the claims, saying: \"The attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his.\" But ex-foreign secretary Robin Cook says all the advice should now be published. He said the claims suggested Parliament had only received a pr&#233;cis of Lord Goldsmith's second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in No 10. This would be wrong even if Lord Goldsmith had signed the statement, Mr Cook said, because the attorney general's advice should be an \"independent legal opinion\", not subject to \"political negotiation of this kind\".",
    "Deutsche Boerse bosses have held \"constructive, professional and friendly\" talks with the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its chief has said.\nWerner Seifert met LSE chief executive Clara Furse amid rumours the German group may raise its bid to £1.5bn ($2.9bn) from its initial £1.3bn offer. However, rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. The Paris-based exchange, owner of Liffe in London, is reported to be ready to raise £1.4bn to fund a bid.\nThe news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE since its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London exchange for undervaluing the business. However, the LSE did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \"significantly-improved proposal\" would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. However, neither side has made a formal offer for the LSE, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away.\nDeutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. Among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by Mr Seifert with Ms Furse were plans to move the management of its cash and Eurex derivatives market to London, as well as two members of its executive board. But, Hans Reckers, a board member of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt, something Deutsche Boerse could move to the UK. \"It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt. This has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants,\" he said. Local government officials in Frankfurt's state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move. \"It is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain Frankfurt's standing as the number one financial centre in continental Europe,\" Alois Rhiel, its minister for economic affairs added.",
    "Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm Guidant for $25.4bn (£13bn).\nGuidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. Analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting Johnson & Johnson's reliance on a slowing drug business. They also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. A number of Johnson & Johnson's products are facing patent expirations, while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. Meanwhile, demand for defibrillators, which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected, is expected to increase, analysts said. The move by Johnson & Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each Guidant share, 6% more than Wednesday's closing price. Analysts say that US antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. Stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.",
    "Interactive posters are helping Londoners get around the city during the festive season.\nWhen interrogated with a mobile phone, the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home. Sited at busy underground stations, the posters are fitted with an infra-red port that can beam information directly to a handset. The posters are part of Transport for London's Safe Travel at Night campaign.\nThe campaign is intended to help Londoners, especially women, avoid trouble on the way home. In particular it aims to cut the number of sexual assaults by drivers of unlicensed minicabs. Nigel Marson, head of group marketing at Transport for London (TfL), said the posters were useful because they work outside the mobile phone networks. \"They can work in previously inaccessible areas such as underground stations which is obviously a huge advantage in a campaign of this sort,\" he said.\nThe posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an IR port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster. \"We started with infra-red because there are a huge number IR phones out there,\" said Rachel Harker, spokeswoman for Hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters. \"It's a well established technology.\" Hypertag is also now making a poster that uses short-range Bluetooth radio technology to swap data. Although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number, Ms Harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images, ring tones and video clips. She said that there are no figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign run for a cosmetics firm racked up 12,500 interactions. \"Before we ran a campaign there was a big question mark of: 'If we build it will they come?'\" she said. \"Now we know that, yes, they will.\" The TfL campaign using the posters will run until Boxing Day.",
    "A study of the United States at war in the past 50 years has picked up one of the main awards at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival in Utah, in the US.\nWhy We Fight scooped the grand jury prize for documentaries at the world's leading independent film festival. British director Sean McAllister's The Liberace of Baghdad - about a pianist in war-torn Iraq - won a special prize in the world documentary category. Both Why We Fight and The Liberace of Baghdad were made for the BBC. Why We Fight is due to be screened on BBC Four in March.\nThe Sundance festival was founded by actor Robert Redford in 1981. This year's festival - which ended on Sunday after a 11-day run - has been dominated by the themes of war and politics. In the new world cinema drama category, the Angolan film The Hero triumphed to win the grand jury prize. The film - an Angolan/French/Portuguese production - tells the story of a veteran of the country's civil war who returns home to face a new battle of survival. Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focused on countries and people under siege.\nFinnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya and Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire tells the story of a UN mission to Rwanda during the 1994 genocide. But it was Dutch documentary Shape of the Moon - a study of an extended family in Indonesia - which took the top prize. Meanwhile, French-Israeli production Wall, which looks at Israel's controversial security wall separating it from the Palestinian territories, picked up a world cinema special jury prize for documentaries. In the main drama category, Forty Shades of Blue was named winner of the grand jury prize. The film tells the tale of a forbidden tug-of-love between a father, his Russian immigrant girlfriend and his son.\nDuring its 24-year history, the Sundance Film Festival has showcased successes such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project and The Full Monty. Last year's festival provided a platform for hits such as Open Water, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and Super-Size Me. The festival is held in the mountain resort of Park City, east of Salt Lake City, which sees its population rise from 7,500 to 45,000 during the festival.",
    "Now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for TV is being prepared for our sets.\nIn most corners of TV and technology industries, high-definition (HDTV) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour. HD essentially makes TV picture quality at least four times better than now. But there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about HD on the High Street. Thousands of flat panel screens - LCDs (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV sets - have already been sold as \"HD\", but are in fact not able to display HD.\n\"The UK is the largest display market in Europe,\" according to John Binks, director of GfK, which monitors global consumer markets.\nBut, he added: \"Of all the flat panel screens sold, just 1.3% in the UK are capable of getting high-definition.\" There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra. They may be fantastic quality TVs, but many do not have adaptors in them - called DVI or HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. Part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the High Street, say industry experts, who gathered at Bafta in London for the 2nd European HDTV Summit last week. \"We have to be careful about consumer confusion. There is a massive education process to go through,\" said Mr Binks. The industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it. Eventually, that will be everyone. The BBC is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010.\nPreparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas, and programmes are being filmed with HD cameras. BSkyB plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes, to receive HDTV broadcasts, in time for Christmas. Like its Sky+ boxes, they will also be personal video recorders (PVRs). The company will start broadcasts of HDTV programmes, offering them as \"premium channel packages\", concentrating, to start with, on sports, big events, and films, in early 2006. But the set-top box which receives HDTV broadcasts has to plug into a display - TV set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that HD demands, if HDTV is to be \"real\". By 2010, 20% of homes in the UK will have some sort of TV set or display that can show HD in its full glory.\nBut it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to \"being digital\". As a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a HD forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other. Part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection. But it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for.\nFrom next month, all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a \"HD-Ready\" sticker. This also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. \"The logo is absolutely the way forward,\" said David Mercer, analysts with Strategy Analytics. \"But it is still not appearing on many retail products.\" The industry is upbeat that the sticker will help, but it is only a start. \"We can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers,\" said Mr Oudendijk. \"There may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months.\" The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is testing different flavours of HD formats to prepare for even better HDTV further down the line. It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, as well as which devices will support the formats. \"We believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile,\" said Phil Laven, technical director for the EBU. The TV display manufacturers want us to watch HD on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the \"true impact\" of HD, they say, although smaller displays suffice. What may convince people to spend money on HD-ready devices is the falling prices, which continue to tumble across Europe. The prices are dropping an average of 20% every year, according to analysts. LCD prices dropped by 43% in Europe as a whole last year, according to Mr Oudendijk.",
    "Sir Joshua Reynolds' Portrait of Omai will get a public airing following fears it would stay hidden because of an export wrangle.\nThe Tate Gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the UK. The 18th Century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition. The exhibition of Reynolds' work will be shown at Tate Britain from May. Joshua Reynolds: The Creation of Celebrity will feature prints, caricatures, and sculpture by the 18th Century artist, who painted some of the most famous personalities of his day. Portrait of Omai fetched the second highest amount for a British painting when it was sold at auction for £10.3m in 2001. It was bought by a London dealer who sold it on to a collector. The unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country, but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance.\nIn March 2004, the Tate managed to raise £12.5m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since. The portrait is of a young man who was dubbed \"the noble savage\" when he arrived in London from Polynesia. He became a darling of London society and was invited to all the best parties by people who were fascinated by such an exotic character. Sir Joshua painted him after his arrival in 1774, and it became the artist's most famous work after it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1776.",
    "Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.\nJohn Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be \"made available to law-abiding members of the community\" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The document reportedly said: \"We're looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. \"The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do.\" Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate. He told BBC News: \"He appears to have said these things. We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. \"By all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. \"It is simply a distraction from the task in hand, the EU constitution, not individual idiocies.\" Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: \"I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway.\"\nPeter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night. \"He will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.\" He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party. He added: \"I can't comment too much at the moment, I have one version from him but I haven't seen the papers yet.\"",
    "Celtic brushed aside Clyde to secure their place in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half.\nThe home side's Craig Bryson had a goal chopped off before Stan Varga headed Celtic into the lead. Alan Thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Shaun Maloney had been fouled. Stilian Petrov slid in a third, Varga tapped in his second and Craig Bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. Bryn Halliwell was the busier keeper early on, saving from Bellamy, Chris Sutton and Juninho. Clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from Bryson, but the referee had already blown for a foul by Petrov. From the resulting free kick, Darren Sheridan curled the ball round the Celtic wall only for the post to deny him. Back at the other end, Halliwell did well to come off his line and block Bellamy's effort to lift the ball over him. The keeper misjudged a corner that Stephane Henchoz headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. The ball was delivered from the left and Halliwell was left floundering as Varga glanced the ball into the net.\nMaloney replaced the injured Sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. The young striker fired a free kick straight into the Clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by Bryson and Thompson converted the penalty. Sheridan and Bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. Juninho brought out another good save from Halliwell and then Petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. But Petrov and Juninho combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past Halliwell from 12 yards. Varga got his second goal of the game as Celtic drove home their advantage - Thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and Bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving Aiden McGeady, Jackie McNamara and Maloney culminated in the Welshman hammering the ball into the net. Halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a McGeady shot wide as the game petered out.\nHalliwell, Mensing, Bollan, Balmer, Potter, Sheridan (Burns 61), Arbuckle (Gilhaney 61), Gibson, Bryson (Jones 78), Malone, Harty.\nMorrison, Wilson.\nMensing, Sheridan.\nDouglas, Henchoz, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Juninho Paulista, Thompson, Lennon (Lambert 70), Sutton (Maloney 45), Petrov (McGeady 70), Bellamy.\nMarshall, Laursen.\nThompson, Bellamy.\n: Varga 40, Thompson 48 pen, Petrov 60, Varga 68, Bellamy 72.\n8,200\nC Thomson",
    "Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby beat Martin Scorsese's The Aviator to the top awards at the Oscars on Sunday.\nThe boxing drama was named best picture and Eastwood pipped Scorsese to best director, while its stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won acting awards. The Aviator took five prizes including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett. The biopic of Howard Hughes led the nominations with 11. Jamie Foxx picked up best actor for playing soul star Ray Charles in Ray. Many expected this to be Scorsese's year - but he was unsuccessful in the best director category for the fifth time in his career.\nHe has never won despite being nominated for such films as Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Instead, Eastwood took his second Oscar for best director after winning for Unforgiven in 1993. \"It was a wonderful adventure,\" Eastwood said. \"To make a picture in 37 days, it takes a well oiled machine. I am lucky to be here and lucky to be still working. I've got a lot of stuff to do yet.\" Hilary Swank picked up her second best actress Oscar for playing a female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, beating stars including Annette Bening, Kate Winslet and Imelda Staunton. \"I don't know what I did in this life to deserve this,\" she told the audience. \"I'm just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream.\" Morgan Freeman beat actors including Clive Owen, Jamie Foxx and Alan Alda to the prize for best supporting actor. He thanked Eastwood and described the film as \"a labour of love\". This was the fourth nomination of his career but his first win. Backstage, he said: \"A lot of people say you're due - maybe you are, maybe you aren't - it's an accolade.\" Million Dollar Baby's success was the night's biggest surprise after The Aviator seemed to have the advantage until the end of the ceremony.\nCate Blanchett, who won for playing late screen legend Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, said her award was \"an indescribable surprise and honour\". Of Hepburn, she said: \"The longevity of her career is inspiring to everyone.\" Blanchett also paid tribute to the film's director Martin Scorsese, telling him: \"I hope my son will marry your daughter.\" The Aviator's other awards came for cinematography, film editing, art direction and costume design. And Jamie Foxx, who had two nominations this year, paid tribute to the \"beautiful legacy\" of soul legend Ray Charles, who died last year, and thanked director Taylor Hackford. \"You took a chance, man,\" he said. \"That love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. \"Everybody's drowning in this love. Thank you for taking a chance and thank you for waiting 15 years to get me to do it.\"\nHe broke down in tears when speaking about being whipped by his grandmother, whom he described as his first acting teacher, when he was young. In other awards, cartoon hit The Incredibles won best animated feature and best sound editing. Bittersweet comedy Sideways won best adapted screenplay while the original screenplay prize went to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Born into Brothels, about the children of prostitutes in Calcutta, was named best documentary, The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film and Finding Neverland got the accolade for best musical score. Spider-Man 2 triumphed in the visual effects category, Ray won best sound mixing and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events picked up best make-up. Former British TV presenter Andrea Arnold, who hosted children's shows Motormouth and Number 73 in the 1980s, won best short film for Wasp. Comedian Chris Rock, who hosted the ceremony for the first time, received a standing ovation before getting the show under way.",
    "Sri Lanka's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.\nPresident Kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from Sri Lanka's economic growth this year. It estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5% of the economy.\nSeparately, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in Sri Lanka and Indonesia alone. It called for action to create jobs. President Kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of Hambantota. She was joined by government and opposition politicians, together with Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian clergy.\nPrime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6,000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. Mrs Kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be \"the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation\". \"We are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. Instead we have been squabbling, fighting,\" she added. Norway's peace negotiator Erik Solheim is due to arrive on Wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the Tamil Tigers, who want a separate state in the north east of the country. Reconstruction efforts in eastern Sri Lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.\nThe IMF said that the Sri Lankan authorities' initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn, but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this. \"The broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage,\" the IMF said. Growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs. \"The fishing industry has been devastated, agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer, especially in the short term,\" the report said. The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries. Earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. Economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast. Inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. Although major exports have not suffered, the IMF expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves may become strained as \"Sri Lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level\" which totalled more than two months worth of imports. Last week, the IMF approved Sri Lanka's request for a freeze on loan repayments.",
    "Carlos Moya became the first man to successfully defend the Chennai Open title by beating four-times finalist Paradorn Srichaphan 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7/5).\nThe Spaniard then donated his £28,000 prize money to relief efforts for the victims of the Asian tsunami. The final was close throughout, with Thai second seed Srichaphan - the 2003 winner - closing out the first set. But Moya took the second set, before bouncing back from 5-2 down in the decider to force and win a tie-break. Moya confirmed afterwards: \"I'm donating my prize money from this tournament for the tsunami victims, hoping it makes some difference to their lives. His contribution follows pledges by four other players to donate their prize money from the tournament, which went ahead after the 26 December disaster which has so far claimed at least 150,000 lives. Scrichapan said he would donate an unspecified amount for relief work in Thailand, where more than 5,000 people were killed. The ATP has announced that it would contribute the US$25,000 tournament fee to Unicef's emergency relief fund in Tamil Nadu. The ATP Tour's sponsor, Mercedes, said it would also contribute, increasing the ATP donation to US$40,000.",
    "A mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful.\nThe specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video. Currently, rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. The technology, OMAP-Vox, is being tested by firms in Europe and Asia and could appear by the end of the year. Texas, which makes computer chips for more than half the world's mobile phones, said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable. \"We're going to drive them down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share,\" said Doug Rasor, a marketing vice president at Texas. The chip also uses much less power than conventional chips, said Texas, which means less strain on mobile battery life.\nMore than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK, but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. Texas is keen to cash in on the third generation (3G) of mobile technology, which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. But it faces stiff competition from the likes of Intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles.\nCompetition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK's operators have now launched third generation networks. A recent survey by Sony Ericsson predicted that the number of 3G handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold. Many consumers are still to be convinced though. A further recent survey said that only 4% of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3G phones. Many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard.\nBut there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. Earlier in January, NTT DoCoMo and Vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks, known as \"super 3G\", intended to be 10 times faster than 3G services. The first stage of development is to be completed by 2007, but no date has been set for a commercial launch The newly-designed OMAP-Vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference, 3GSM, which takes place in Cannes, France this week.",
    "Net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites\nInternet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail. Lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out. The net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool, spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data.\n\"We've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do,\" said Malte Pollmann, spokesman for Lycos Europe. \"In the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users,\" he said, \"but now we are going to go one step further.\"\n\"We've found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers.\" By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver, Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity. Mr Pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with. He said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web. \"Every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day,\" he said, \"about one MP3 file.\" But, he said, if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. Lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back, said Mr Pollmann. \"That would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing,\" he said.\nThe sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer.\nTypically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e-mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day. The list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as Spamcop. To limit the chance of mistakes being made, Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods. As these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said Mr Pollmann. Sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. Early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85%. Users do not have to be registered users of Lycos to download and use the screensaver. While working, the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data. The screensaver is due to be launched across Europe on 1 December and before now has only been trialled in Sweden. Despite the soft launch, Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days. \"There's a huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more,\" he said \"Before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive.\"",
    "The International Rugby Board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.\nIt may have to go the whole way and have NFL-style video cameras all over the field, or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. What the IRB does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. Sunday's explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road was a good example as Ireland took another step towards their first Grand Slam since 1948. The game was as exciting as it comes, with a much-improved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. One can understand that frustration. There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory, but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sport's \"blazers\". Referee Jonathan Kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. I doubt whether Kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. After all, he has no public recourse to criticism.\nIt was the same for Simon McDowell, the touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France. As far as England were concerned, there were queries over Mark Cueto's first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a Charlie Hodgson kick.\nEngland coach Andy Robinson referred to a similar case at Ravenhill in January when Ulster were playing Gloucester in the Heineken Cup. On that occasion, David Humphreys kicked to Tommy Bowe, who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. But you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. Perhaps Robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey was driven over the Irish line near the end.\nLewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. However, one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. But in rugby, everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. The referee also missed England's Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan O'Gara off the ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to the line. Those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes.\nBut there were many more, and one should not take away from those. Brian O'Driscoll's winning try was as well-conceived as they come, while Charlie Hodgson's brilliant kicking display was another highlight. And Ronan O'Gara's tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. But the defining moments came with Ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on. The first was Denis Hickie's brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. He gobbled up Cueto from another Hodgson cross-field kick, then regained his feet to stop Lewsey from scoring a certain try. Ireland's second-row colossus Paul O'Connell was equally superb. England had turned Ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. England prop Matt Stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. Unfortunately he ran into O'Connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. That spoke volumes about Ireland's back-foot display, with defensive coach Mike Ford taking a bow at the end. To win a game like that showed that Ireland have moved forward. It may be tries that win games, but it is defence that wins championships.",
    "General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.\nThe car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.\nGM's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. But the group's new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM's cuts.\nNeither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment's leaders do not agree.\nGM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.\nBringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. \"We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,\" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was \"stupid\", he said.\nIn a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change \"customers' perceptions\" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.",
    "Internet TV has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now.\nBut any early attempts to do it - the UK's Home Choice started in 1992 - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network. Now that broadband networks are bedding down, and it is becoming essential for millions, the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line. In the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls, they are keen to be the top IPTV dogs. Software giant Microsoft thinks IPTV - Internet Protocol TV - is the future of television, and it sits neatly with its vision of the \"connected entertainment experience\". \"Telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time,\" Ed Graczyk, director of marketing for Microsoft IPTV, told the BBC News website. \"The challenge has been the broadband network, and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution. \"Compression technology was not efficient enough, the net was not good enough. A lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality.\"\nLast year, he said, was all about deal making and partnering up; shaping the \"IPTV ecosystem\". This year, those deals will start to play out and more services will come online. \"2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in South America, and other parts of Asia, it will expand,\" he added. What telcos really want to do is to send the \"triple-play\" of video, voice, and data down one single line, be it cable or DSL (Digital Subscriber Line). Some are talking about \"quadruple play\", too, with mobile services added into the mix. It is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators. According to technology analysts, TDG Research, there will be 20 million subscribers to IPTV services in under six years.\nKey to the appeal of sending TV programmes down the same line as the web data, whenever a viewer wants it, is that it uses the same technology as the internet. It means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the \"broadcaster\". This allows for more DVD-like interactivity, limitless storage and broadcast space, bespoke channel \"playlists\", and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer's fingertips. It potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller, niche or localised audiences, sending films to Bollywood fans for instance, as well as individual devices.\nOperators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer, bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver. Perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking. Currently, there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite, cable or Freeview. With IPTV, the speed is 15 milliseconds. \"That gets rounds of applause,\" according to Mr Graczyk. Microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about IPTV some time ago. \"We believe this will be the way all TV is delivered in the future - but that is several years away,\" said Mr Graczyk. \"As with music, TV has moved to digital formats. \"The things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the TV, to the mobile, to the gaming console and so on.\" The company intends its Microsoft's IPTV Edition software, an end-to-end management and delivery platform, to let telcos to do exactly that, seamlessly. It has netted seven major telcos as customers, representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers. Its deal with US telco SBC was the largest TV software deal to date, said Mr Graczyk.\nIPTV is about more than telcos, though. There are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net's power. Jeremy Allaire, chief of Brightcove, told the BBC News website that it would be a flavour of IPTV that was about harnessing the web as a \"channel\".\n\"It is not just niches, but about exploiting content not usually viewed,\" he said. \"We are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content, and who often see unencumbered distribution. \"For them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive,\" he said. This type of IPTV service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives, for instance. What is a clear sign that IPTV has a future is that Microsoft is not the only player in the field. There are a lot of other \"middleware\" players providing similar management services as Microsoft, like Myrio and C-Cor. But it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful.",
    "Larne's teenage star Robbie Weir is poised to join Sunderland after turning down a move to Stoke City.\nThe 17-year-old Irish League midfielder was also being chased by Rangers and Fulham, but Mick McCarthy's side appear to have won the race. But Larne boss Jimmy McGeough has yet to confirm that Weir is on his way from Inver Park. \"I heard on Sunday that he has joined Sunderland, but not from the lad himself,\" he said. ''Robbie has an agreement with Larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs.\n''Personally, I would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the full-time game. ''He has been on trial with a number of clubs. But it would be great to see him making it at Sunderland.''",
    "Conservative leader Michael Howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall.\nMr Howard said his time at Jack's Snooker Hall in Llanelli in the 1950s had not done him \"any lasting damage\". But he told the Times Educational Supplement that truancy was \"very bad\" and said \"firm action\" was needed. Mr Howard also called for a return to O-levels and more classroom discipline.\nMr Howard eventually left Llanelli Grammar School - and the snooker hall - to go to Cambridge University. He said: \"I don't think it's done me any lasting damage. Nor has it made me a snooker world champion. \"There might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon.\n\"I'm just being honest. I think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it.\" Another player who has failed to win snooker's world championship - Jimmy \"the Whirlwind \" White - has previously admitted missing lessons, instead spending his days in smoky halls. \"Tony Meo [another player] and me used to spend all of our spare time there,\" Mr White said, \"We loved the game and the atmosphere. \"School went out of the window. I went for a while and then started taking time off.\" Mr Howard's fellow Welshman Ray Reardon - known by his fellow professionals as \"Dracula\" - won the snooker world championship six times, having left school at 14 to work as a miner. And Terry Griffiths, like Mr Howard from Llanelli, won the tournament in 1979. It is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at Jack's.",
    "Maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.\nIt would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.",
    "Labour MPs have angrily criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men.\nA meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise Labour's election hopes. The PM insisted nothing would derail Labour's campaign, despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside. Mr Brown will again be in the public eye at the party's new poster launch. In what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity, he is due to line up alongside Alan Milburn - the man controversially appointed as the party's election supremo - and deputy leader John Prescott for the event in London on Tuesday. Relations between Mr Brown and Mr Milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since Mr Blair brought the latter back into the Cabinet to run Labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by Mr Brown in both 1997 and 2001.\nMr Blair told the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\"\nThe prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the PLP and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. New speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in Brown's Britain, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, which suggested Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown. Labour's Paul Flynn said Mr Blair and Mr Brown had a \"scorching\" from MPs adding: \"It was a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting like no other.\"\nBackbencher Stephen Pound said some MPs had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if Mr Blair and Mr Brown did not \"stop this nonsense, this poisonous briefing\". Lord Campbell-Savours, a former MP, challenged Mr Brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said. Mr Prescott said MPs were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports.\n\"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today on Tuesday. Mr Prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government. But he argued Mr Blair and Mr Brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services.\nThe new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. He had then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from Cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked. Mr Blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while Mr Brown says he will not let \"gossip\" distract him from helping a unified election campaign. The Conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the Liberal Democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government.",
    "Yukos will return to a US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.\nYukos has said it will sue Baikal and others involved in the sale of Yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to have Baikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored a US court order last week blocking the sale. Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear.\nRussian newspapers have claimed that Baikal - which bought the Yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) on Sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with Surgutneftegas, Russia's fourth-biggest oil producer. Many observers believe that the unit, which produces 60% of Yukos' oil output, could ultimately fall into the hands of Surgutneftegas or even Gazprom, the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.\nThe Russian government forced the sale of Yukos' most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. Yukos' US lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of US bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. On Wednesday, Yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group. \"We believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us,\" Yukos spokesman Mike Lake told Agence France Press. \"If it exports that oil, it will be marketing a stolen product,\" he added. The future ownership of Yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that Baikal was established as a front for other interests.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, President Putin said Baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other Russian energy firms interested in the development of Yuganskneftegas. President Putin also suggested that China's National Petroleum Corporation could play a role in the unit's future after signing a commercial agreement with Gazprom to work on joint energy projects. Yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company. Commentators and Yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a government campaign to destroy it because of the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.",
    "Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.\nThe Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be \"limited\". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and \"add-ons\" that the software giant offers.\nPeople who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.\nMicrosoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. \"It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,\" he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. \"China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,\" said Mr Cluley.",
    "The classic film It's A Wonderful Life is to be turned into a musical by the producer of the controversial hit show Jerry Springer - The Opera.\nFrank Capra's 1946 movie starring James Stewart, is being turned into a £7m musical by producer Jon Thoday. He is working with Steve Brown, who wrote the award-winning musical Spend Spend Spend. A spokeswoman said the plans were in the \"very early stages\", with no cast, opening date or theatre announced.\nA series of workshops have been held in London, and on Wednesday a cast of singers unveiled the musical to a select group of potential investors. Mr Thoday said the idea of turning the film into a musical had been an ambition of his for almost 20 years. It's a Wonderful Life was based on a short story, The Greatest Gift, by Philip van Doren Stern. Mr Thoday managed to buy the rights to the story from Van Doren Stern's family in 1999, following Mr Brown's success with Spend Spend Spend. He later secured the film rights from Paramount, enabling them to use the title It's A Wonderful Life.",
    "Japanese electronics firm Hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called Emiew, to challenge Honda's Asimo and Sony's Qrio robots.\nHitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) Emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet. Two wheel-based Emiews, Pal and Chum, introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in Japan. The robots will be guests at the World Expo later this month. Sony and Honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics. Explaining why Hitachi's Emiew used wheels instead of feet, Toshihiko Horiuchi, from Hitachi's Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, said: \"We aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people.\" \"We want to make the robots useful for people ... If the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated.\" Emiew - Excellent Mobility and Interactive Existence as Workmate - can move at 3.7m/h. Its \"wheel feet\" resemble the bottom half of a Segway scooter. With sensors on the head, waist, and near the wheels, Pal and Chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. \"I want to be able to walk about in places like Shinjuku and Shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars,\" Pal told reporters. Hitachi said Pal and Chum, which have a vocabulary of about 100 words, could be \"trained\" for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years.\nRobotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. At the recent AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) annual meeting in Washington DC, researchers showed off bipedal designs. The three designs, each built by a different research group, use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait.\nSony and Honda have both used humanoid robots, which are not commercially available, as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. Honda's Asimo was \"born\" five years ago. Since then, Honda and Sony's Qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. Asimo, has visited the UK, Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Ireland as part of a world tour. Sony's Qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs. But its record was beaten by Asimo. It is capable of 3km/h, which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as Qrio. Last year, car maker Toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. By 2007, it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million \"entertainment and leisure\" robots in homes, compared to about 137,000 currently, according to the United Nations (UN). By the end of that year, 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes, said the report by the UN Economic Commission for Europe and the International Federation of Robotics. Hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market.",
    "The US budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (£197bn) this year, officials said on Tuesday.\nThe cost of military operations still needs to be factored in, with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red. Past Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. In recent months, the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. In November, the gap between US exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure. The CBO says it envisages a further \"orderly\" decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. But the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost US economic growth.\nThe budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 September 2004, after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year. The CBO also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections. However, analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president's plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. The figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. Republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 September attacks and ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of President George W Bush's election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. But Democrats have accused the president of excluding Iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit, a charge which the administration denies. On Tuesday, the US administration asked Congress for additional funds for military operations.",

A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said there were no plans to sell the channel.\nHe added that primary legislation would be required for the station to be sold off, which the government was not intending to introduce. Brookside was axed in 2003 after its ratings slumped from a peak of seven million to just 1.5 million.

    "Venezuelan authorities have identified more than 500 farms, including 56 large estates, as idle as it continues with its controversial land reform policy.\nUnder a 2001 land law, the government can tax or seize unused farm sites. A further 40,000 farms are yet to be inspected, the state's National Land Institute has told Associated Press. Vice president Jose Vicente Rangel has said farmers and ranchers with their titles in order and their lands productive have \"nothing to fear.\" Critics of the land reform policy claim president Hugo Chavez is trying to enforce a communist-style economic programme that ignores property rights and will damage the country. Land owners claim the National Land Institute has made mistakes in classifying lands as public or private.\nBut the government - Venezuela's largest land owner - say they are proceeding cautiously to prevent conflicts. In a statement, Mr Rangel said the land reform is not against the constitution, which permits private property, while stressing the efforts are to \"vindicate social and economically\" years of inequality in the country.\nOne property in conflict with the government is the El Charcote cattle ranch, run by Agroflora, a subsidiary of the UK food group Vestey. Agriculture minister Arnoldo Marquez told Reuters news agency the site's documents \"do not guarantee that this is a private land\". Administrators of the ranch, however, have complained that pro-Chavez squatters have taken over 80% of the property in the last four years, and the UK government has asked Venezuelan authorities to resolve the conflict. \"You should ask the company when they are going to put their papers in order and hand over the land that is not theirs,\" said Mr Marquez.",

Critics of the takeover have complained that the money could be better used by returning cash to shareholders. Deutsche Boerse also said profit in the three months to 31 December was 120.7m euros ($158.8m; £83.3m).

    "Asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the Asian tsunami and floods.\nWorld Bank president James Wolfensohn has said his agency is \"only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster\" and its economic impact. The tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit. Some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. Millions have been left homeless, while businesses and infrastructure have been washed away.\nEconomists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.\nIn Sri Lanka, some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. For Thailand, that figure is much lower at 0.1%. Governments are expected to take steps, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending, to facilitate a recovery.\n\"With the enormous displacement of people...there will be a serious relaxation of fiscal policy,\" Glenn Maguire, chief economist for the region at Societe Generale, told Agence France Presse. \"The economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005,\" he said. \"First and foremost this is a human tragedy.\" India's economy, however, is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. The regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004. But India now faces other problems, with aid workers under pressure to ensure a clean supply of water and sanitation to prevent an outbreak of disease.\nThailand's Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). Analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country's tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit. Thailand's fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by Sunday's 9.0 magnitude earthquake, which sent huge waves from Malaysia to Africa. Malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be \"significant\", Agence France Presse reported. Rapid rebuilding will be key to limiting the impact of the tragedy. \"In three months, we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces,\" said Juthamas Siriwan, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. The outlook for Sri Lanka is less optimistic, with analysts predicting that the country's tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly. Tourism is a vital to many developing countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).",
    "Ocean's Twelve, the crime caper sequel starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, has gone straight to number one in the US box office chart.\nIt took $40.8m (£21m) in weekend ticket sales, according to studio estimates. The sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across Europe. It knocked last week's number one, National Treasure, into third place. Wesley Snipes' Blade: Trinity was in second, taking $16.1m (£8.4m). Rounding out the top five was animated fable The Polar Express, starring Tom Hanks, and festive comedy Christmas with the Kranks.\nOcean's Twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a December release in the US, after the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean's Eleven which took $38.1m (£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (£95.8m) in total. A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean's Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh. Soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites Clooney, Pitt and Roberts with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the all-star cast. \"It's just a fun, good holiday movie,\" said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Bros. However, US critics were less complimentary about the $110m (£57.2m) project, with the Los Angeles Times labelling it a \"dispiriting vanity project\".

The division was tasked with improving US defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats. Reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation.\nMr Yoran took up his post in September 2003 and his first task was to get the Cyber Security Division up and running. The organisation had a staff of about 60 people and a budget of about $80m (£44.54m). The division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make US networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses, worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace.\nIn the last 12 months Mr Yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur. The warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks. The Cyber Security Division also audited US government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network. The next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers. Mr Yoran's division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals. Despite this success Mr Yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week, reportedly only giving one day's notice to bosses at the Department of Homeland Security. \"Amit Yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year, and we appreciate his efforts in starting the department's cybersecurity program,\" said a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman. Some reports have suggested that Mr Yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net-based threats in the wider homeland organisation. An attempt by US politicians to pass a law to promote Mr Yoran and raise the profile of his department's work is now mired in Congress.",
    "Oil prices carried on rising on Wednesday after cold weather on both sides of the North Atlantic pushed US crude prices to four-month highs.\nFreezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls took crude oil prices past $50 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since November. Declines in the dollar have also contributed to the rising oil price. US crude was trading at $51.39 at 0710 GMT in Asian electronic trade on Wednesday. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 at $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that, given such high prices, the cartel saw no reason to cut its output.\nAlthough below last year's peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004's average of $41.48. Brent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close.\nMuch of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. \"The primary factor is the weak dollar,\" said Victor Shum, a Singapore-based analyst with Purvin and Gertz. Expectations that a rebound in the dollar would halt the oil price rise were not immediately borne out on Wednesday morning, as oil prices carried on upwards as the dollar strengthened against the euro, the pound and the yen.\nSeveral Opec members said on Tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. \"I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,\" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters. \"I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,\" he added.",
    "Tony Blair has dismissed reports he told Gordon Brown he would quit before the next general election.\n\"You don't do deals over jobs like this,\" the prime minister told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme. According to a new book, Brown's Britain, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004. Mr Blair said the claims were \"reheated from six months ago\" and that he was concentrating on running the country. Mr Blair said: \"I've dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't.\n\"What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.\" The book, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston and serialised in the newspaper, said the pair had \"mutual animosity and contempt\" for each other.\nIt claims Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party. And that at a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott he told Mr Brown of his intention to stand down. According to Mr Peston the prime minister said: \"Help me to get through the year and I will then stand down.\" But he then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.\nMr Peston told BBC News: \"My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. \"What the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. \"I think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright, but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.\" But, in a wide-ranging BBC interview covering issues such as the Asian tsunami disaster, the Middle East peace process and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair said: \"When you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you. \"All sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims.\" He admitted to a \"sense of frustration\" about the allegations which he said had been made \"countless times\".\nThere has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami. These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blair's decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa. There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster. But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a \"load of nonsense\". Former welfare minister Frank Field MP said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown, but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so.\nTory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of \"squabbling like schoolboys\". He told Sky News' Sunday with Adam Boulton: \"This is the politics of the playground and Britain really does deserve better.\" The Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was \"getting in the way of good government\". \"Either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election.\" During the interview Mr Blair also said the former home secretary David Blunkett would play a \"big role\" at the general election.",
    "England coach Andy Robinson says English rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players' careers.\nHe will be without a host of big names for the Six Nations as the intensity of professional rugby union hits players. \"Injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the English season,\" Robinson told BBC Sport. \"I think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers.\" Robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the Six Nations with the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Will Greenwood injured.\nRugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago. As a result three of the major stakeholders in English rugby have launched an \"injury audit\" to find out how players are coping. The audit is jointly funded by the Professional Rugby Players' Association, the Rugby Football Union and Premier Rugby. As far as Robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored. \"I think there's an injury audit coming out in March that's got some great information in there that I think everybody in the English game has got to look at,\" he said. \"If we don't the situation is going to get worse and not better, so I think rugby as a whole has got to look at this.\"",
    "Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a \"super union\" of two million members.\nThe move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that \"nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda\" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday. Amicus's executive was due to meet in any case although the TGWU is holding specially scheduled talks.",
    "Actress Nicole Kidman has won a restraining order against two paparazzi photographers who she claims left her fearful of leaving her Sydney mansion.\nThe Oscar-winning star took action against Jamie Fawcett and Ben McDonald after a bugging device was found outside her home earlier this week. Lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device. The Australian actress is currently in Sydney to film her latest movie, Eucalyptus, with Russell Crowe. Kidman was prompted to take action following a reported high-speed car chase with members of the paparazzi in Sydney last weekend.\nAccording to local newspaper the Daily Telegraph, the incident involved paparazzi driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road in pursuit of Kidman's vehicle. Lawyers for Mr Fawcett and Mr McDonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase. Kidman sought the \"apprehended violence\" orders - normally used in Australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents - after being advised to do so by local police. \"Nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that,\" said Kidman's publicist Wendy Day. \"However, these are specific actions against two individuals who, over a period of time, have caused her to feel threatened, intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety.\" Magistrate Lee Gilmore, who issued the restraining order at Waverley Local Court in Sydney, said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour. \"Miss Kidman says she's willing to put up with some of it, but it's gone beyond that,\" she said. \"I do believe the allegation in relation to the driving is a serious issue.\"",
    "Oracle has announced it is cutting about 5,000 jobs following the completion of its $10.3bn takeover of its smaller rival Peoplesoft last week.\nThe company said it would retain more than 90% of Peoplesoft product development and product support staff. The cuts will affect about 9% of the 55,000 staff of the combined companies. Oracle's 18-month fight to acquire Peoplesoft was one of the most drawn-out and hard-fought US takeover battles of recent times. The merged companies are set to be a major force in the enterprise software market, second only in size to Germany's SAP.\nIn a statement, Oracle said it began notifying staff of redundancies on Friday and the process would continue over the next 10 days. \"By retaining the vast majority of Peoplesoft technical staff, Oracle will have the resources to deliver on the development and support commitments we have made to Peoplesoft customers over the last 18 months,\" Oracle's chief executive Larry Ellison said in a statement.\nCorrespondents say 6,000 job losses had been expected - and some suggest more cuts may be announced in future. They say Mr Ellison may be trying to placate Peoplesoft customers riled by Oracle's determined takeover strategy. Hours before Friday's announcement, there was a funereal air at Peoplesoft's headquarters, reported AP news agency. A Peoplesoft sign had been turned into shrine to the company, with flowers, candles and company memorabilia. \"We're mourning the passing of a great company,\" the agency quoted Peoplesoft worker David Ogden as saying. Other employees said they would rather be sacked than work for Oracle. \"The new company is going to be totally different,\" said Anil Aggarwal, Peoplesoft's director of database markets. \"Peoplesoft had an easygoing, relaxed atmosphere. Oracle has an edgy, aggressive atmosphere that's not conducive to innovative production.\" On the news, Oracle shares rose 15 cents - 1.1% - on Nasdaq. In after-hours trading the shares did not move.",
    "The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.\nThe Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn. The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn. The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.\nDemocrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.",
    "Thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in England and Wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.\nThe Countryside Alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal, but vowed to stay within the law. Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. One anti-hunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in Kent.\nThe man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the East Kent Hunt, near Ashford. In Wiltshire, police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs. The group, from South Wales and Ireland, have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.\nIt is believed more than 270 hunts went out on Saturday, just one day after the ban came in.\nThey were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country, with actor Jeremy Irons and former minister Kate Hoey among the supporters. Anti-hunt groups - such as the League Against Cruel Sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.\nMike Hobday, from the league, said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police. \"Our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law, many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting. \"However, we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across Britain.\" BBC correspondent Simon Hall at Postbridge on Dartmoor in the West Country said 2,000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.\nAnd the BBC's Sarah Mukherjee, with the Beaufort Hunt in Badminton, Gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt, with 150 on horseback. Tom Heap, BBC rural affairs correspondent, said it appeared that hunstman had, for now, been sticking to the new rules. And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday, he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.\nBefore riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: \"We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned.\" Judith Moritz, in Melton Mowbray, said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of Leicestershire, but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers. The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was \"impossibly difficult to determine\" and open to different interpretations.\nChief executive Simon Hart said: \"There has been hunting in England for 700 years. This [ban] may take two or three years, perhaps two or three months, to unpick. \"It will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service, as broadcasters say.\" Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed. Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts. The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law. He said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police \"in the near future\" to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.",
    "The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.\nThe Public and Commercial Services Union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.\nPCS leader Mark Serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.\n\"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\" BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented \"a formidable force\" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election. A stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.\nOpposition to raising the retirement age is \"one thing all the unions are agreed on\", our correspondent added. Unison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night. Our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations. There was \"some possibility\" of the strike action being avoided, he added.",
    "Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the \"stakes are too high\" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.\nThe chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 May - would give a \"clear and fundamental\" choice between Labour investment and Tory cuts. He told his party's spring conference the Tories must not be allowed to win. The Conservatives and Lib Dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under Labour.\nTo a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, Mr Brown accused shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country. Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: \"I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. \"Never again Tory boom and bust.\n\"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more.\" Turning to the economy, the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.\nHe also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. And he promised help to get young people on the property ladder. \"My message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto,\" he said. \"And the next Labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers' initiative.\" In the speech, which prompted a standing ovation, he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.\nHe also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. Responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, George Osborne, said: \"This was more talk from Gordon Brown. \"We've heard it all before. Instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past. \"He completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans. \"There will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the Conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\"\nLiberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable warned the picture was not as rosy as Mr Brown would like to portray it. \"For all his trumpeting of Labour's management of the economy, Gordon Brown's record is very mixed,\" he said. \"Gordon Brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy, a system which subjects millions of people to means testing, and a system of taxation which is extremely complex. \"For all his positive words, Gordon Brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon, not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation.\" Also in Gateshead, the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign. Mr Blair told the audience he believed the Iraq war would have made Britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible, but not before the job was done. He also said he wanted to carry on as PM \"because I still think that there are big changes our country needs\".",

Don't worry we've got it,\" Edelman told BBC Sport. \"Hopefully, we'll spend it this summer and in the coming years. Arsene attends all our board meetings and he knows our finances are very strong.\"\nEdelman added that it was pointless having a brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings. \"Its great to have nice, new surroundings, but if the team aren't performing on the pitch, then there isn't great respect in having a fabulous stadium,\" he said. \"It's important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place, before we began on the stadium.\"",
    "Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer.\nHe had to settle for bronze in Greece behind fellow American Justin Gatlin and Francis Obikwelu of Portugal. \"It really hurts to look at that medal. It was my mistake. I lost because of the things I did,\" said Greene, who races in Birmingham on Friday. \"It's never going to happen again. My goal - I'm going to win the worlds.\" Greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind Gatlin, who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. \"In my semi-final race, I should have won the race but I was conserving energy. \"That's when Francis Obikwelu came up and I took third because I didn't know he was there. \"I believe that's what put me in lane seven in the final and, while I was in lane seven, I couldn't feel anything in the race.\n\"I just felt like I was running all alone. \"I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me.\" Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg. The Kansas star is set to go head-to-head with Lewis-Francis again at Friday's Norwich Union Grand Prix. The pair contest the 60m, the distance over which Greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds. He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August. Greene believes Gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in Finland. But he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown. \"There's always someone else coming. I think when I was coming up I would say there was me and Ato (Boldon) in the young crowd,\" Greene said. \"Now you've got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time.\"",
    "Charlie Simpson took his new band Fightstar to the stage on Friday night, just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band Busted.\nHe was greeted by a sell-out crowd at the University of Warwick. Confirmation of Busted's long-rumoured split had come earlier in the day, when Simpson held a press conference in London with bandmates Matt Willis and James Bourne. All three band members stressed that the break up was amicable, although Bourne admitted he was \"devastated\" to hear of Simpson's departure. \"This has been a really difficult decision,\" 19-year-old Simpson revealed, \"I hope the fans will understand.\"\nWhile Simpson declared he would look back with pride on Busted's enormous success, his focus turned immediately to Fightstar, with Friday's press conference coinciding with the start of the band's 13-date tour of the UK. Fuelled by this news, all 1,400 tickets to see Charlie's first post-Busted live appearance - at the University of Warwick's Student Union - sold out rapidly. Mike Eccleshall, the venue's Promotions Coordinator, said: \"Tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days, but sales went mad after the news broke. We had completely sold out by 4pm.\"\nWith queues outside the venue long and expectations high, the pressure was on Fightstar to impress. Although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country, they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students, the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any Busted concert. Gone were the screaming girls to which Simpson had become accustomed. Support act Brigade, fronted by Simpson's brother, played a short set first and were met with general approval. When Fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm, however, a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd.\nUnfortunately, the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as Simpson's guitar amplifier failed to work. As sound technicians rushed to fix it, other band members did their best to improvise. When they eventually got under way, Fightstar's blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. Far heavier and less commercial than Busted's chart-topping pop-punk, the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. Warwick student Helen Clutterbuck admitted: \"I came to check out Fightstar because of all the controversy. \"I've never heard them before, but I'm pretty impressed.\" Less impressed were fellow students Ryan Crabbe and Gordon Rennie, who observed, \"With Fightstar, Charlie has clearly progressed from Busted's sound, but they're still not very inspiring.\" Fightstar played for around 45 minutes, showcasing material from their forthcoming EP called They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, due for release in February.",
    "India's biggest carmaker Maruti has reported a sharp increase in quarterly profit after a booming economy and low interest rates boosted demand.\nNet profit surged 70% to 2.39bn rupees ($54.98m; £29.32m) in the last three months of 2004 compared with 1.41bn rupees a year earlier. Total sales were 30.1bn rupees, up 27% from the same 2004 period. Maruti accounts for half of India's domestic car sales, luring consumers with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles.\nDemand in India also has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said.\nFigures show that only eight people per thousand are car owners. Maruti beat market expectations despite an increase in raw materials costs. The company, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki, said an increase in steel and other raw material prices was partially offset by cost cutting. Sales in the fiscal third quarter, including vans and utility vehicles, rose by 17.8% to 136.069 units. Maruti is not the only company benefiting as Indian's economic growth gives consumer greater spending power. Utility vehicle and tractor maker Mahindra has reported a 52% rise in net profit during the last three months of 2004. Profit was 1.33bn rupees compared with 874.2m rupees a year earlier.",
    "Harry Potter director Alfonso Cuaron has signed a three-year deal with Hollywood studio Warner Brothers, according to Variety trade magazine.\nThe Mexican film-maker, who directed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, will produce mainstream movies and smaller Spanish-language films. \"We had a wonderful experience with Alfonso on Harry Potter,\" Warner producer Jeff Robinov told Variety. Cuaron's other films include Mexican movie Y Tu Mama Tambien.\nThe 2001 rites-of-passage drama about two teenage boys who embark on a relationship with an older woman, brought Cuaron international attention - and box office glory.\nIt also won him and his brother Carlos, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Warner will distribute Cuaron's films in several languages outside the US. \"This deal will give us the opportunity to collaborate with Alfonso on movies that make the most of his artistry and vision, and continue to offer him the mainstream worldwide audiences that our studio provides so successfully,\" said Mr Robinov.\nHis first film for Warner Brothers was 1995's family fantasy movie A Little Princess. Based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, A Little Princess tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live in a New York boarding school when her widowed father enlists for war. After the erotic nature of Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third Harry Potter film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike.",
    "British actress Antonia Bernath is making her debut in Kisna - the Warrior Poet, marking a growing trend for non-Indian stars to appear in Bollywood films.\nDirected by Bollywood veteran Subhash Ghai, the film is set in the British Raj and Bernath plays an army general's daughter who falls in love with a rural boy, Kisna. \"I liked the fluid nature of film-making. We improvised quite a lot,\" says Bernath. \"At times it felt very chaotic but Mr Ghai was quite clear about what he wanted.\" Picked from more than 200 girls in an audition in London, Bernath cut short her education at Bristol's Old Vic Theatre School to take up the opportunity. It is not often that somebody gets to play the lead role straight out of a drama school. She spent three weeks learning Hindi and taking dance lessons. \"Initially, I was a bit sceptical about how people would respond to me,\" Bernath says. \"But I found the Hindi film industry very warm and encouraging. I even had a few offers before the work on Kisna was completed.\"\nFilms are one of India's biggest exports and those like Lagaan and Monsoon Wedding have broken the traditional boundaries of colour and culture. Spurred by this, Bollywood producers are trying to go global in all aspects of film-making, be it technical or artistic.\nFrom young heart-throbs like Nick Moran of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to model Sophie Dahl, many non-Indian stars want to make the most of this opportunity. \"Bollywood has truly gone global,\" says Taran Adarsh, editor of Indian film journal Trade Guide. \"Directors are now attempting to woo non-Asian audience to increase their share in the overseas film market.\" Kisna has been shot simultaneously in Hindi and English, with the English print shortened by an hour to accommodate the Western audience. The film even has a song composed in English by AR Rahman, the director of the popular West End musical, Bombay Dreams. \"Identification is a popular cinematic device. Use of European or American actors can be viewed as a step in that direction,\" says Adarsh.\nThe cast of Kisna also includes British actors Michael Maloney, Caroline Langrishe and Polly Adams.\nAnother actress, Annabelle Wallace, plays the lead role in a bilingual romantic comedy Dil Jo Bhi Kahey (Whatever the Heart Says), which also stars Indian screen legend Amitabh Bachchan. Actor and Producer Aamir Khan's forthcoming venture The Rising is set against the backdrop of the Indian mutiny of 1857, with British actor Toby Stephens in a key role. But it isn't only the Western actors looking eastwards.

    "Chancellor Gordon Brown will meet his golden economic rule \"with a margin to spare\", according to his former chief economic adviser.\nFormerly one of Mr Brown's closest Treasury aides, Ed Balls hinted at a Budget giveaway on 16 March. He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. Any rate rise ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning, he added. Last July, Mr Balls won the right to step down from his Treasury position and run for parliament, defending the Labour stronghold of Normanton in West Yorkshire.\nMr Balls rejected the allegation that Mr Brown had been sidelined in the election campaign, saying he was playing a \"different\" role to the one he played in the last two elections. He rejected speculation that Mr Brown was considering becoming Foreign Secretary, saying his recent travels had been linked to efforts to boost international development. Gordon Brown's decision to announce the date of the Budget while on a trip to China was a \"sensible thing to do\", since he was talking about skills and investment at the time, Mr Balls told the BBC. Commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise, he said it was not within the remit of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to factor a potential election into its rate decisions. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed that house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"I don't believe it would be a big election issue in Britain or a problem for Labour,\" Mr Balls said. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May as the likely day.",
    "All Blacks captain Tama Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour.\nBut Umaga, in England for Saturday's IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told BBC Sport: \"It's potentially the most fearsome line-up I've ever come up against. They're awesome. \"But I'd back us all the way to beat them when they come over.\" Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month.\nWhen Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former England players. But Umaga said: \"He'd be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. \"Don't get me wrong, England have got a lot of talented guys and I'm sure there are some of them who'll make the Lions Test XV. \"But you can't disguise Wales and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they've scored have been great. I'll admit it'll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O'Driscoll.\"\nUmaga will meet O'Driscoll in Saturday's Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side. O'Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. \"It'll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,\" Umaga said. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was immense, calling it \"the biggest thing to hit New Zealand since Lord of the Rings\". He added: \"As players, it's enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it's not just us All Blacks - it's the talk of the country.\"\nUmaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday's charity game, which features a host of big names including George Gregan, Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. \"The second [Southern Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I didn't hesitate. It was great when New Zealand Rugby then gave me the all clear. \"Thankfully I didn't know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn't miss all the horrific reports on the news. \"There are so many people that were affected, are still affected and will be affected for a long time. It's just good to know we can do something minor to help out.\"\n- The match will be televised on BBC One at 1400 GMT on Saturday.",
    "Glenn Hoddle has been unveiled as the new Wolves manager.\nThe ex-England coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed Dave Jones, who was sacked after the club's poor start to the season. Wolves chairman Rick Hayward said: \"We're delighted Glenn is here. He has a six-month contract so we can test each other out and see if it works.\" Hoddle, who will work alongside Stuart Gray, has been out of the game since he was sacked by Spurs in 2003. Gray, who has been caretaker manager, was assistant boss when Hoddle was manager at Southampton. \"I'm delighted to be here,\" said Hoddle.\n\"I saw the massive potential that Wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the Premiership parallels my ambitions. \"Stuart Gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager. We've worked together at Southampton and I'm delighted to be back with him.\" Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey defended the decision to give Hoddle a short-term contract. \"We hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term,\" he said. \"Most managers want a four-year contract and then expect it to be paid off if it doesn't work out. \"For somebody of Glenn's calibre to come in on a short-term contract and put his reputation on the line, it demonstrates his commitment and self-belief and the potential he thinks is here.\" Hayward revealed that Hoddle was one of the first to be approached after Jones' departure. \"He was not available at the time because he was looking at various other things,\" he explained. \"Five weeks later we're back on track and this a tremendous opportunity for Wolves.\"\nHoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job. His spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. The 47-year-old later returned to management with Southampton, where he again succeeded Jones - as he has now done at Wolves. He engineered an upturn in Saints' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. That relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the London club early last season. Since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of France manager and had also been linked with a return to Southampton. Wolves are currently 17th in the Championship and have a home game against Millwall on Tuesday.",
    "Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned.\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to end its Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) on midnight of 31 December. Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\nIt added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.",
    "Former All Black star Jonah Lomu says he cannot wait to run out on the pitch for former England rugby union captain Martin Johnson's testimonial on 4 June.\nThe 29-year-old had a kidney transplant in July 2004 but will play his first full match for three years, leading a southern hemisphere side at Twickenham. \"I actually started training three weeks after my operation but I was very limited until a few months ago. \"Now it's basically bring it on!\" said the giant winger. \"The match on 4 June will be my first 15-man game but I have a training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and a whole lot of things,\" said Lomu. \"I have got so much energy since my operation that I train three times a day, six days a week.\n\"Mohammed Ali has always been my ideal. Coming back to rugby, people said 'you are dreaming' but it always starts off with a dream. \"It's up to you whether you want to make it a reality.\" Opinion has been divided on whether Lomu should attempt to return to the game after such a major operation. But when Lomu was asked whether he was taking a risk he replied: \"As much as someone going down the road being hit by a bus. \"There are a lot of people in the world with one kidney who just don't know it. \"I have talked this over, had a chat with the donor and this is to set my soul at peace and finish something I started in 1994 [when he made his All Blacks debut].\" At his lowest ebb Lomu was so ill he could barely walk, but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long-term target is to play for New Zealand again. \"The only person who saw me at my worst was my wife,\" he added. \"I used to take two steps and fall over but now I can run and it is all coming back, and a lot more quickly than I ever thought it would. \"To play for the All Blacks would be the highest honour I could get. That is the long-term goal and you have to start somewhere.\"",
    "Hollywood actors Samuel L Jackson and Ben Stiller have signed up for Ricky Gervais' new sitcom, the comedian has told BBC News.\nHe said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom Extras. They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\" Gervais told BBC News.\n\"It's not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.\n\"I didn't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven't even been asked. \"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore's part. I haven't been approached and I wouldn't take it anyway.\"\nHe said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \"twisted\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \"would sail pretty close to the bone\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \"A film will happen over the next three years but I don't want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn't be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\"",
    "Talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.\nFive public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain's biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.\nThe five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the \"less painful\" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. \"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\"\nUnison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.",
    "Singer Britney Spears is suing eight insurance companies that have refused to reimburse her for cancelling her 2004 world tour.\nThe pop star cancelled her Onyx Hotel tour last June after suffering a knee injury during a video shoot. She is now seeking to be reimbursed for the tour's £5m ($9.3m) costs in a claim filed at New York State Supreme Court. Seven London-based companies and an eighth Paris firm have been given up to 30 days to respond to the complaint.\nThe 22-year-old star initially missed a number of shows on the 82-date tour after injuring her knee during a show in Illinois last March. But she was rushed to hospital and needed surgery after a later incident while filming a video for her song Outrageous, leading her to cancel the rest of the tour, including dates in China. \"She obviously took a wrong step and blew out her knee,\" a Jive spokeswoman said at the time. \"It was an old dance injury.\" The legal submission described Spears as \"one of the most recognised performers in her industry\". The Onyx Hotel tour was cited as \"a highly crafted production which included the well-known music and dancing of Spears, supported by elaborate costumes, complex choreography as well as cutting-edge video production, lighting and other effects\". In September Spears married Kevin Federline, who had been a dancer on the aborted tour.",
    "Manchester City's Paul Bosvelt will find out \"within a month\" whether he is to be offered a new one-year deal.\nThe 34-year-old Dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and, although his age may count against him, he feels he can play on for another season. \"I told the club I would like to stay for one more year. They promised me an answer within the next month so I am waiting to see,\" he said. \"The main concern is my age but I think I have proved I am fit enough. Bosvelt joined City from Feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in England. But his professionalism and dedication impressed manager Kevin Keegan. \"He realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team. He is an unsung hero,\" said Keegan.",
    "The ultimate prize of 10 Downing Street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget, Gordon Brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.\nHe reached that milestone last June, when he overtook David Lloyd George, who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. How much longer Mr Brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: \"those who fail and those who get out in time.\") There are rumours he will be moved to the Foreign Office if Labour wins the general election. But, for now, Mr Brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.\nGordon Brown was born in Glasgow on 20 February 1951, the son of a Church of Scotland Minister in the small Fife town of Kirkcaldy. At 12, he was canvassing for Labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in Scotland. He achieved a first class degree in history from Edinburgh University, where he went on to complete a PhD. His early career was spent lecturing, working in television and making a name for himself in the Scottish Labour Party.\nHis first attempt to enter Westminster, for Edinburgh South in 1979, was thwarted by the present Tory spokesman on foreign affairs, Michael Ancram. But in 1983, he took Dunfermline East, a new constituency including Rosyth naval base, pit villages and coastal towns.\nEntering Westminster, he came to share an office with the newly elected MP for Sedgefield, Tony Blair. Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. He became shadow chancellor under John Smith's leadership in 1992. After the death of leader John Smith in 1994 he stood aside, agreeing to give Tony Blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the Granita restaurant in Islington.\nThe other part of the deal, that Mr Blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of Westminster legend. Mr Blair's supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. But if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, Mr Brown continued his devotion to politics. During the 1997 election campaign, he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day, six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.\nThis dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by Mr Brown's former girlfriend of five years, Princess Marguerite of Romania, the eldest daughter of ex-King Michael of Romania, who said a relationship with him was \"politics, politics, politics\".\nIf that was true then, Mr Brown, who married PR executive Sarah Macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. Their daughter Jennifer died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, 10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. A year later, in October 2003, the couple had a son - John - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. A trip to Africa earlier this year, to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations, also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.\nThe ideological differences between Mr Brown and Mr Blair remain relatively modest. The chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the NHS and is seen as being more \"Old Labour\" than Mr Blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. But their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the New Labour project. Yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict, with Mr Brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger Downing Street neighbour over the succession. Mr Blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful Mr Brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his Budget until the last possible minute. After a recent run of negative headlines, Labour MPs took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering, for the good of the party. Events like this, and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues, make it impossible to dismiss the Brown/Blair feud as just journalistic hearsay, cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of Westminster. How much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question.\nA truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by Blairite Alan Milburn being brought in over the head of Mr Brown to run the election campaign. But with the Tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that Mr Brown - using the Budget as a springboard - is to revitalise Labour's campaign. Amid all this it is easy to forget that Mr Brown remains the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader. There may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including Mr Milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that Mr Brown can. And Mr Blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given Mr Brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister's intention to \"serve a full third term\" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.",
    "The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline.\nBrazil's airport authority chief Carlos Wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save Varig, Brazil's flagship airline. However, the country's vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. Varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais ($2.3bn or £1.2bn). Asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country's Congress to discuss the airline's crisis, Mr Alencar replied: \"No, I don't think so. We will see.\"\nEarlier, Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week. \"In practice, it will be an intervention, although this is not the technical name used\", he said. An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. For that to happen Varig's main shareholder, the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline's employees, would have to be removed, Mr Wilson said. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. Varig, which operates in 18 countries apart from Brazil, has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country's economic downturn.\nThe depreciation of Brazil's currency has had a direct impact on the airline's dollar debt as well as some of its costs. Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the Brazilian economy. The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m), after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992. But the government can appeal the decision.",
    "Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer, has died.\nMr Raskin was one of the first employees at Apple and made many of the design decisions that made the Mac so distinctive when it was first released. He led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. The 1984 release of the Mac reflected Mr Raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use.\nMr Raskin joined Apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead the company's publications department. However, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.\nThe result was the 1984 Macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. Users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing, clicking and dragging. Although now in common use in almost all computers, these methods were pioneering when first used in the Macintosh. The GUI was developed by Xerox PARC, and used in its Star machine. But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer. \"His role on the Macintosh was the initiator of the project, so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him,\" said Andy Hertzfeld, an early Macintosh team member. Although Mr Raskin drove the team that created the Macintosh he did not stay at Apple to see it released. In 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with Apple's mercurial boss Steve Jobs. In 1982, Mr Raskin left Apple entirely. The Macintosh was reputedly named after Mr Raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. After leaving Apple, Mr Raskin founded another company called Information Appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. He was also an accomplished musician, played three instruments and conducted San Francisco's Chamber Opera Society. Mr Raskin was diagnosed in December 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 February at his home in California.",
    "The law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales is enforceable and \"very clear\", Alun Michael has said.\nThe rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law, which came into force on Friday, and pretended they were not. Some 270 hunts met legally on Saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds. But anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. Countryside Alliance chairman John Jackson said that Saturday had been a \"massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting\". People had turned out \"to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law\", he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed \"legally\" as far as he was aware.\nAlthough hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: \"There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting. \"The reality is that the law is very clear. You can't chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs, whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer. \"If people do so and pretend they're not it's going to become very clear. You can't hunt accidentally.\" Mr Michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. He said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy, the health service and their children's future than hunting.\nBut the League Against Cruel Sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. Thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across England and Wales on the first day of the ban, with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken. There were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in Wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the Hunting Act.\nThey have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. But Penny Little, who monitored the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, said she had witnessed \"gratuitous, spiteful killing of foxes\". If people tried to \"run circles around this law\" the only outcome would be that it was tightened up, she said. Mike Hobday, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. He said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. But Mr Jackson, who had been at the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, denied there was any intimidation.",

He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I had zero anxiety about getting this shot, I’m a perfectly healthy 26 year old male. However, I had a terrible experience getting the first vaccine. Two minutes after injection, my ears start ringing and I become lightheaded. Next, my vision starts to blacken and become distorted. This intensified for several minutes and I was sweating an insane amount. At this point I’m freaking tf out because I can’t see nor can I hear and I know I’m like the only person having this experience. I did not flag anyone down I just waited in panic hoping my senses would return. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was only 3 minutes, my vision started to return and I suddenly got freezing although I continued to sweat. I left feeling like I just had intercourse against my will, and I also did not tell anyone at the site. I now feel very reluctant to get the 2nd Pfizer dose and am overall just still shocked I had such a terrible experience. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I have told someone?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I don’t know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",
    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",
    "We’ve been in a relationship since 7 years now , there were a few months where we not in  contact because I wanted a break from this and also when things went wrong real bad  we had a break for 4 months but then got back . I’ve been trying to hold this relationship and make it all work since 8 months now and it’s been very rough which includes me crying since 4 months straight everyday , he gave me many traumatic experiences which are hard to forget till date like lying for every small to big thing , body insecurities where I felt inadequate unworthy.  Having  a good enough body but just a smaller chest with inverted nipples , he made me feel little about my 2 insecurities and never enough . I still held on until now but I’ve begun to question is it worth it ? Will someone love me better ? I used to be scared with the process of falling in love all over again but now my hurt in this relationship has gone so beyond that I don’t know , if putting an end to this relationship which is my everything is the best thing I can/should do .",
    "Sooo you know how every character has 3 lives in the Dream Smp? How did they get those 3 lives in the first place? What if the second and third lives are just copies of the FIRST life. You may say this makes no sense but how do you just die and come back all fine with all your memories? Also there is a book called the revive book on the server which only dream possesses and has been used TWICE. Once on Tommy and once on Henry his pet cow. Which shows that the revive book can be used multiple times and the person you used it on gains all their memories after revival. So what if you can revive the \"copies\" or your \"lives\" that you have lost through the revive book basically creating infinite copies of you with all your memories. I mean they have to go some where right? The dead have to go somewhere RIGHT? Comment on this post if you think this theory is viable or its just bs. Also I have another question that is how or who created/found the revive book and gave it to Jschlatt who then gave it to Dream?",
    "Every Sunday night, my girlfriend and I FaceTime each other in order talk about our week and bring up any unresolved issues. While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer. I said yes because I assumed it was urgent and it was only going to be a 1 or 2 minute call. 20 minutes go by and they’re still on the phone while I’m there on FaceTime with her and she’s having a whole conversation with him. I became pretty upset over this, so I hung up the call and messaged her saying to call me when she’s done. She then proceeded to FaceTime the guy and she told me they were just doing homework together. I don’t know what to think of this. Any advice would be helpful, like is this normal or appropriate?",
    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

I just got done copying my friend's work on things I was supposed to pass one whole semester ago but some works I still need to do I just can't copy. It's those activities where you take a video of yourself giving a speech or acting or something like that. I can't do it because I hate looking at myself and I can't muster up any will to do it. I just want to say to my teacher that i don't want to do it. It's stupid but I thought of using text to speech and just having a static image of my face, but i can't even do that cause the text to speech for my language is horrible. Do I just say that I won't pass it? I don't see myself graduating anyway whether or not I complete this activity.",

    "I recently got a job, pay's decent and kind of fun, but it has no benefits and is far from a forever job. I really like the owner and wouldn't want to screw him over when the time does come to leave. When accepting a new position, how do you go about the whole two week notice thing? Are employers actually cool with saying,\" Oh I can start in two weeks.\"? It feels to me like an employer might be upset or go with someone else if you can't start soon/immediately, but that may not really be the case in the professional world. I'm just not really sure how to tread that path as I've always had a period between each job, so have not had to deal with breaking it off with one company and beginning another at the same time.",
    "It’s getting so much worse I don’t want to leave my house but I’m too scared to stay alone. When there is a storm I panic and my stomach hurts so bad. Like even when there is slight rain or the clouds look weird I start panicking. I hate hearing noises except for my fan, phone and soft voices from the tv. Where I live tornados happen a lot and it scares me so much I don’t know how to deal with it. I always have really bad dreams of me dying in a storm, tornado or tsunami it happens to very day and it makes me not want to sleep. I have to wait for myself to pass out to actually get any sleep.

She refused to acknowlege that I have cancelled my phone service in December and that they overbilled my account. I even signed a new contract that removed the phone line from the account in December but she blantantly ignored that proof. I have called multiple times and was told that they were going to reflect in their system that the service was cancelled in December and that I would be issued a refund.  I have yet to receive my refund and this last representative refused to help me.  I am beyond frustrated with this company. What's worse is that Comcast is the only provider in my area so I am forced to deal with a company that is incompetent and lacks quality customer service.",

Just finished watching the latest 90 Day The Single Life and she is once again calling Mohamed trying to get yet another apology. It's been what, 7 years, since the whole relationship unraveled? She's asked for several apologies. None of the apologies have been sincere, and she just keeps going back for more. She'll never be satisfied. Obviously Mohamed feels no guilt. She's never going to get that apology from him. She just needs to get over the whole thing, close the chapter, and get on with her life. She's a total drama queen. It almost seems like she's a little obsessed with Mohamed. As much as I am not a Mohamed fan either, I actually think I feel sorry for him. She's that annoying cousin you can't get rid of.

    "Title pretty much explains it all, my cat hates his wet food. I know wet food is much better for cats than the dry stuff, but my little guys just won’t eat it 95% of the time, I put it out and he turns his head an walks away. I’ve tried many many different types of food, and he doesn’t like any of it. He absolutely loves the dry stuff though, sits there and meows and begs for it constantly. After a while of him not eating the wet stuff I usually end up caving and giving him the dry stuff cause, obviously, I don’t want him to starve. I know cats are supposed to eat the wet stuff, that’s where they get most of their fluids from and it’s just better in general, so I’d like to get him to eat it, but he just outright refuses most of the time. On the rare occasion he does eat it, he’ll just eat like half and then leave the rest. What the heck can I do? Should I just give up on the wet stuff and only give him dry? He does have a fancy little water fountain that I see him drinking out of, so I know he isn’t dehydrated, but the lack of eating good food is a bit concerning. He’s about 5 years old, and has kind of always been this way, but recently has gotten worse. I even bought him some special bowls because I was worried it might be whisker fatigue, but that hasn’t helped either. If anybody had any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",
    "Why exactly do you care how we choose to play your game? Why do you care how many legos we get and how fast we can murder the toughest enemies? Why do you care which classes and builds are the most popular? See, we already bought your full game and we liked it the way it was. You don't buy a car that you like, only for the salesman to come back later and ruin some of the best parts of your car that he already sold you. There's no microtransactions or DLC or anything else in this game that you still need to sell us. This is not some scammy F2P or live service game where devs nerf one thing to make the new cash cow more attractive and profitable. So yeah, I'm just really struggling to understand the logic behind all these nerfs here. You guys spent 5 years on your game and released it the way it is. We bought your game and liked it the way it was. So once again, why are you nerfing stuff? Did you guys hire a game designer from some F2P or live service game? Because this is the kind of stuff only they would do. Except it won't lead to profits for you, as there's nothing else to sell us. So you are only gonna lose players as a result.

    "So for the past couple of years I’ve gotten into a crazy bad habit of eating massive amounts of food late night. I’m not super active in working out but also not super out of shape from my eating habits. I’m 22, 6’0 213 pounds but I consume inhumane amounts of food late. I’ll go and get 6 different entree items from fast food joints at like 9 o clock at night and it makes me feel like shit. I’ll probably eat enough food for 2 or 3 people and not even think about it and I’ve tried dieting and can never seem to make it past a week or 2. I’ve left credit cards at home to insure I don’t go out and then I just started door dashing. Any advice on stopping this nasty habit?? My metabolism is only gonna get worse with age.

    "I got a bunch of money back from taxes today and I was excited because I wouldn’t have to worry about my bills. Then I decided to try to think of a way to treat myself. All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you. I’d give the whole sum up entirely to speak to you again or just to know if you were safe and happy. Yesterday was trans day of visibility I hope your day was safe and you had a good time. I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit. I still don’t know why you left but I would rather die than see you unhappy so I will keep this letter unsent.",
    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",

His pervert side is still annoying but i feel like it is author trying to be  funny but failing mostly. Otherwise he is really great later on even this situation when he said sorry to Mizuhara for not running after her made me sad for the guy and later on there where more moments where i really felt some emotions after him trying to open himself or trying to be brave.

    "Ages ago it has its battery changed; after it wouldn’t turn on with the battery plugged in nor would the battery take any charge. It has done little other than sit since unused since then. Recently I decided I’d try using it so I readied a bootable El Capitan usb as it’s hard drive is completely blank, but the MacBook wouldn’t turn on. I eventually found out that holding down the power button for 10 seconds and then plugging it in continuing to hold down the power button for another 10 seconds. When it does turn on the fans are full blast and whether it’s to El Capitan install, High Sierra install, internet recovery, or the hard drive from a know working MacBook it will only make it a little past halfway before shutting off and coming back on again only to repeat. If it is turned off anyway other than when it shuts itself off the 20 second power button thing has to be done again. I’ve tried an nvram/pram reset and the option+command+shift+power to no avail. On the inside there’s no evidence of water damage. I’ve been trying at it for two days now and I’m out of ideas as to what the problem could be.",
    "I feel so incredibly anxious. I can’t sit still. After a rollercoaster emotionally abusive relationship that lasted two years and after 1 year sharing an apartment together, I moved across the country for a while. After a month of not seeing him, I’m back. I’m seeing him tonight. The level of anxiety I feel is unreal. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without feeling nauseated with unease. We wanted to meet up to get closure for everything that happened, but it was a toxic relationship. He begged for me back a week ago and has been standoffish the last few days. He told me he’s incredibly depressed and wants to want to seek help, but it seems that he won’t. He’s erratic in his communication and seemingly his feelings toward me. He says he feels like it’s going to be weird to see each other and I feel the same, to an extent. Despite everything he’s done and everything that’s happened, I miss him and am excited to see him. I don’t know whether or not that’s wrong.. people who are close to me tell me that I shouldn’t see him at all. I can’t help but feel drawn to him, even if it’s for the last time.

Maybe they could have showed us a small glimp of the struggles people faced after the blip and the struggles the blip refugees are going through ,but none of it was hinted properly at all. It was just \"bad\" things that's happening and we're supposed to relate with that suddenly.",
    "I am like 90% sure Isayama was made to make the ending more digestable. Why, you ask? All we have to do is look at the Season 2 ED. EVERYTHING is a reference there, EVEN THE FUCKING BABY is in there. Do you know what was in there that we've never seen? The mass of people wandering away. Those surely had to be the collossals turning back. This in itself is not the reason why many people dislike the ending, but I can surely say that some things were fucked with, and I doubt that that was the only one. I can even imagine some executive telling him literally after 138 that \"yeah man your shits fucked up no way we can have those characters die. figure it out\" Jean and Connie were brought back without even them getting brought back. They just kind of.. appeared? I don't know, maybe it's just my last dose of copium, but I am convinced that this was not that was envisioned.",
    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it. It feels so good to have purpose again in my life and to seek out these challenges that are hard instead of running away from the hard things like I use to do.",
    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I know that I am overly quiet in social situations, and that it’s because a lot of the time I overthink anything I might say. Most of the time it keeps me from saying anything at all. I feel like it makes people think I’m stuck up or unapproachable. People tend to fill in the blanks if you know what I mean. A lot of people will say I should try not to think so much and just say the first thing that comes to mind, but the thing is on those rare occasions where I don’t overthink too much and start to get comfortable so I actually talk to people I feel like a lot of the time I’m awkward, and in ways I can’t always quite put my finger on either. Like I put my foot in my mouth or overshare or just say odd things that people don’t know how to respond to. It all makes me cringe and go back into that overthinking mode and I feel socially inept. It makes me want to cry and be a hermit. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just need to vent. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "So this post is going to be somewhat of a jumbled mess as I dictated in my car as I’m driving from my iPhone but I just had a thought after reading some news about student loan forgiveness and with all the money that’s been spent through the government I think there’s an agenda in motion to cancel Fiat currency and the future is going to be only a Cryptocurrency somewhat like China just did. the United States will probably create its own so I don’t know where that leaves all the currencies that we have now but I think it’s important that we invest as much as we can into these currency’s now. I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can. And thank you for reading this if you did. And please comment your thoughts",
    "Honestly, the storyline I'm most worried about in the show is the shipwreck storyline with Matthias and Nina. All the other storylines in the show, including the crows, tie in to Alina's story, and are all connected. But I feel like, especially for new viewers, the Helnik storyline is just gonna feel like a random shipwreck in a random part of the world with two random characters who we don't really care about and have nothing to do with the main storyline with Alina. I just feel like it will feel a bit random and disconnected to the rest of the plot, especially considering all the other plots are connected. Maybe they have come up with a sensible way to believably tie them together, but even then it doesn't really look like nina and matthias is gonna interact with or even meet any of the other characters, unless it's just one scene at the beginning or the ending. I think I am most worried about the fact that new viewers are gonna be confused and not really care about the storyline at all.",
    "A car accident has recently left me without a car. I sustained a back/neck injury in the accident that has left me unable to work, or even sit/stand for more than 15 minutes at a time. Because of this I have found cooking and cleaning very difficult, almost impossible.  This had lead to me needing to order out almost every meal. Funds are dwindling and I'm getting extremely overwhelmed. I've been finding it very difficult to even keep trying. I've been in too much pain to effectively  take care of myself. My lease is expiring soon and I'm still looking for another place as my landlord is no longer renting the house I'm staying in. I'm just stuck in a rut and can't find a light at the end of the tunnel. Does anyone have any words of advice?",
    "Does anyone else ever feel like when you're having a hard time with something, you have no one to turn to and confide in? I have trouble opening up to people and even though I'm one of the first to recommend therapy, I'm not currently IN therapy even though I know I should be. I feel like I can't even talk to my partner because they keep recommending therapy and while I know they aren't my therapist sometimes I just need to talk to someone. I moved to a new state in order to be with my partner a few years ago and have struggled hard with making new friends, got a better paying but less satisfying job, we're even expecting our first kid soon. I feel so unimportant and completely unnecessary in my own life. It's been a while since I felt like this, last time was a few years after my mom died.

    "I don't want to be like this - I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life posting about my heartaches. I don't romanticize heartbreaks. I dont intentionally torture myself with thoughts of you, they just come to me - like a thief in the night, leaving me robbed and helpless. There's nothing sweet about this and I'm far too logical for this. I don't enjoy wracking my brain, trying to find words that would best describe how I feel - and every time failing because no words could really come close to how gut wrenching, soul destroying this is. I put into words how I feel because supposedly it helps - I haven't seen any result yet at all. There's only one thing that would help me - and that only comprises of three letters - YOU. I'm so fed up with myself. I have no fucking illusions, no grandiose dreams of getting back together, of a happily ever after. I've lived in the fairy tale we have created long enough - and I'm living now my reality. I'm tired to my bones of feeling this way...I just want to move on. I'm not harboring any negative thoughts about you or about myself - no blaming, it is what it is. Some relationships are not meant to last, and some people are not meant to be together. That is life and I'm well too aware of it. But fuuuuuck, the pain. I just want it to stop. Now. Not when I'm six feet under the ground and I wouldn't give a fuck at all. I don't want to continue going through this anymore. I have accepted that we are not meant to be. I'm not angry about that. Just please, let me be free of this pain. Cause I just can't anymore.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country.

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",

I just tried another movie tonight and I had it set to direct stream, but it failed converting again. I had the mode set to auto, so I changed it to force and it loaded up super fast but said it couldn't detect any audio. So it played the direct stream 35mbps 4k beautifully, but without sound.

    "This started before I went on vacation, but out of know where or it came on gradually a burning and discomfort pain inside my penis all the way up to the groin. The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",

The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",
    "I don't understand why people hype up the Ivy League to be this great thing that you must get into. I personally didn't apply to any. Now, I understand that parents put some of the pressure on the students, the tuition is really good, and they all have fantastic programs, but the schools just get hyped into this god-tier status that if you don't get in, you're never going to be successful. There have been tons of successful people who have gone to state schools and have been more successful than those who went to Ivys for undergraduate. If you don't believe me, do a quick google search. Furthermore, jobs don't care about where you went to undergraduate. They care about what experience you have. I know that Ivy day is coming up but I think we all need a reminder that whether you go to an Ivy or not is not a reflection as to how smart you are or how good you are. Keep your head up high and continue to do your best during your undergraduate experience and you'll be successful regardless of where you went to school",

For the past three years or so, I have been consistently getting choppy haircuts with chunky layers that need to be fixed every time. I just got a haircut yesterday. The top 2/3 of my hair looks fine, but the bottom third looks about half as thick and very choppy and bizarre. I’m going to have to cut it again. I haven’t been able to grow my hair past shoulder length because this keeps happening. There’s no way that I just have bad luck picking hair dressers.

My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

The allies had pushed me back almost to Berlin but then I mounted a massive counter attack on the Eastern front and reached all the way to Stalingrad which capitulated Russia.

But still I mounted a western front counter attack and pushed the allies back to the Benelux border. My attacks were green across the bord and the troops I had spent the last year preparing were making short work of the entente. But then suddenly out of nowhere I get hit by the Versailles treaty.

    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant. I have been complimented on the smell of my hair multiple times but I do not know how to make my body smell very good. Does anyone have any good body wash recommendations, body lotions, body oils, or perfumes to make yourself smell really good? Has anyone been complimented on smelling good all the time, and if so, what do you use? I have heard the Yves Saint Lauren perfume is amazing and I will buy that, but I was also thinking of just using something to smell good all the time naturally, not exactly with perfumes all the time. And by smelling good, I mean I really want people to constantly compliment me on how good I smell when they get closer, I am not really talking about just preventing from smelling bad or smelling neutral, or decent, but just smelling really good. Let me know, thank you.",
    "So last night my roommates, some friends, and I were having a good time having a bonfire. I decided to get wonky for the social gathering so I kept going back inside to my room to snort more ket. We have like 5 snakes and my roommate was showing one of our guests her snakes but one of them nudged the heat lamp keeping them warm when they were going back outside to the fire. Some time passes and I decided to go inside and snort some more ket. But when I go inside it smelled like something was burning but I didn't think much of it since we were having a bon fire. I proceeded to my room until I got near the reptile room and saw a bunch of smoke in that area. I freaked out and looked for the source and saw it had something to do with the heat lamp. I was so wonked I really didn't know what was starting to burn and catch on fire but I immediately ran back outside to inform my roommates something was catching on fire. They come inside and fixed the situation. Man, that was a close call. Thank god for my ketamine addiction and that I decided to get wonky af that night. I could've not have a place to live today if I didn't want to go back inside to continue the wonk. I just felt the need to share this with everyone. Thank you guys for listening to my experience last night. That was pretty scary when I finally thought about it.",

In the milliseconds before someone hugs me, I think through how I will have to hold my arms, if they are going one arm up and one down or both up or both down or a side hug. For high-fives, it’s the same issue. Some people will grab your hand when you high-five, others have a weird pull you in for a hug thing, some grab your hand after slapping it and shake it or something.

    "I bought my first truck recently. It belonged to my dad’s boss who pretty much babies his vehicles. Only he let this sit for about a year. I got a pretty good deal on it considering which I wouldn’t normally do if my dad didn’t trust the guy. I couldn’t take it home at first because we found a fuel line leak. We repaired it and we jumped it and it ran really good. Until it died on an exit ramp. We got it towed home and it hasn’t started since. We’ve replaced the batter and now the ignition coil. It will turn over but it just won’t start. It’s an electrical problem because I’m not getting sparks from the ignition coil, hence the replacement. But still nothing.

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",

    "Like two months ago I was using my newly acquired prostate vibrator, so to get things into perspective I was laying in my back inside my bed just chilling with the vibrator in while I tried to meditate and then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere a huge wave from my prostate flew through my whole body, it was so fucking pleasurable and only took like 4 seconds it even made me open my mouth as if I was about to moan, never had anything like it again, no cum came out it was just so good, after those pleasurable 4 seconds I thought \"I have no idea of what the fuck that was but I loved it\", that shit is the only reason I am still into prostate play cause after that until now I have felt nothing from it again not even a p wave I think, am I doing something wrong, and for God's sake someone tell me what the fuck that was",
    "One time I went to a party in Dahlonega, we started out at Taco Mac getting really drunk. I started getting really frisky so the two guys I was there with took me out back to where their truck was parked, turn down the music in there truck, and we started our own party. Of course I started taking my clothes off and dancing for everybody that had gathered. I brought one guy up on the bed of the truck with me and started putting his hands all over me. Eventually he started touching me and feeling me up, he took off my pants and started finger me in front of everybody. And his buddy got up on the truck push me down on my knees and stuck its dick in my mouth. They put me down on all fours and spit roasted me for a while... Then other people started climbing on the truck, a few other women took off their clothes and we all started sucking each other. Mostly us girls and the guys watching sucking on each other's tits, licking each other's pussy, trying to fit as many fingers as we could inside each other. But some guys were still up in the truck fucking us and putting bottles in us, and other things they were finding, not quite sure what was inside me at some points. But of course someone had to spoil the fun and eventually the cops showed and threatened to start arresting people if we didn’t pack it up.",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "Easter night. 98 years old. I got to hold her hand, touch her hair, and kiss her forehead. I got to say goodbye hours before she passed. I took pictures of her photos hanging on her walls, I took in the smell of her bedroom, I walked around her kitchen with family one last time. It was such a beautiful day, perfect weather, the sun was shining, birds were chirping. My aunt said to me \"when I hear the birds sing, I'll always remember mom.\" It broke my heart. I love my grandma. I love my family. Every family has its problems, I learned so much just from sitting and listening to my aunts and uncle talk that those problems just didn't matter. We are family. They had so much wisdom and love to give to me. They knew I wasn't very close with her, but they let me sit as long as I needed with her. I'm so happy I didn't wait any longer to see her. My brothers didn't get to say goodbye, only me. I feel lucky to have looked into those blue eyes one last time. I know she loved me and I love her. Rest easy Nan, tell Papa and Nick we love and miss them dearly.",
    "My son just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago. We always give kisses and hugs but I told him for awhile now that I don't want him to kiss me on the lips. I use the term inappropriate because it's the best way I know how to put it for him to understand. He sees me kiss my husband tonight and he said that I shouldn't kiss daddy on the lips. I explained that because mommy and daddy are husband and wife that it's okay. I told him that if he ever gets a wife, he can kiss her on the lips too. And he simply said \"or him\". I told him that is exactly right. He can love whoever he loves. I'm so proud that he even thought to say that because he has been around a few trans people but never a gay couple before. Love is love little dude. ❤",
    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "The depersonalisation/derealization is increasing. Ive been mentally ill since i was 13, im now 23. The worst its ever been was in 2016/2017, and now its coming back severely. In 2017 i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, but my psychiatrists evaluation was short and he suspected schizophrenic psychosis as well. In other words schizoaffective disorder. I have a lot of trauma and cptsd symptoms. Ive painted since i was 5, and i cant describe with words all of the fantasy and creativity i have stuck inside my head. My paintings went from realism mixed with surrealism and now an increase in surrealism because of my dreams. I dont relate to most in my age and it makes me lonely and isolated. Most people dont percieve the world like i do even though i know there are some out there. But i cant find them. As im writing this im experiencing deja vu. I remember writing this before. I can see into the future but no one would believe me if i told them even though i can even prove it sometimes. I feel like i might not make it past 30 and i feel like this world is more of an illusion than we like to admit, but it doesnt matter. Im just exhausted and i dont know what to do.

    "So I’m terribly , horridly , confused about my sexuality . I’m a very very curious person by nature . I’m curious about everything . I’m a 17 year old girl in a homophobic family if that’s relevant . However , my friends and schools have always been very friendly and I’ve never been told that gay people were wrong by them . Lots of my friends have been bi , and it’s made me curious . I’ve fantasized about girls when I was 14, and these fantasies were sexual in nature. I had “crushes” on girls though idk if I should call them that . It was more being shocked at their beauty , and kinda fantasizing about them . Although if I ever had to date a girl I’d pass . Kissing a girl seems interesting but not desirable . I’d do it out of curiosity idk if I’d legitimately like them . When I was around that age , I’d wanted to be gay . Like I know how weird that sounds but I’ve had pretty bad experiences with boys . Lots of very poor male role models in my life , and my mom is pretty anti guys and tells me how awful all men are , when I was growing up . Some lesbians try to make themselves like men and even marry one right ? Could the same thing happen in reverse ? Fake attraction fueled by desperation. As of now , I find women beautiful the way flowers are , its aesthetic . My “crush” was extremely beautiful but I wouldn’t do anything with her not really . I’m so confused .",
    "\"We knew that fans were hungry for more Survivor--and so were we. We looked at this group of players and thought, 'these guys came ready to play.' And as always, we have to stay a step ahead of them. So we decided, let's put the game on fast-forward. 'You think you can take your time figuring out your strategy and looking for idols? Think again. Everybody else is talking and somebody already found the idol. And if you blink, you're voted out.' I think it's the natural evolution of the game. The last few seasons, every single vote is complex. Every single Tribal Council, the gameplay is aggressive and has consequences. So this is almost a response to that. 'You wanna play hard from the beginning? Got it. We'll make it harder.'\"",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

My mom decided to move back in with my stepdad in there house. I told her I was going to cancel the couch because she does not need it since she’s moving back in with my stepdad. does that make me wrong?

    "so Im 21.  My friends are all my age or younger and we are in our 3rd year of college.  They LOVE to drink.  I have since fallen back from drinking, and that has made me realize that I have little to nothing in common with them.  I like my friends a lot, but recently I noticed they tend to ignore my invites to do things that dont involve going to booze late at night.  Even normal, fun things that most people would like to do they arent interested in and will ignore my offer.  I get liking to drink, but holy fuck it seems like its their whole life purpose to get drunk.  This is a very hard time to meet new people as well, so I kinda just feel lost.  When i talk to them sober/when were not drinking and partying our conversations suuuuuuuuck.  Its like I just met them but these are people ive known for 2+ years.  I got a job on the weekends, and so far Ive had more fun at work with my coworkers than I have with my friends.  It sucks.  Its so stupid that society expects college kids to all be wild, unhinged, borderline alcoholics.  Thats how they justify their near every day drinking, and they can never just have a couple its always about getting drunk.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, but I just needed to vent.",

Anyways, there was one guy who insisted on waiting until I was finished with my combo. There is no battle phase on my turn one, so after performing actions, I'd ask if he has a response and he'd say no. Ok, my board is set and I end on Bow Wow and one Prank Kid. He allows me to set backrow. I declare End Phase and he says he Nibs me at the end of my Main Phase. Can he do that, I gave him several chances within the main phase even after I completed my combo? The game ended up coming to a draw due to time and I feel like that Nib impacted the game more than it should've. I could also just be dumb, bust some clarification would be nice anyways.",

I've also seen examples of more extravagant craft, with long term thermal energy conversion generators, fully encrypted communication suites, ECM, small arms lockers, hazard suits, shields/armor, fabricators, and other equipment to the point of being like small colony ships to eke out a living on a nearby world until eventual rescue.

    "So, I just wanted to make a little post about the condition of atheists and how it's like being one in this country. First of all, it's quite disheartening to see that literally most of your country's population loathes you for your opinions and lack of belief in religion. In most social media groups of our country atheists are seen as outcasts. Most of us here are closeted atheists since there's a pretty massive chance that our families won't take this matter well. Moreover, there have been a number of brutal murders of atheists whose \"fault\" was expressing their opinions, which lead to their demise. In my opinion, freedom of speech doesn't exist here and it's despairing being in a country where you can be murdered for your opinions.",

Então tipo, eu falei pra ela, que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas direito, a gente tem a necessidade de comer um doce de vez em quando. Aí ela ficou puta, começou falar que eu preferia os doces do que os amigos, e na real, pra mim os dois caminham lado a lado na vida. Se eu não como doce eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho amigos, eu me sinto sozinho, o que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money.

    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.

    "Reading a translation of Anabasis, I noticed that having escaped the Army of Artaxerxes, and made it through the Armenian mountain passes, the Ten Thousand encounter a reoccurring trope amongst the various Pontic peoples they encounter. There are multiple instances where the local villages flee their homes in the face of the oncoming army, and hole up in Strongholds/Citadels. From the book, it is my understanding that these are not populated settlements and are only occupied to wait out hostile forces. It also seems that they were built collectively between multiple villages rather than each village having its own small strong-point. What other sources, if any, reference this practice? Is there any evidence for these small strongholds? In the book, they are often taken by the greeks without a prolonged siege or any equipment so how sophisticated could they have been?",

    "I think that Isayama is an incredible writer, the manga as a whole is proof of that. But a lot of people have problems with this final arc, namely that a lot of characters get plot armor. I think this is because Isayama made Eren and the founding Titan way too overpowered. With how powerful Eren is, of course there's going to be some plot armor for those who oppose him. Like why can't he just use paths to stop every single person who opposes him in his tracks? The only logical explanation could be that he didn't want to, which I guess we will find out in 139. Still, I just really feel that Isayama made the FT too super powerful, and then of course still had to make a compelling final conflict so he had to nerf Eren in some way and give the Alliance some plot armor moments. I think if he had maybe written the Founding Titan to not be as powerful as it is this final conflict would be much better. I'd love some opinions",

When I was working out then I followed a 40/30/30 macro split on the SAD diet anyways I did achieve solid results only speaking on my physique aesthetically real nutrition was definitely lacking. Anyways I stopped working out a little over 2 years ago however 4 months after I stopped lifting I discovered the wfpb diet and have never looked back since. So currently since I’ve eaten right I have been able to maintain a low body fat also my job is physical so I do lift and I’m active physically from that. So I have a solid starting base I’m currently skinny with some muscle not a lot but there is some anyways I want to put on 5 to 10 pounds at the max without getting fat if possible I would like to stay lean. What would be the best way to go about this with a wfpb way of eating. Any help would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance guys.",

Doğa ana dedikleri şey budur belki de?",
    "It’s just something I’ve been thinking about recently. I’m currently a high school student and I feel like people glamorize not sleeping. Like, you’ll always see people talking about how they only got three hours of sleep, like is that supposed to be impressive? Is that supposed to be a good thing? You do realize you’re just telling people you can’t take care of yourself, right? I’ve even seen people get made fun of for sleeping the Recommended 8 hours. Personally I’m more impressed when somebody is able to get all their school work done AND maintain a balanced sleep schedule I have a lot of respect for those people. Is this just a thing at my school or it universal? I’ve seen this happening since like, 5th grade lol",
    "This is like day 5 and i woke up this morning with like no withdrawal symptoms and no cravings. I basically just took supplements, drank a lot of water and coffee, and smoked weed at night. Honestly i think the supplements are what helped the most I strongly encourage who ever is quitting to take ashwagandha, Htp-5, and Rhodiola Rosea Extract two of each twice a day. Its been giving me the biggest boosts of serotonin and as i did feel the withdrawal symptoms this dramatically reduced them. I’m telling you if you are struggling take these and you will feel soo much better. And also smoke weed or take CBD if you like, it kinda takes the edge off. But i like these supplements so much I’ll probably take them for a long time",
    "Missing 411 cases fascinate me in part because they really come closest to feeling like the closest real-life analogue to a Cthulhu-esque horror. In the Cthulhu books, these types of beings were portrayed as completely alien and unfathomable, like there is no way to understand their intentions or desires, they are just on another level entirely. They are also irresistibly powerful, mere humans have no hope of overpowering them or defeating them. In Missing 411 cases, we have no idea why this is done to people and what they get out of it, but there is a clear intelligence to which victims are taken, when they are taken, and how they are taken. Also, the entity responsible seems to have no constraints, taking people even from crowded areas and always being able to avoid being witnessed by other people or even security cameras. The implications of this phenomena are utterly terrifying and fascinating.",
    "I have a notes folder in my phone full of story ideas, most of them never get started but when they do they are so brief I don't know where to go with them. For example, I want to write a love story about two almost opposite girls who unexpectedly find themselves within each other in a small rural area. I want to guide the two through the trials and tribulations of being LGBTQ+ in a small school/place that isn't accepting. They will be together in secret, but people will eventually find out. I also want to make the story about them, and how they find each other and their story. I just don't know where to start. Right now I have about 600 words but I'm unhappy with it, It doesn't make much sense.",
    "i am extremely new to this game and decided to look up some guides on who should i play as a beginner and what you had to do in the game, i came across jungling which i found very appealing and wanted to try out and i buy master yi to begin because i saw in a video that he is a decent jungler and an overall easy character with a straightforward kit,  but i always no matter the amoount of guides on how to jungle or how to take less damage, i always find myself having extremly low health after doing just one camp or two and i sometimes even die when i try to do one more camp, so i need someone from here that has played the game before and has jungled before to give me a more in-deph explanation and strategies on what to do, thank you",
    "Hi guys, I drink them both coffee &amp; energy drinks on a daily basis but they never really get me hyped the way they work for others, I think I’ve just developed an addiction and thats why I drink them. I’ve never understood how people can get jittery and hyped from them. I used to think my tolerance was just high, because every day I’d have at least two cups of coffee, both with 6 shots of espresso and at least one big Monster / other energy drink and it would just make me yawn constantly &amp; I’d feel like I’m about to fall asleep. It does help me focus better but doesn’t do much energy wise, which sucks because I’m an athlete and I would love to have something to boost my trainings. Anyone else have that problem with caffeine? Any recommendations for what to drink instead? I talked to my doc and she said its common to get that reaction from caffeine but wouldn’t recommend me to consume anything that would make me more hyper and I get that, my mind is already running all the time but I have to train twice a day six times a week and my body could really use some sorta energy boost sometimes. Thanks guys, would love to hear about your experience with caffeine",
    "Were you ever afraid of the dark? Did your imagination conjure up a wide variety of potential threats that would have the added advantage of darkness as an ally? Remember covering your head with a blanket as though that would somehow provide an additional layer of protection no matter how minuscule. Maybe you could have just a little less fear by not knowing the assault was underway.  Remember how hollow your mother's words were when she said 'There's nothing to be afraid of'. When you were a little older, she then explained to you that the dark is just the absence of photons, remember how the fear just dissipated. What are we afraid of now? Death, oblivion, complete annihilation? How are these concepts different from nothing? Are you still afraid of nothing? Nothing is absolute. Are you still afraid of the absolute?

It's difficult to explain the full premise but there are about four cultures the player encounters that all have very exaggerated attributes of modern society that is supposed to get the player to question their own reality and recognize a lot of the strange and counterintuitive behaviors of humans. I need resources that relate to our lack of individuality, the limits of our perception, consumerism, mob mentality, how culture and upbringing shape our world view and opinions, and the negative emotions that cloud our judgement and beliefs.

    "I work at a fast food place running the fryer, and I used to work at one running the drive thru. The work is fast paced and bitter at times. People at the speaker have not only the whole menu, but the opportunity to ask questions about it to the employee at the register. Pulling up to the window and adding to your order messes up the flow for both the window worker and the cook. Now the people behind you have to wait longer while the cook drops extra food with no notice and the cashier has to ring you up again. You messed up the flow for the workers and you're making it inconvenient for other customers. And as we all know, annoyed or angry customers take it out on employees sometimes. Congratulations, your extra order of fries or your added sandwich makes it harder on everyone because you're indecisive. Fast food wage is not worth that nonsense, so please stop.",

The devs have only released small statements or have sent out bot sorry messages about the issue, there will be a one-off-mass restoration for the characters affected but when that will be no one knows. This restoration will only work if the gear they restore is exactly what we all had on before the wipes, just giving us random purples and golds will do all of us no good and will be like were still naked. At least cyberpunk was playable, and anthem only destroyed the system not the countless hours put into a save.

    "I’m serving in the military and the work cycle I have is staying in camp for a week and then having one week off. The country I live in requires all males to undergo mandatory military conscription for two years and I’m slightly more than one year into the military service. At this point I’m so sick of this mundane lifestyle in camp because I’m doing guard duty most of the time. I can sleep well at home during the one week off because I’m free from the military. However, every night before I have to enter the camp for work I just can’t fall asleep. I would only sleep for a maximum of four-five hours and on a bad night I don’t sleep at all. I have a few sleepless nights in camp as well. I do not know the exact reason what’s keeping me awake, but I suspect it’s because of the lack of enthusiasm I have for the military as it is just too boring. I’m only entering university next year so there’s absolutely no goalsto pursue during this period of time. I feel like I’m just wasting my life away now. I just want to sleep but I just hate my life in the military as there’s nothing to look forward to the next day and this keeps me from falling asleep.",

But the thing is, I'm a transguy, and it kind of makes me uncomfortable with how feminine it is. I don't really do stuffed animals, and recently attempted getting rid of an old pink cat squishmallow that I got from a friend a year or so back, and I told my ma about it the day before last, before I was given easter stuff. I mentioned that it was super girly, and was far too feminine for my liking and that I was going to try to give it to my SO. She mentioned that she had gotten me one, which had me backpedaling q u i c k. I feel super guilty about not being super fond of it, and don't get me wrong, it's adorable, and I truly appreciate the thought that went behind it, and she even mentioned it was pride themed due to the rainbows. But I realistically don't know what I'll do with it. I had my other one hidden, out if sight out of mind style, and these are kinda expensive. This one was $10 which may not seem like a lot, but it seems like a lot to me, and I know they could put that money to better use than having it sit in my closet.

    "Hey guys. I'm a second-year biochemistry major and I'm interested in pursuing pharmacology in grad school. However, I'm not sure if I'm taking the right path and would like some advice. Essentially, I switched from a BS in chemistry to biochemistry despite my fascination with organic synthesis. I did this because I believed understanding the chemistry of biological systems would be more beneficial in pursuing pharmacology in grad school. More than anything, I want to study psychedelic substances and how they affect the CNS, but I also would love to carry out the synthesis of psychoactive drugs in addition to studying their biomolecular mechanism of action. I want to do what Hamilton Morris does, and what Dr. David Nichols and Alexander Shulgin did. Did I make a mistake choosing biochem?

    "Recap: I fell like a rag doll on my foot and injured myself. Particularly I had a bruise on top and the sole of my foot that was very painful. My husband is a physician and agreed that my foot was fractured, but also agreed with redditors that it was a Lisfranc fracture and would need close observation. I cannot thank enough the kind advice about lisfranc fractures. The X-ray revealed it was indeed a Lisfranc fracture and would require casting to maintain immobility, as well as no weight bearing for many weeks. Unfortunately, because I have Axonal Charcot Marie Tooth, this was my good leg. So currently I am bed bound until I once again bear weight on this foot, if ever. Since my neurological decline has been so rapid, I am forced to remain immobile for the foreseeable future. Life just handed me all of the lemons at once like the world’s suckiest lottery prize. Overall though, I am stable and safe, so life could be worse. Thank you again for caring enough to offer your wonderful advice. I really appreciate it.",
    "Guys, I’m finally at 10 gpd down from 25-30. It’s taken a while but I’ve slowly tapered. However I feel like I’m stuck in limbo. 3 months ago 10 gpd would be unheard of for me and seemed like SUCH a small amount. Now that I’m here I realize that’s great and all, but I’m still taking 10 gpd. I want it to be less, I’m getting kind of fed up with how long this is taking, I’m not trying to take another 4 months to get off completely from 10 gpd. How did you guys feel when you were at 10? Am I close to the finish line? Not even close, still have a far ways to go? Anyone know how quickly I can be done by tapering ? I’m sure if I CT I would still experience WD, I feel it slightly each morning until I dose 1.5 grams. I’ve been using kratom for the past 6-7 years.",
    "Hi all. So I received an FX-8350 as a gift and I made an OK build with it. Though I made the absolute stupid mistake of using m5a78lm-usb 3 motherboard from ASUS which have horrible VRMS and therefore when using the 8350 with this motherboard, it throttles the performance as soon as it hits 60° or above 50% usage. I decided that I will save up to buy the Asus M5A97 EVO R2.0... should I buy a different motherboard coz I don't want to make the same mistake. Also, cause the 8350 is basically a room heater, I decided that I might spend extra on the thermal grizzly conductonaut. But then the product page says not to use this paste with aluminium heatsink. Does anyone know if the 8350 has an aluminium heatsink?. Thanks.",
    "I always thought of sweet water as a circle. It evaporates, it rains, it is absorbed and used...  somehow in this process it changes state of aggregation and location but is not necessarily reduced in quantity, or is it? I understand that there is some amount of sweet water that is polluted in a way it cannot be cleaned anymore. Are those significant amounts? Is the amount of sweet water at a world level actually decreasing in significant amounts? If yes, where does it go? When we are told to save water is it to prevent water from being \"wasted\" because by using it somehow we decrease the amount of times it can be reused or for other reasons? Which ones? Or is there actually enough sweet water on a world scale and it is a allocation problem and not one of quantity?",

It’s so lonely with no gf and when i realized I couldn’t get one involuntarily when I was 16 I knew then thati would have a hard time.

I do notice sometimes that I get brief intense shooting itching sensations on my thighs and very mild itching and redness on my genitals, wondering if these are just very mild outbreaks or psychosomatic symptoms. My doctors insist that outbreaks are obvious but I’ve seen in some studies that “asymptomatic”carriers just don’t realize when they’re having outbreaks. Anyone else have mild outbreaks or am I trippin? Tempted to get a swab to see if I’m shedding but there aren’t any blisters or bumps. I wish there were at home swab tests so I could do it regularly and get an idea of how often I shed, my partner is negative so far but now that I know my results I’ve been feeling guilty.",

    "Why do girls and women ever post there? Almost all comments are sexual or creepy/pervy, or just mean. Not funny. So many also get a ton of unpleasant, at best, PMS. Why do we do this? Seriously. Guys will humiliate and be mean but why do girls and women subject themselves to this? Not blaming the girls/women but most posts end up with the same types of comments from misogynistic people. The guys posting there get funny comments and are not met with uncreative, mean insults. Especially when conventionally \"pretty\" girls or women post the comments are so much meaner. Dear girls and women please reconsider. Also I have a feeling that the amount of porn these boys and men watch make it impossible to see a photo of a girl/woman and not sexualize it.",
    "I don’t know how exactly to explain this, but when I was little, I used to get these breathing “bursts.” What I mean by that is there were times when I would breath in as if to take a deep breath, but instead of a normal deep breath it felt like I was breathing in happiness. Bare with me I know this sounds crazy. This was a feeling of all over calming, clean, comforting, burst of I don’t know what to call it. It would happen at different times like while was playing or other random times. It would happen maybe a couple of times a week from what I remember. All I know is that it happened regularly throughout my childhood but stopped sometime before my teen years. I’ve never felt it again. I think of this from time to time and wonder if maybe it was some sort of spiritual experience. I really don’t know but I’ve never met anyone else who has experienced this. Any thoughts? Any similar experiences???",
    "I'm late to it, but I just watched Netflix's I Am a Killer: Released. Basically, Dale Sigler did 30 years for shooting Subway employee John William Zeltner Jr to death during a robbery. He has been paroled, and now repeatedly asserts that he did it because John \"tried to blackmail him into having a homosexual relationship \", although nothing like that was presented at trial.Afterwards,  I searched posts about it to read about posters wanting to empathize or questioning if they should pity Dale. I had the exact opposite reaction. I was totally disgusted by his repeated use of homophobic sentiment to reframe himself as a victim. I get the impression he's using religion as something to create a new facade for himself. He clearly doesn't take responsibility for what he did, and when he speaks, it's as if some important piece of humanity is missing behind his eyes. I also noticed Albino Legend,, a white supremacy tattoo, on his hands.I realize much of my reaction was based on personal impressions. I do believe in second chances, but frankly,  I found it shocking how quickly this community seems to embrace him. He's taken in by a complete stranger and parishioners nod encouragingly when he tells his new reason for the killing. I'd have great trepidation about this person reoffending.

    "When anyone tries to get you to discount your internal truth in favor of what they’re trying to convince you is true, you can either betray yourself or honor yourself. No abuser ever tells their victims, “I’m here to abuse you.” Instead, they always try to win the trust of their victims by convincing them that what they’re trying to do to them is in their best interest. Socialists are abusers. Period. 100% of examples throughout history validate this. That ain’t gonna change no matter how much you like AOC’s underdog story.  Social media and big tech are trying to deceive you into being abused and believing it’s in your best interest because they care. I don’t know about you, but I choose to see it for what it is.

    "I realised today that we never actually got the love we deserved from our parents. I used to convince myself that “they weren’t that bad” and the love bombing stages made me think it was just “normal fighting” but it’s not. I grew up bullied as well and so neither school or home was my safe space which was the reason I read so much and threw myself into fictional worlds. Maladaptive daydreaming was my escape. It’s only recently that I have a healthy bunch of friends that I can say they’re my safe space especially since I still live with my parents but it’s a punch in the gut to think the people who are supposed to give you that unconditional healthy love that you can rely on and always come home to gave us the kind of love we have to spend the rest of our lives trying to unlearn and escape From. It’s incredibly damaging because then we tend to seek that healthy love in our romantic relationships and friendships to make up for what we never got as kids. We’re not supposed to seek it out like that it was supposed to been given to us by our parents but they never did. It’s hard to admit being unloved but that’s what it is.",

Like I know they probably explain later on in the story but I just can't even be bothered, second, why tf would they skip so much? They should of made a direct sequel to wolfenstein 2, why did they think skipping like 20 years was good? Wheres all the characters I know and love? And to be calling this Canon? Ruins everything, why is it online? Has no one learned from fallout 76? You cant take a beloved series and then make a online game, maybe if it was a spin off game I could maybe tolerate it, atleast with fallout 76 I can tolerate it, but not this, this is a mistake, I could care less about, what was there names? Soph and jess? I think? I just want to keep fighting the nazi's and expand the rebellion and kick ass as BJ, it's just so sad, I love wolfenstein TNO and 2 and when you take away the main character along with the people I actually care about, you ruin the game series, it makes me sad because I know truly believe that they cannot fix this, if I had a time machine I would go back in time and stop them from making a wolfenstein game 20 years or whatever in the future from the last game, what are your thoughts on this horrible game?",

    "I ordered the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G 512 GB in color Phantom Black originally back on March 2, 2021 from AT&amp;T. I finally received it on April 8 2021. I waited a very long time to get this particular model and I only found out about a delay because of chip shortages from Reddit. First of all to even remove the expandable memory slot and then have customers have to wait a lengthy amount of time for their order because they choose the 512GB version is insane. My cellphone carrier kept saying it was coming... it will be there in a couple of days etc. for the entire time. I told myself once I get it I will post it on Reddit  just so maybe I can end some frustration for anyone else waiting for their order.  The one good thing that I can say however is that I love this phone. It did not disappoint. I had used the Samsung Galaxy Note phones for at least 6 or 7 years. It was hard to get me away from the Note versions, had my Samsung Note 9 for the a little over 2 years. I had a lot of wear and tear on my phone so I did a lot if research to narrow down my next cellphone purchase choice. I am so glad I decided to get a different version this time. Samsung cellphones are my go to brand and will continue to be in the future. The Samsung Galaxy Ultra 5G phone is a definite winner. So many pros and a few cons but the features and specs are remarkable so I will no doubt recommend this brand to anyone who wants to purchase a new cellphone in the near future.",

I’ve only been here since the beginning of February but honestly the shitty scheduling and lack of work/life balance no matter how many times I bring up how I need less hours because I’m in school is just too much. I also have not felt like my store is a “safe space” for me, as I’m visibly not straight or cisgender and my coworkers as well as customers have been clocking me for it or talk about me behind my back and it’s really wearing me down and makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. I’d like to quit and preferably not have to physically hand a notice in or stay a full two weeks.

About a year ago, I got the urge to recover so we started grocery shopping together and eating our meals together. However, I relapsed shortly after and I’ve been restricting every day again. And though she’s never had issues with her eating patterns before, she’s now restricting with me. I never see her eating unless I’m eating too and if she says she’s hungry but I choose not to eat, she will change her mind as well. She’s also been working out more frequently and mentioning how much weight she’s losing. It’s added a ridiculous new amount of pressure on me because I feel like I’m being forced to recover in order to prevent her from getting sick. Does anyone relate??",

    "I’ve been listening to kpop for 3 years now and I never really watched kdramas up until last year well technically I have but only seen 3. The first one I watched was in 2019 and I never finished it and then I watched and finished two in 2020. My friend and everyone on the internet talks about the latest dramas some popular ones I’ve heard of is “what’s wrong with secretary kim” and “crash landing on you.” I guess when I got into kpop I was mainly focused on kpop so I never took the time to actually watch kdramas and I still don’t  to this day. I’ve seen stuff about how some people like for dramas to take their time with the plot and that it catches them off guard when things move to fast. And I feel like that’s why I don’t watch them because I get bored easily and if it takes to long to get to the point I’m not gonna finish it.

    "Honestly people who are gay Christians need to stop going through loop holes to try to not make homosexuality a sin in Christianity. The Bible has about six passages in which it can be taken as condemning homosexuality. I’m not arguing that Christians should attack gay people but I believe not calling it a sin in the Bible is off at best and disingenuous at worst. EVERY single verse is a mistranslation or has an alternative reasoning? And even if that was true most of the early church didn’t agree homosexuality wasn’t sinful. I think a better way to think is “the Bible says this but I still believe in God” or “I don’t care if being gay is a sin but I’m still a Christian” but throwing shotty reasoning isn’t doing you or anybody else any justice.",

    "I have been looking for RAM for MONTHS. I ordered some back in January and it is still backordered and my attempts to find some elsewhere have turned up empty.

I initially found some for around $140 a stick but while it has been on backorder the price has gone up $50 and the site doesn't lock in your price. So it will cost me $200 more than planned. I have on occasion found some RAM but only at $200+ a stick. I don't specifically need that model of RAM.

    "For a little over a month now, I’ve had these pressure/headaches on the left side of my head only. The pressure moves. Sometimes it is below my eye, sometimes in my upper jaw/cheek, sometimes below my eyebrow, on my eyebrow, temple, behind the ear, above the ear, and on the side of my head. When it first started, I saw my doctor and he said he saw fluid in my ear, which meant infection, and gave me an antibiotic. It didn’t help. He said it is allergy related and told me to take allergy meds, so I’ve also been doing a nasal spray and allergy med every day. Allegra until I ran out, now just an Amazon generic 10 mg. I went back, and he ordered a CT scan. He said CT scan showed “thickening” of the sinuses behind my eye and prescribed Amitriptyline, which has done nothing but make my heart race. I can’t even find anything online about that med and sinuses. This has been more than a month, the pain isn’t more than a 2-4 on the pain scale, but it’s exhausting. The only other allergy symptoms I have are drainage and sneezing. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to relieve it if so?",
    "every aspect of my life is determined by what other people want and how i can make them happy. i have terrible social anxiety so to compensate for it i focused on trying to do everything i could to not make other people uncomfortable, but i feel like i'm overly aware of it. i can't talk to people because i worry i might make them uncomfortable by it, even my closest friend. i can't make decisions because i don't want to upset or inconvenience other people because of it. hell i'm only still alive because other people would be upset. what's the point of living if it's entirely for others? people say \"think of the things that make you happy\", but i just can't pinpoint what legitimately makes me happy versus hobbies i adopted for other people. i live for a validation i have never and will never receive, and i fucking hate it.",
    "My mom found out of my eating disorder on my birthday in November and she then told my whole family, which embarrassed me. I've been struggling with bulimia since I was a pre-teen and before that, I had stopped eating and lost a lot of weight. But my whole family is insensitive to my feelings and I have to lie and say that I'm getting better. When I'm sad, my mom keeps telling me that I'm trying to be depressed, which is very insensitive. She thinks that it's easy to recover from something so traumatic for me. She also says that if she sends me to counseling or therapy, I'll have to eat 2000 calories per day. so I was wondering how therapy is because the last two years, I've never felt so low before. Thank you and have a nice day.",
    "So I went to elementary school and middle school in this one school district and I found it easy to make friends and I was always the top of my grade, the classes feeling super easy. But for high school my parents made me switch to another school district as their high school was one of the best in the state with lots of resources. The thing is, I would say I’m doing pretty well but the culture there is so that everyone tries so hard and it feels like everyone that I know has started their own club or community service while ranking highly in other clubs and sports and on top of that about 20 aps at the end of their senior year. I searched this up and apparently you are heavily compared to people at your high school. Right now I would say I’m on track to do the many aps but not much community service/clubs or anything to make me stand out. I know at my last school district this would already be super impressive and now that I’m already going to be a Junior I feel very lost and worried that I might’ve made a life changing mistake by switching schools. I still have friends from my last school district and O hear so many people getting into great schools with such little effort while I’m busting my butt off with like full aps and not even able to stand out because I don’t have the work ethic to go even further than that.",
    "So don't tell me where I heard it. It's a looooong story, kinda like a mystery. The Developer is coming back soon, and there's going to a massive update, some patches, and huge improvements to the main server. He's the one who is the mod of the multiverse, but he stepped down for a bit cuz one of his AI's said they could do a better job. The the current gameplay was kind of a troubleshooting phase, so that's what dark energy and dark matter is about. Anyways, you wouldn't understand the whole story even if I explained it to you. But don't worry, the patch will come with hidden lore, new abilities, a variety of experiences, etc. Get ready, this is going to be big. Bu the way. The Developer's wife has been conducting a survey. I swear they don't want you to buy anything, just do whatever the hell you want and respect one another, and don't fking troll. It gets annoying.",
    "I purchased Nordick track x32i, almost a 4K Machine, with $199 Shipping costs. The shipping team insisted they have to place the treadmill in the garage, citing COVID reasons. We had to lift heavy equipment and assemble it ourselves even though we paid hefty price for shipping. The screen and everything turned on after we assembled it in our first floor, but the belt doesn't run no matter what speed is selected. I reached out to the customer service with in a week of delivery and they were not helpful at all. They pretended they did not understand which seems to be a common problem with the treadmill and try to find excuses not to address the faulty machine. They went to extent of making me send pics of where the machine was set up claiming they won't cover it if its still in the garage, to begin with they insisted to place it there. Fortunately we had no room in the garage and we had to set up in our recreation room. I sent the pictures with a fraction of second and they disappeared on me. What kind of service is this? They start conversation with anything they can do to escape servicing you. Dont' they run tests on machines that are being delivered? Anyone with terrible experience as me?",
    "Hello folks - I am 43 with an MBA and am a Program Manager. I make a very good income but would like to slowly get to a point where I could pursue early retirement at 50. My definition of early retirement is to have flexibility in pursuing my interests. I am open to choosing a second career where I have this flexibility. I have an undergraduate degree in Engineering. I love building things. As examples I installed recessed lighting in my home, built my own theater in my home, build a backyard playset for my kids. I am wondering if pursuing something like HVAC technician or electrician or plumbing on the side can help proper a second career. Can someone advise what are meaningful second career opportunities to pursue?",

If they make the alberto slower than that thing they're moronic to the highest degree and if they make magy stronger than it should be and faster than it should be they're also moronic as that would be conceptually ridiculous, I said the devs should've had the foresight to see magys biggest problems but with a name like Afterthoughts I take that back as they're really living up to that name, fact is it should've been replace by Amargasaurus or Shunosaurus.",
    "Apologizes for all my recent posts to this sub lately. Found out today that I failed AUD with a 71. On test day I woke up feeling extremely foggy and mentally unfocused, and I feel like this is a large reason why I failed. The testing centers near me have openings next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, so I’m heavily contemplating retaking the exam next week. Would studying full time between now and next Wednesday/Thursday be enough for a pass? Not sure if I should put my all into studying for the next 6-7 days and try to schedule a retake next week, or if I should take my time and schedule it for a few weeks out. I feel like all of the information is still very fresh in my mind, which is why I kind of have this need to take it immediately. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "I’ve had unexplained severe abdominal pains that have landed me in emergency 3 times. They are so bad so chronic and severe that I’ve ended up on oxycodone and pregabalin for pain. I know it sounds crazy but in the search for answers I discovered a slipped disc and got the neurosurgeon to prescribe me dihydrocodeine as I’d previously used codeine paracetamol I had lying in the house from another family member. I’m doing a stool test with a naturopath on Monday that tests for everything including SIBO SIFO And H.Pylori . My question is has anyone had abdominal pains that are cruel and torture me to death. With the continuing feeling that I have a fart or BM to pass, have had this feeling 24/7 for 8 months and it’s torturing. Even the pain killers don’t help as much anymore.",
    "We call ourselves the generation of change, but I feel like we are a scam. We are meant to be the generation which shows the others how to be respectable people, but how the hell are we meant to be the “superior” generation if you are making fun over a recently deceased man? Prince Phillip created the wwf for gods sake, which last I checked is a charity trying to prevent animals becoming extinct. He was a man who fought for change in the past which shaped our present, and frankly without him, we wouldn’t be where we are today. I know he isn’t perfect, by any means, and it is inevitable somebody will comment about how he was, but 10 minutes after it was announced he died, a tonne of memes came out. I’m ashamed over how fast the memes are, and the fact that people are there saying “thank god he is dead” clearly have no respect. Most of the memes I’ve seen are from gen z, and it makes me ashamed to be a part of this generation.",

I called him hitler, and he replied with “hitler was a republican, I am a democrat is side with the left”. Hitler. Republican. Excuse me? But it doesn’t end there, ladies and gentlemen, I respond with “hitler was a nazi”. He says that anyone who apposes the left is a nazi so that makes him the same as a republican. I said that not everyone who apposes him is a nazi, and he replied with “that’s why we need to imprison everyone who disagrees with the left first because they are the violent ones who want to kill us.” What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People? Better watch out, this guy is gonna run for president and imprison every “nazi” so that it is only pure people with his beliefs. And it’s not only the fact that he was calling everyone a nazi, it was the fact that the dude was saying he was gonna do exactly why hitler did.

    "Hi, I am a female in college and the last relationship that I was in he constantly struggled to stay hard during sex. He said it was because he was always nervous around me or had been drinking too much and I believed him then, but now I have hooked up with quite a few people since then and more than half of them have also had this problem with me. They either cannot finish at all or I have to give them a BJ for them to stay erect. Is there something I could consistently be doing wrong? I always ask when this happens if there's something they want me to do differently, but I am always reassured that it isn't me, but its happened too many time for me to believe that now haha. Is this problem more common than I thought with guys in their early 20's? Or is there something girls do during sex that would cause this to happen that I could possibly be doing?",

    "So it takes a good 30 minutes or so to get a decent base up and supply it with resources, it takes a bastion 1 minute to fly over it and destroy it in a quick drive by shooting. Whats the point anymore? Add in the rapidly rotating continents where alerts are triggered within the first 30 minutes of a continent opening these days, putting effort into creating a nice base feels like a total wasted effort. The whole system could be so much better with some changes. Some sort of system that adds persistence to bases after continent lock would be nice for example, the game really could use some form of persistence like that, as it stands now its just a never ending cycle of continent locks and alerts with no real long term meaning. The durability of bases could really use some balance changes as well, its just too ridiculously easy to destroy them compared to the time investment required to set a nice one up.",

I drive the speed limit at all times no matter what because I'm neurotic and cannot afford to get pulled over and have my car insurance increase. So obviously people pass me constantly. Almost every car that ends up behind me. I'm not stupid so I've inferred that people don't drive the speed limit so I should be at traffics speed, and I must be annoying. Sorry to anyone that I've inconvenienced. I just don't understand the point of having posted speed limits that no one follows yet you can still legally get pulled over and ticketed for not following them. I'm genuinely confused if this is an unspoken rule that everyone understands and I'm just not in the loop. Why do we need to go so fast anyway? What's the rush guys???",

That's why I thought that I could take AP stats over the summer of Junior year at Johns Hopkins CTY to give me one more course. However, I realized that I'm also gonna be pretty busy this year with writing my essays and retaking my SAT, but at the same time, another AP might help, I don't know for sure.

    "Available for the first time on vinyl is the complete OLYMPIA THEATRE, PARIS, FRANCE 5/3/72 show from the Grateful Dead’s legendary Europe ‘72 Tour. Of the twenty-two performances on the famed Europe '72 tour, the first night in Paris on 5/3/72 has always been considered one of the best. This is proven by the fact that four songs from this concert were included on the seventeen-track, seminal platinum-selling Europe '72 album. The performance also includes five songs sung by Pigpen on what would be his final tour, including a massive “Good Lovin',” which allows Pigpen to do what he does best: hold the audience in the palm of his hand while they hang on his every word.

Seriously. I am currently all in on AMC, but just today I was thinking of buying some GME. I truly believe and have seen exceptional DD that GME is gonna run up really fucking high. I think that big price jump in January was  not the actual squeeze but an artificially inflated price to get people to sell. And it worked. Just my opinion. Not financial advice. You can’t go wrong either way. Just read a bit more because GME may just be further along than AMC and very well could pull the truly big numbers sooner.",

I tend to work 2-3 months at a time and take a month or two to live off my savings and unemployment before going back to work to re up on money.

Now it doesn't really bother me if they have a handful of clothes that's fine, but if they just toss a whole pile of clothes and don't sort them or anything, it just gets on my nerves. Do they not realize how long it's gonna take to remove like 30 fucking hangers, and that it's literally holding up EVERYONE ELSE in line???? What makes it worse is that people usually put their clothes up last, so as I'm scanning everything else, they have time to at least take SOME hangers off instead of just dropping a big pile on me. Shout-outs to the customers who actually remove the hangers beforehand or before I start scanning them, it genuinely saves me so much time",

It would be fun to see the convoy stop at monuments and have a squad of scientist disembark as well as one manning the 50 on the M-ATV and having players assault it. Even cooler would be the ability to ambush the convoy with HV rockets and land mines to get a one up on the Scientist. It would be interesting to see what new gameplay this would create as you would have an event constantly roaming around the map unlike the Bradley at Launch every encounter with this convoy will be different",
    "As i watched the show, i began to notice something very unique that this show has that not too many other do. It has amazing writing and character development. I just LIVE how it isnt focused on a single main character, the show tends to branch out and give each character at least 1 amazing and impactful story of their own. Admittedly, the first season was mainly centered around Q, but the rest of the seasons were perfectly and beautifully spread out between the characters, allowing for amazing development and backstory growth for each one. And not only do they give each character their own amazing story, but they blend them all in together soooo well. For the writing, i just gotta say one thing: Margo. I cant tell you how many times i laughed at some of the things she has said. This show is a perfect example of how shows should be.

    "Hi guys and gals. I was doing my morning meditation and at the end of it a thought popped into my head \"why did it take me so long to quit kratom despite the nightmare i was living in daily?\". I used for 2 years everyday, 10-30gpd...sometimes more. I came to the conclusion that i was so use to feeling like absolute shit after taking kratom that i became subconsciously attached to that world because it was all i knew. If you're \"afraid\" to quit...don't be. Why? Because kratom already makes you feel like absolute shit....otherwise you wouldn't be on this sub wanting to quit. Will the withdrawals and paws be worse than how you feel now? It's a matter of how you perceive it. Here's the thing...you know exactly what taking kratom leads you to....more and more and more....it's never enough. Like a monster that needs to be constantly fed. All the while you still feel like shit. Here's the thing that quitting it leads you to....getting your life back, feeling emotions besides fear and anxiety again, your physical and mental health returning, your joy, compassion, gratitude, and happiness. Is everything perfect and peachy after you quit....of course not. But the days you are feeling like shit, you can step back and know at least the next hour, week, month, or year could be different than how you feel after ingesting that green sludge. How bad do you want your life back? Is it worth a few weeks of feeling like shit compared to years? You know the answer. You're not alone. Stay strong...and if you need to reach out REACH OUT. I'll do anything i can to help",
    "Hi. I want help if anyone can spare a few words of encouragement. I wrote religious on the topic of this because I am kind of a religious. I grew up catholic and I don’t follow the church a lot but I do have faith. I’ve posted her before about how my dad treats me. I’m the oldest daughter and I feel like my mom and I are used as the scapegoat to why everything is horrible for my dad. Anyway, I feel alone a lot. I pray and I feel like no one is listening. Does anyone have some scripture or words of encouragement from the Bible? I sometimes feel like I am the one in the wrong because my dad uses God and my faith against me. Anything would be great. I am going to get a keepsake with the Virgin Mary on it to keep me safe and to remind myself she is there with me. Anyway, thank you to this group. It makes me feel less alone.",
    "Have these positions been eliminated in all Lowe's stores? I was hired as a Pro Electrical associate that included a higher quarterly bonus structure than regular floor associates get. I was informed at the end of last year that the Pro-Electrical and Pro- Plumbing positions have been eliminated and that my bonus would be reduced by quite a bit. This is a demotion that I did nothing to deserve. It is a reduction in my yearly compensation for the work I do. In the meantime, I am still doing all of the things for Pro Services that I had previously done, so the only difference in my work requirements is that I no longer have access to some of the abilities to control stock inventory as I used to. Just wondering if this was a store management decision or a corporate one.",
    "Can we all as a collective agree that huge maps ~~are bad~~ with only 1 area of interest are bad. The way their design is lacking. With only 1 point of interest if you don't get the good spawns for them then you your shit out off luck. Have fun clearing resort with gigga chads camping dark corners, and the infamous potted rats and don't get me started on woods oh god woods. If shoreline ever gets a face lift like customs just add more then just 1 area of interest and have future maps have more focus on form over function. Maybe add beach houses and touristy spots or maybe since we have a power station why not pair it with a water treatment plant with offices, a parking lot, and big silos. I'm not a game designer but this ain't it.",
    "We were talking about someone who was using substance abuse and I was shattered due to it and lost a night of sleep and was about to go into depression for a week. My therapist just calmly asked how my weekend was as usual, and I told it was not that great and he asked if I wanted to talk about it.. I just kept quiet and uttered, why don't you ask.. he closed everything and just quietly asked \"What happened that made you feel this way?\" And I instantly opened up and told it hurt me and I know it shouldn't have because my life is more important and I was learning in therapy how to become a better person. He just asked \"Are you sad about it?\" And I replied..\"not sad, disappointed, I don't want people to go down a bad path and others don't even understand it's not okay and support it and I always be the odd one out\". He just replied saying \"shouldn't\" is a strong word you used, it's fine to feel that way, you should take your time. He was like \"Trust me, you're just 21 now, by the time you're 27, you'll be the one who will have her life under control whereas they'd not and I that's because you understand well\". He also told me I don't fit it or isolate myself because I understand people too well and people mostly don't like it. I just perked up and told, \"So what? I love being this way\" and he was like yeah, that's important. The fact that we both understand each other so well makes me so happy that I can just sit and talk to him and forget that he's my therapist and just someone who I am comfortable with.",
    "We've all seen it time and time again.  Someone goes through a life saving medical procedure, or is rescued by brave EMS from harrowing situations, and their reaction once they recover is to thank God for working his magic and saving their life.  Advancements in medicine that helps struggling third world countries is \"God's work\".  He uses the hands of doctors and scientists to provide for his flock.  But now, in 2021, while going through the worst global pandemic in a hundred years, a vaccine comes out and Christians everywhere are fighting tooth and nail to demonize it.  What happened to \"God works in mysterious ways\"?  Sorry if this has been said a million times on this sub already, but I've recently been pleading with some family members to get vaccinated, and while they aren't specifically citing their religion for the reason behind it, it definitely seems to be stemming from their church.  Why are they now abandoning their blanket attributions of science to God.  We all know why, it's just crazy to me that they so easily forget their own logic.",
    "Let me start by saying I like oppressors. They’re fun, fun to use and to fight against.  I played this game when it came out, and took a hiatus for a few years, came back on ps4 in 2017 and there was a bunch of new stuff I didn’t care to grind up at the time.. I’ve been playing again for a few months and am working towards having all the shiny toys, my newest one being a khanjali I fully upgraded thinking it would be a decent swatter for the oppressors in an open lobby.. the aiming radius sucks and less than ten rockets kills the damn thing, I’m a little bummed out but not too discouraged. On foot I usually goad those guys into tight covered spaces and headshot them. Just wondering if any of you fine folks have any ground fighting tactics against oppressors you want to share",
    "Currently stuck on the glass bead milestone hard, from what I understand you need to find around 8 submerged ruins before you get given the horrific treasure. On my last play session I managed to get like 5 submerged ruins back to back via scanning with the nautilon but now for the past 10-15 oceans, on over 10 planets I havent been able to find a single one. Just an unlucky 3 hour dry streak? Or is there something im not getting. Because from what ive seen, the scanner radius is huge, some of the ruins it found for me were over 8 minutes of travel time away and im finding it hard to believe im simply not in range to locate any. Extremely frustrating as its one of the last milestones I need and I cant really find any information on it, or submerged ruins at all on youtube or the wiki, and my only option is just a crapshoot at landing on a random planets ocean, constructing a nautilon bay, scanning, finding absolutely nothing, rinse and repeat.",
    "We married young. Had a baby young. Both needed to do some major growing up. Played the back and forth game for years. Finally decided enough was enough. He left mine and our daughters lives. I have always said he's my soul mate. No doubt about it. But he had a drinking problem and needed to grow up. After years of looking for qualities he had in other men. I finally gave up and settled for a man who seemed to love me and my daughter We got pregnant less than 6 months into our relationship. We kept trying and eventually got married. My oldest wanted the same last name and asked to be adopted. My ex-husband agreed to do what he thought his daughter wanted. Current husband turned out to be a liar and master manipulator. Good dad but bad for me. I started seeing a therapist and realized I never have let go of my ex-husband and all the things I wanted to say she said I needed to talk to him or write him a letter. So I did. We talked and we talked and we talked. We both realized we have never been truly happy since we split. He's finally grown up and regrets his mistakes but can't do anything to change them. He only wants to make up for them. So we are here. I'm separated from my current husband and so completely in love with my ex-husband that it's unreal how right it feels.",
    "I played three games of Control tonight. The first match was a neck and neck struggle. It was difficult, but my team pulled ahead and won. Afterwards, teams were broken up and made more “fair”. My next two games were up against a sweaty 4 stack that fucked us and mercy ruled us 97-33. However teams were not changed and I was stuck against the same 4 stack the next round, despite the matchup being anything but fair. How the hell does this happen? Lately almost every game I have played has been much more unbalanced, but when it is a fair game that doesn’t end with Shaxx pitying us, the matchmaking says “Fuck you” before throwing me into a awful sweat fest that make me regret even picking up the controller.",
    "I have to reread a book I hated . I read this book maybe 5 years ago and I don't remember the plot much but I do remember the main character's father and one of her sisters. The father is some noble guy who can't marry the Mc's mother because she is a lower class ,so instead he never married her or found a solution and just became husband and wife in everything but name. He is a general / commander and when his friend/ leader died  they do this tradition where they cannot eat or drink anything but bread or water for a week I think. He forces his pregnant \"wife\" to do this tradition even though the tradition usually allows  pregnant people to  skip it.  Her youngest  sister has a club foot too.  Something happens in the book where ,he decides to leave his family to officially marry someone else and this is a character defining moment for the MC since her father is a dick.",
    "I got a monstera clipping from a friend, potted it and put it next to my sliding glass door that got several hours of bright sunlight. I had it there for about a year and not much happened. It grew 1 or 2 new leaves that stayed really small. I moved it outside where it got about 3 or 4 hours of direct sun a day. It grew super fast and got really big. I recently moved to a new place where there’s no room for it inside so I kept it outside. However now it gets direct sunlight almost all day. Everything I read about monsteras is that they will burn in direct sun, so I’m worried about summer coming and having almost no shade. Does anyone else have a monstera that loves direct sun? Or am I about to kill my plant?",

    "Our friend accidentally caught an adult Banded Water Snake while fishing, and the poor snake got injured by the fish hook. We removed the hook from the snake’s side, and I handled the snake to make sure he was okay and calm. We did not have any iodine or the proper equipment to treat his wound, but thankfully the hook didn’t puncture any vital organs. I put him around my neck and shoulders while carrying him back down to the lake, and my friend took a photo of me with the snake around my neck, and then posted it on Facebook before we let the snake go. The comments on the Facebook post were ignorant and ridiculous. People were saying “he has a death wish. That’s a water moccasin.” Or “it looks fully evil”. First off, it was NOT a water moccasin. The snake had round pupils and was not aggressive, and I’m experienced enough to know what snake is what. I definitely would not free handle a venomous snake. Some people are idiots and should really get educated before trying to put their two cents in. The snake was completely harmless. I wanted to treat his wounds before letting him go back into the wild, but he swam away just fine.",

    "I came up with some good chorus lyrics for a song I want to write but my brain immediately created some stupid melody for them that isn't even good and now I can't break out of it. Every time I try and write some lyrics  my brain's goal is to conform to this rhythm and it's blocking me from being able to express myself. I found a better melody but that didn't help because now I can't break out of THAT one. I just want to write some words and THEN come up with the melody, but because I'm stuck in this one, I can't come up with any words. I tried writing it down as a poem instead of a song but still I just can't stop that melody and rhythm circling in my head. I tried playing some other melody and writing to that but that didn't work either. Any ideas? Lol",
    "Obviously Attila predates our modern understanding of \"conservative\" or \"right wing\" by thousands of years, but I'm still quite confused. As you may recall, last year, Kelly Loeffler ran a campaign ad in which she claimed to be \"more conservative then Attila the Hun.\" This confused me, as I'd never heard anything about Attila being particularly conservative; I also just read a Donald Trump quote from the 2000 election cycle, in which he said, \"I'm on the conservative side, but Buchanan is Attila the Hun.\" Hearing two comparisons of conservatives to Attila the Hun has just left me confused, so I came here to ask anyone who can answer: was Attila the Hun especially conservative? Enough so to warrant these hyperbolic comparisons?",

Apparently it's better to pot them in those biodegradable pots and leave them indoors until they grow about 6 inches then replant them. My problem with this is that I can't do it in my house and have to do it in a treehouse instead, there's a fair amount of light but not as much as a house window due to the tree cover, it has insulation and double glazed windows but the temperature still drops overnight.

    "My Xbox One S has been sent back to Microsoft in the past and was \"fixed\" but now the problems are even worse. Games flat out won't start, so pretty much every time I want to play a game I have to hard reset the console and wait to see if that worked, which it usually doesn't. If it does work then only a certain few games work and only if the console wants to let me play that day. It's totally random when the console wants to work so it usually just doesn't. If a game will even load it will eventually boot me back to the home screen and show an error message saying \"for some reason your game took too long to load\" and then I'll restart the process. Microsoft won't do anything other than suggest I try to send it in for repair which costs about $175 or just buy a new one since it's no longer under warranty.  I have literally tried every troubleshooting piece of advice Microsoft will give since I've called about 10 times. Thinking this may be internal hardware issue maybe?

    "So I’ve been pretty excited with all the Disney Villainous expansions that we have gotten and will get but I’m kinda curious if Ravensburger have future plans on doing Pixar Villainous. Since Disney owns Pixar I was thinking it would be really cool to see they’re take on how the Pixar Villains will win. Obviously I feel there’s a few Villains for I think would be really amazing to see. For example, Mister Waternoose from Monsters Inc. His goal could be literally be to scare Boo enough times to fill up a certain number of canisters with her screams, as well as having ally cards be Randal and other scare monsters from the floor. Also it would be cool to give Hopper from Bug’s Life a chance to throw down. As we known he’s main goal is to make the worker ants bring him enough food to survive the winter. It would be pretty cool to see how the circus troop play out against him in the game. Another villain that would be interesting to see from Pixar universe is AUTO from WALL-E. I love WALL-E and and nothing would scream crazy villain like an ai computer forcing the main kind to be lazy and to give up on returning back to earth. AUTO goal could be to obtain the plant and try to destroy it. Ideally there are many villains that could appear if they ever did a Pixar edition to of Disney Villainous, but will we ever see it come to fruition? Who would you think would be interesting to see from the Pixar world entering into the Villainous board game world?",

Then once I go to clean I am locked in focus, because if someone distracts me with a different task, like if my mom asks me to vacuum out the car while I’m getting ready to clean, I’ll have to vacuum at the car, then take another 15, 30 minutes scrolling through social media or something to re-excite myself and re-energize my brain before I go clean.

When she went for her second shot she was told her name wasn't in the system, but she had her vaccine card from her first appointment and they said they'll manually enter her second and all should be fine. Now when she searches the system on the app for proof of being vaccinated, it comes up empty. She has her paper vaccine card but she loses things easily and it would be best to have the pass on her phone. Anyone else have an issue with retrieving their pass? Or know of a solution?

    "I have to say, I haven’t ever gotten into reading quite like this, this series comes pretty close to my favorite book series Ready Player One, and might even overtake it. I just have never read a series with so much action in little romance, yet still incredibly wholesome. The last few months spent on the light novel have been absolutely amazing, and I’m so glad I decided to read past the current point in the manhwa. The side stories and after stories topped the story off perfectly, even though it left me feeling a little empty and lonely, those stories really enhance the main series and these stories wouldn’t be as good if the original story wasn’t so amazing. The author could really be criticized for the ending, but for me it made me feel so happy, even though I didn’t feel as fulfilled as I wanted to be. I just have to say, this light novel and even the art for the manhwa is just breathtaking. Absolutely breathtaking.",
    "I entered a casual relationship with a married couple. It was perfect I always wanted to hook up with a milf and the husband never minded I never bottomed or gave head. Eventually, they'd asked me to officially join their relationship. I was against it as they were old enough to be my parents, I'd have no security in the relationship, and the idea of committing to more than one person skeeves me out. I told them it was best to keep things casual. I'd later meet my girlfriend so I broke up with them. Things almost immediately went to shit. They both started harassing me. I got to the point where I had to inform my GF which meant I had to come out to her. I never intended on doing so since I would effectively be straight in our relationship. I was also scared she would see me as less attractive. Thankfully she didn't care and was supportive through the ordeal. I managed to finally get the couple the stop harassing me by threatening to post some videos we made online. Things will work in the end but I hate that I was essentially forced to out myself before I was comfortable",

If I hurt someone it has to be for a reason, and it just hurts me because the way she looks at me, it just doesn't feel right, that she looks at me as a violent person, especially when you sprinkle on the fact that I am a Male and we're muslims, so you can imagine what she thinks a man will do just because he's a man, and after all that, either no one takes me seriously or they never side with me or help me at least, just makes me feel worthless",
    "So I was terminated shortly after lockdowns last year after only ever recieving one write up a month and a half before. And this was in a year and a half long term with an employer. But business declined sharply and then after a couple of weeks with everyone getting their hours cut, I was terminated citing that I had violated the rulebook by smoking. In the block for unemployment that the employee provided the department of labor, there are 3 falsified write ups that I never saw or signed. One even has white out on it where they redacted something. I had been injured. In a neglect incident a few months before and was due two pay raises that had been promised. So my impression is that I was gotten rid of to cut labor expenses. But it was during a pandemic recession and I basically was reduced to homelessness. So I appealed.

Have a kid at home while having to be in the hospital for an extended stay? Have baby at 34 weeks/ a NICU stay? I am lost and could just use some advice/ experience/ or anything else.",
    "I'm interested in reading some of the worst you may've come across, whatever culture you're from and whichever nationality the pundit was. Like, there are the obvious ones like I once heard a Japanese commentator say \"David Pocockuuuu\" but I mean they're quite far away and all, but one of the worst I've heard might be a French commentator on Bein Sports pronouncing it \"Courtney LOVES\". No issue whatsoever with having an accent, no problem at all there, but when you're effectively transforming a name by reading it just the way your brain would spontaneously process it as a foreigner without getting a few basics in or checking with anyone beforehand, I find that amazing how lazy and unprofessional that is. For the entire match: \"Courtney Loves\".",
    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize. Great action scenes, big issue that touches past Bond and M which little is known. Sam Mendes does a masterful job directing this installment of James Bond. Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",
    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life. The animation looks great, the humor is on point of course, and the characters with so much more development. With some great moments is a fun sequel to all ages!",
    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for \"Airplane\", \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", and the \"Naked Gun\" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the \"Hotel Gay Schluffen\", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If \"Top Secret!\" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means \"She whose bosoms defy gravity\"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, \"Top Secret!\" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie.

It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither.

    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea.",
    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :<br/><br/><ul><li>Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole \"let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead\" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be \"safe\"? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!</li></ul><br/><br/>The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!<br/><br/>While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!<br/><br/>Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).<br/><br/>The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* \"twist\" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.<br/><br/>Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.<br/><br/>A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",
    "While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",
    "June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as \"Warriors of the Wind\" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible \"Princess Mononoke\" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer \"Nausicaa\". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort.",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (\"the Bear\") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of \"Glory Road\" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the \"Pit\". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about \"the Bear\" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as \"the Bear\". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book \"Glory Road\" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by \"the Bear\", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book \"Slam Dunk to Glory\". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.<br/><br/>I'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.<br/><br/>VALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",
    "That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful.

    "Terminator Salvation gets panned left and right.....but let me first say this is way more better then T3 and Genisys by miles.<br/><br/>Not only is it a serious terminator movie.....its more faithful to the first 2, yes it has plot holes and not die hard terminator violence but what do you expect when companies are trying to make everything PG13 for money.<br/><br/>This is the Terminator movie you get, to throwbacks to Guns n Rose you could be mine to a CGI arnie wreaking havoc, yes it could of been done better but some of it is actually really good, just accept and stop expecting the greatness of T2, that was cameron and this is MCG two different directors.<br/><br/>The acting is good, don't know what everyone is going on about with Bale being a weak connor when he is perfect for the role, yelchin plays a fantastic kyle reese and sam worthington is great as marcus.<br/><br/>Relax, watch and enjoy a good summer action movie with no expectations, the opening helicopter scene is a work of art.<br/><br/>TS - 7/10",
    "Once Jake Gyllenhaal signed on to do Nightcrawler I knew it would be a special film. The man has been producing nothing but gold lately and this is no different. Nightcrawler is an experience - it takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of seemingly charming slimeball reporter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). <br/><br/>Nightcrawler works on so many levels. The writing and direction is fantastic, which is especially impressive as it's the directorial debut by Dan Gilroy who takes on both duties. He had a clear vision of how he wanted to portray LA and the sleek, brooding yet slightly lackadaisical tone transfers perfectly onto the big screen. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance that's the polar opposite from his character in Prisoners and he was on point for every second. He was the perfect casting choice to carry the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a clear message on the media and how they abuse stories and reap the benefits regardless of who gets victimized. It's a message that has been told a million times before, but never quite like this. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou, who starts freelancing as a videographer of crime scenes and selling his footage to a news channel for money. We go along this journey with Lou and watch his transformation from being a sleazy but ambitious individual to becoming a manipulative, self-serving sociopath. Then you start to realize that he was like that all along. His charming charisma masked his true intentions, and this peek into his psyche is the most potent and disturbing aspect of the movie. It's a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle, and told with enough elegance and wit to keep you on board the whole way.<br/><br/>There's a dark comedic tone present throughout. Lou's persistence and crass remarks to basically anyone he encounters provide some good laughs. He doesn't sugarcoat anything, he'll talk to anyone in order to get his way, and he has a sleazy smirk that never fails to get a reaction. Also Gyllenhaal's chemistry with Rene Russo (the news director) is palatable and their work dynamic becomes more of a gripping co-dependency as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Nightcrawler is a must-watch for fans of cinema. It's a work of art from a directorial and writing standpoint, from an acting standpoint, and from a basic human nature standpoint. It really does a hell of a job at sucking you into this dark gloomy world to the point where you don't want to get out. It's intense, it's funny, it's thrilling, it's powerful, and most of all, it's real. Nightcrawler is simply sensational.",
    "Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'. <br/><br/>The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events. <br/><br/>In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.<br/><br/>One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.<br/><br/>Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games). <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work. <br/><br/>These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.<br/><br/>Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.<br/><br/>What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children. <br/><br/>Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain.",
    "It was made to be silly. There's nothing in this movie that's meant to offend anyone. It's a silly, fun-loving, harmless movie. I enjoyed it when I was 8 and I still do now at 18. Anyone who takes this movie seriously, needs to relax, have fun, enjoy the goofiness. This movie is one you can enjoy with your friends, family and young children DON'T have to be sent out of the room for inappropriate action.<br/><br/>It's silly, remember that. It's supposed to make you laugh!<br/><br/>All the girls are young, and the band still together. A few years later, everything fell apart for them. Enjoy the youth and laughter while you can.",
    "Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br/><br/>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br/><br/>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br/><br/>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br/><br/>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br/><br/>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br/><br/>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are great again<br/><br/>Charm returns<br/><br/>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Only one movie with Baby Groot? Noooo!<br/><br/>They seem to have dropped Drax's taking everything literal jokes away<br/><br/>Michael Rosenbaum was wasted<br/><br/>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br/><br/>Batista should have skipped over wrestling and just been an actor",
    "Having watched the film (more than once)i must say that i think that the person who wrote the comment \"A Stupid and Extremely Disappointing Movie\" is being silghtly childish. You cannot watch a film like Van Helsing with out taking it with a pinch of salt - it is a movie with vampires, werewolves and the frankenstine monster in at all at once for goodness sake. So you cannot go in to it thinking in a literal sense. You have to accept that it is not going to be some ground breaking epic and that it is just a bit of fun - but at the end of the day that doesn't matter, because if you go in with the right attitude and you enjoy it, then what does it matter that it is a bit \"off\" in places. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to any one who likes action/fantasy films and is up for a bit of fun!",
    "Ever wondered what it would be like to see Tom Cruise taking a break from his usual Sci-Fi & Impossible series \"avatar\". Well, here is your answer - It gets even more exciting and entertaining. This is Tom Cruise's real life take on the impossible series where Barry Seal replaces Ethan Hunt and CIA as the agency, which dictates the terms. It's just that Barry loves to go with the flow and without any intention of getting involved with anything that seems out of his league and this is something each one of us can relate to. He is your usual guy who happens to be a pilot and wants to make some extra cash with every extra mile. So what's wrong with it? Well nothing is wrong when you do it for the right guys, and nothing gets more exciting and dangerous when those right guys turn out to be CIA.<br/><br/>What is even more amusing and entertaining to watch is the fact that despite having no choice left but to cooperate with CIA, \"Barry Seal never says no\" to any offer (even if it comes from any drug lord) that helps him maintain his cash flow that obviously was becoming unmanageable for him by every passing day. Although, I must admit that it was quite a fun to watch him trying to manage millions of cash that he had no idea how to spend. <br/><br/>You will definitely enjoy watching Tom cruise as Barry Seal who uses CIA to get his end of the bargain (and they thought that they were the only smart guys who live in one of the greatest countries of the world).<br/><br/>If you want to go on an adventure trip, go watch this movie and you will understand what Tom Cruise really means when he says, \"I am just a gringo who always delivers\".",
    "Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982's Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.<br/><br/>The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. <br/><br/>The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.<br/><br/>The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.<br/><br/>\nThe Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph.",
    "The greatest fault of The Thin Red Line was its timing - it was released at around the same time as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.  While most people dismissed The Thin Red Line as the `other' World War II movie of 1998, it's actually a very different kind of film - the film itself is not hurt by similarity to Ryan but was hurt commercially due to the misconception. It's easy to forget that Red was nominated for seven Oscars.  This is an extraordinary film that can stand well on its own next to Ryan.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan was significant in that it visually depicted war in a realistic, gritty way.  The Thin Red Line's focus is more philosophical. It is about the contradiction between the beauty of nature and the destructive nature of men.  The movie cuts continuously between the external struggle of American GIs fighting to take a crucial hill from Japanese occupation on Guadalcanal - and more importantly, the internal chaos of war as every man tries to come to his own terms about matters such as morals, death, God, and love.<br/><br/>Unlike in Saving Private Ryan, there is nothing patriotic about this movie. In fact, there probably has never been a more anti-war film.  The fighting men here are disillusioned, lost, and frightened.  They don't fight for their country or \"democracy\" - they fight because they have to.  The only priorities are survival, and - for the more humane - caring for their comrades.  Renowned composer Hans Zimmer - who won an Oscar nomination for his work-captures the grim mood perfectly and allows us to hear the men's thoughts.<br/><br/>The characters are portrayed by a strong ensemble cast.  Acting is uniformly excellent, especially Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall, who is the unfeeling commander of the ground offensive on Guadalcanal. Thoroughly unlikable, he is the closest thing to a villain in the movie.  After studying war for an untold number of years, Tall sees Guadalcanal as his chance to prove himself and move up in the ranks - the men are only a tool to accomplish this goal and expendable.  In one crucial scene, he orders a captain (played by Elias Koteas, in another outstanding role) to lead his men to a frontal assault against a Japanese controlled hill.  When the captain suggests a more logical alternative, the colonel screams: \"You are not gonna take your men around in the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!\"  To this, the captain replies, `I've lived with these men, sir, for two and a half years and I will not order them all to their deaths.'  Later, when the hill is taken, he is dismissed of his duties as Tall sees him as a threat to the successful achievement of his goal.  Certainly, not every commander must have been that coldhearted and selfish, but surely some were, though not necessarily to that extreme.<br/><br/>While the acting is very good, much of the cast is relatively unknown and it can initially be hard to distinguish the characters from each other as they may appear to be very similar.  They are all about the same age, have dirt smeared over their faces, and wear helmets and the same military garb. Also, the stars in this movie have very small roles.  George Clooney and John Travolta are credited with starring roles while really little more than extras - clearly for marketing purposes.  You will not see more than two minutes of each.<br/><br/>One of the main themes of the movie is the contrast between nature and men's destructiveness in war.  The director, Terrence Malick, hired cinematographer John Toll to capture this on camera, and towards achieving that goal they couldn't have been more successful.  The almost surreal scenery is nothing short of stunning and has the same visual impact as any special effect.  The beauty of nature is always present, even when it is a setting for battle of destruction, and death.<br/><br/>Though the battle scenes fall short of the frightening realism in Saving Private Ryan, they are heads and soldiers above every previous attempt. One truly gets the sense that war is a chaotic, often hopeless environment where it is only a matter of luck whether you survive or get killed.<br/><br/>\n`How did we lose the good that was given us? Or let it slip away? Scatter it carelessly ... trade it for what has no worth?'  The film is filled with such poetic questions as to which there are no real answers.  This is definitely not a party movie.  There isn't anything uplifting about it - it is downright depressing.  Asides from entertainment value, however, this is a film that makes you think.",
    "Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised \" Esther's secret\" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the \"secret\" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a \"creepy\" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",
    "A Gen Z update to Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 cult classic, this remake is essentially an episode of Fast and Furious in which the vehicular exploits have been replaced with an assortment of extreme sports sequences. Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like \"the only law is gravity\" and \"everyone dies, it's just a matter of how\", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences, yet they're not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller.",
    "I went into this movie confident that it would be a cheesy, campy romp with the same \"tried and true tricks of the trade,\" like when the hero is investigating the creepy music coming from the basement and a cat jumps into frame, but I quickly discovered that this would not be case with Insidious. After watching the move and obsessing on it for about 12 hours now, I can honestly say it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. In fact, there were several points during the film where I screamed like a 13-year old girl at a Justin Beiber concert. Keep in mind I was consciously trying my hardest to keep my composure, mainly because I was sitting beside my new girlfriend of 2 months. She, incidentally, didn't make a peep; thankfully, I later found out she had her eyes closed the whole time. <br/><br/>I was also expecting to see some blood and guts, especially coming from the guys who made Saw, but there wasn't a drop. Instead, they used just about everything else in their arsenal to scare the bejesus out of me and everyone else in the theater (my girlfriend included). From literally the opening credits, they created an intense, haunting tension that didn't leave my body till several whiskeys and half a Xanax later. And the movie constantly feeds that tension, making even the characters' mundane family life somehow seem utterly terrifying. I was actually exhausted leaving the theater from all of the uncomfortable squirming I was unable to control. I'd say it's the most calories I've ever burned while watching a movie (well, at least a PG-13 movie). <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was great. It was crazy scary, thoroughly entertaining, and even surprisingly funny at times. Having said that, it will be quite some time before I watch another horror movie; I have no desire to be turned into a frazzled bundle of nerves again anytime soon. So, if you plan on seeing this movie, please consider this a cautionary reminder: it's probably best to go with someone who's already witnessed you have a complete physical and mental breakdown, so as to avoid an embarrassing drive home. And maybe bring a Xanax as well.",
    "People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. <br/><br/>What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.<br/><br/>Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. <br/><br/>Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.<br/><br/>Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.<br/><br/>You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",
    "It is a classic offbeat horror-melodrama merging harmoniously the family Gothic extravaganza, supernatural power, and a woman's movie of a peculiar kind It remains the cinema's best adaptation of a Stephen King novel <br/><br/>The film initiated De Palma's inclination for surprise diverts between playful imagination and reality, as in the opening, which swifts from a soft-core porn fantasia of girls taking a shower in the locker room to the fact of Carrie's menstruation for the first timethe first sign of \"otherness\" that will reserve her as an horrifying monster from her small-minded colleagues <br/><br/>All the oppression that Carrie undergoes both at home (with a bible beating maniacal mother played by scary Piper Laurie who develops twisted bizarre ideas) and at school to suppress tension which takes the shape of super telekinetic power, the ability to move objects with the strength of her mind We observe with ambivalence as Carrie's insatiable revenge jumps the line into uncontrolled mass murders ever filmed <br/><br/>Sissy Spacek is amazing as the mocked, helpless girl pushed over the edge Her face and body twist like a living special effect to unleash her pent up rage, as well as her character's alarming progress from painfully shy high-school teenager to Angel of Vengeance",
    "This movie is soooo gross! The eye scene? Puke rising up to my mouth just thinking about it! Blech!!! So much excessive horror nastiness! Sick as heck, but just hard not to watch! Throw in the gorgeous women, and you've got a disgustingly beautiful horror flick!<br/><br/>I loved the Oli character - the king of swing - \"Of course my horse\"! And the gang of young boys that want gum! So weird! I also liked the whole Europeaness of the film - the location, language, and overall feel of it! Lent a big piece of realism to it all.<br/><br/>My negative rant is that I wanted to know more about the town, and the people, and the \"why\" of it all. I know money is part/most of it. But I wanted to know why.",
    "Sacha Baron Cohen comes to America in the guise of Borat Sagdiyev and wreaks his own brand of Kazakhi havoc in this very very funny film.<br/><br/>In our age of uber-political correctness, \"Borat\" comes sweeping through like a brisk and refreshing wind, completely bounding over every cultural taboo we've erected around ourselves. Thus, no one is safe: Borat takes on Jews, blacks, gays, feminists, middle-Americans, religious fanatics, frat boys. The only weapon against the bumbling Borat is a sense of humour, which this movie shows most Americans painfully lack. Indeed, if there is any message to be had from \"Borat\" (and I'm not sure there is much of one, beyond its fascinating cultural experiments), it's that everyone needs to lighten up and not take themselves so seriously.<br/><br/>The image of Americans projected in this film varies from the heartwarming to the downright frightening. New Yorkers threaten Borat with physical violence when he approaches them on a subway. Feminists walk out on him when they find his views on women too much to tolerate. Folks out in the heartland commiserate with him over his hatred of gays and Jews; a gun shop owner even helps him pick out the best weapon for shooting Jewish people. A sweet Jewish couple give him a place to sleep, and bring him a homey meal (that is, before they turn into invading cockroaches). A group of manic Pentecosts help him find Jesus. An RV full of frat boys make complete asses of themselves by espousing their hopelessly ill-informed views on minorities in our country and the need to revert to slavery. The majority of people treat Borat in the condescending way of those who want to think of themselves as being culturally aware without really knowing anything at all about other cultures. These people become rude the second Borat offends their sense of propriety. On the other hand, the disenfranchised of America greet Borat with open arms, and we see a group of gays and a group of blacks interacting with him as if no cultural boundaries existed at all. The film's sweetest (and most unexpectedly so) moments come from Borat's befriending of a black prostitute.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a carefully crafted work of fiction, and Cohen only lets his audience see what he wants them to see. I would probably react much the same as many of the people in this film if this crazy-looking and sounding man appeared out of nowhere and began to antagonize me. But the movie does make Americans look like a bunch of awfully self-important, uptight stiffs, and I've been to enough places in this country and met enough people to realize that the way events play out in this film (even if they are manipulated or staged) probably come very close to the real thing.<br/><br/>Thank God for movies like \"Borat.\" If nothing else, they remind us that our cultural boundaries only matter as much as we let them, and that all of the fears that govern political correctness are mostly ungrounded. After all, virtually every person in this film was offended at one point or another, and as far as I can tell, all of them lived to tell about it.<br/><br/>Grade: A",
    "In bringing together elements from Inglourious Basterds, Ocean's Eleven and Museum Hours, George Clooney certainly had plenty of opportunity for a rich and interesting story. War heroes who appreciate fine art played by the likes of Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman (plus a few \"that guy\"s), attempting to steal back priceless works of art from the Nazis, it sounds amazing.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? Well, to begin with, for a movie about a team, we're given very little time with them as a group. Almost immediately they pair off on their own little adventures. Instead of using these exploits to let us know a little more about the characters as individuals, we get the usual oddball pairings and some mildly amusing, but ultimately hollow, vignettes. Even when we lose some of our team, it really feels like nothing more than just something that happened on the trip, like \"oh, and I also saw a horse.\" We have hardly any sense of them as a group and far less about them as people. The only character whose motivations we can understand is the one played by Cate Blanchett, but her limited chemistry with Matt Damon dooms what little redemptive quality her character had.<br/><br/>Also, and particularly troubling for a movie involving art, George Clooney's lens has little reverence for the work it shows. Though the film heavy-handedly ponders whether a piece of art is worth a human life, the camera never does. Even when a character lays down his life for a sculpture, it comes off less dramatic than inevitable. The film treats the works as being mostly historically significant and never finds that lover's gaze that tells the audience why.<br/><br/>What we're left with is a bag of spare parts. It's a popcorn movie with no setpieces. A war movie with no battles. A heist movie with no scheming. An art movie with no inspiration. Were they to have found some of Inglourious Basterds' bluster, Ocean's Eleven smarts or Museum Hour's insight, they may have found a formula that works, but that's not the movie we have here. I'll be damned if George Clooney doesn't look good in a moustache, though.",
    "There's a lot of anxiety that goes into viewing The Exorcist, \"the scariest movie ever made\", for the very first time. And with that anxiety comes a lot of expectations and preconceived ideas about what The Exorcist *should* be. Especially for someone born after the film. Then on top of that waited years before finally seeing it.<br/><br/>I love the Exorcist, and after exposure to God knows how many horror films, the Exorcist remains my favorite within the genre. And even from a die-hard fan I have to admit, I hate hearing \"scariest movie of all time\" associated with this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, there's no reason to compare fright factor of films, so forget that anyone ever called The Exorcist \"the scariest movie ever made.\" Take any movie  I don't care what movie  and stick a \"greatest/scariest/best\" whatever tag next to it, and you'll have audiences investing in what they *think* it should be instead of letting the film present itself for what it is. And all they see is that it is not what they expected (expectations, I might add, that are shaped by the current gimmicks and trends in Hollywood).<br/><br/>I love the Exorcist because it dared to defy my expectations. This is not a wall-to-wall, credits-to-credits montage of scary imagery inspired by a mere scenario that's supposed to pass as a plot. This isn't a movie about that long dark corridor and something waiting to jump out of the darkness and attack (which is always preceded by a false scare featuring a cat). It's not about that cheap gimmicky scenario of X amount of people isolated from the rest of the world, with a killer/monster/ghost/whatever on the loose.<br/><br/>The Exorcist is a very slow movie that actually features a full blown plot, its characters, and their associated arcs. The original ambition of The Exorcist was to scare the world with imagery and concepts never before seen in cinema. Shocking moments that the audience of 1973 could not believe they would ever see on the silver screen (from a major studio, no less.) After 30 years, the movie isn't so shocking because times have changed, and the success of the Exorcist has guaranteed countless imitation in all forms across all boards. However, the Exorcist is still one of the most ambition horror films ever made, because (are you ready for this?)  the Exorcist dares to tell a story.<br/><br/>Everyone remembers the pea soup, the head spinning, the vulgarities spewed from the demon's mouth, the stairs, the infamous cut (now restored) spider walk. But I adore this movie for the things no one seems to bring up  I love the setup in Iraq where Father Lancaster Merrin detects the signs of his final showdown, and how these abstract scenes on subsequent viewings give the movie a more epic feel. I love the transition from Chris MacNeil to Father Karras walking across campus that's reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. I became absorbed watching Father Karras caring for his aging mother and the close relationship they have, seeing him depressed and sharing a drink with a fellow priest as he discusses his own issues with faith.<br/><br/>And what impresses me most about a movie named the Exorcist is how it seems to reject the possibility of possession and exorcism as its ultimate and final solution. The characters in the movie don't want it to be true, and in fact don't really even know about the possibility of Exorcism, thus they explore and exhaust all other possibilities (both medical and psychological). I smiled with delight (after all the hospital scenes) in that priceless moment when Chris MacNeil asks Karras, \"And how does one go about getting an exorcism?\" which stops father Karras in his tracks as he, a man of the church, looks at her as though she's lost her mind.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie resists the temptation to jump right into the acknowledgment that Regan is possessed continues to build up the epic Good versus Evil, God versus Satan, the exorcist versus the demon, feel. Like the characters, the movie doesn't want it to be true, it doesn't want to go there and embrace that possibility, but we the audience know what must inevitably happen. And it's almost magical how the movie finally acknowledges Regan's only hope. There's no glorious fanfare nor is there boastful ultimatums, instead the movie lamentingly and silently surrenders to it as we watch Lancaster Merrin walking up the sunny garden path, staring down at a newly delivered envelope. He doesn't have to read it. He already knows what it says, as do we.<br/><br/>The imagery then fades to an ominous foggy night as a taxi pulls up to the MacNeil place in Georgetown, then we're treated to the haunting imagery that inspired the cover art. What must be done, must be done. I love how the movie implies that Merrin has faced this very demon before through its imagery, and through the dialogue as Karras explains he's identified at least three manifestations to which Merrin answers, \"No. There is only one.\" I can address more  the acting, the beautiful cinematography, brilliant makeup  but I'll stop to keep from sounding like a raving fan who over hypes every inch of everything. I'll close with these thoughts: I'm not the type of person who will watch the same movie over and over and over. Most movies I see, the specific imagery and specific ideas don't make a deep enough impression to stick with me for more than a few months. I remember the Exorcist, not because I thought it was the \"scariest movie ever made\", rather because of the wonderful craftsmanship, the fact that it dared to tell a story, and it defied my expectations.<br/><br/>When Friday the 13th, the Grudge, Skeleton Key, and Cursed are reduced to vague memories and general ideas, I will still clearly remember the Exorcist.",
    "This movie is 20 years old, but it's still the most enjoyable movie I've seen in ages. Why can't they make movies like this again?",
    "The film that bested Star Wars for the 1977 Best Picture Oscar, Annie Hall is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking that transcends its simple, romantic premise to create a stunning portrait of not only 70's pop culture, but of human nature cumulative.  Directed and co-written by Woody Allen, who has since directed other gems such as Hannah and Her Sisters and The Purple Rose of Cairo, Annie Hall also stars Allen as Alvy Singer, a neurotic, death-obsessed comedian who seems unlucky in love and life.  That is until he meets Annie, brilliantly played by Diane Keaton, who is beautiful, fashion-savvy, carefree (she likes using expressions like `la di da'), and a terrible driver.<br/><br/>Annie and Alvy's relationship is an unlikely one.  She's a Midwestern girl, straight out of white-bread Wisconsin; he's a life-long New York Jew who grew up (literally) under the Coney Island roller coaster.  He's been seeing a therapist for the past 16 years; she only `needs' one once she meets him. She's an extroverted aspiring singer; he's an introverted, world-despising imp.  Yet Allen and Keaton are so perfect in their roles, they improbably make this couple one of the most memorable ever.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Alvy's chronicles of loves lost and a retrospective on his relationship with Annie, with whom he has since parted ways.  At the end of the film, we see Alvy try his hand at stage-writing-he writes a play about his relationship with Annie, but gives it a happy ending.  Yes, Annie and Alvy don't have a fairy tale ending to their relationship, but Alvy certainly wishes they had, even though he learns to live with the acknowledgment it has failed.<br/><br/>The best part of Annie Hall is its incredible screenplay-the best ever to be written.  Not a word is wasted nor a line unquotable.  Except here, while Allen's early films had thrived on streams of one-liners, Allen doesn't go for cheap laughs-each line is simultaneously hilarious and poignant. Everything is part of a greater whole.  We laugh because it's funny, but there's a greater dynamic at work in Annie Hall.  This is a story not exclusively about a relationship between two people, but also a musing on 70's politics, drugs, East Coast/West Coast rivalry, narcissism, religion, celebrity, and several other topics with which Allen deals with extraordinary ease.<br/><br/>Yet Annie Hall would not be among my favorite films of all-time if it were just Woody Allen ranting and raving about what he likes and dislikes. There are other Allen films that serve that purpose, i.e. Deconstructing Harry, and they're not nearly as good.  What separates Annie Hall is its grace, the believable chemistry between Keaton and Allen, the unique direction (ranging from split-screens to cartoon imagery to on-screen subtitles of what the actors are thinking), but mostly because it's the rare film to find a perfect balance between sheer entertainment, humor, and poignancy.<br/><br/>\nWhen the dust had settled, Diane Keaton deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance, Allen took home Oscars for direction and writing, and the film beat out Star Wars for Best Picture, which most people consider a complete sham.  Evidently, those people didn't see Annie Hall, for if they had, they'd recognize that the acting, writing, and even the direction in Star Wars can't hold a candle to Annie Hall, one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "With poor plotting, inconsistent pacing and a rushed sense of chemistry amongst the new cast Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales exposes the swashbuckling sequel as nothing more than a cash-grab that's as hollow as the ships they occupy.",
    "In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:<br/><br/>First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: \nIs Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?<br/><br/>Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.<br/><br/>During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",
    "Mike Newell is the weirdest choice for director of a Mafia drama, but he actually makes a terrific fist of it, delivering one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are all in top form in front of the camera, too.<br/><br/>Depp plays undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone in this intriguing true story. Pistone is trying to infiltrate his way into a mob family in order to gather evidence against them. He assumes the identity of \"Donnie Brasco\" and slowly but surely earns the love and trust of an old-pro hit-man named Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino). As the months go by, Pistone's marriage begins to fall apart as he is away from his wife (Heche) pretty much all the time. The line between his real life and his undercover life blurs together and he finds himself dangerously close to being seduced by the violent Mob lifestyle.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is an extraordinary film in many ways. As already mentioned, the performances are note-perfect. But there's so much more to it than that. The late 70s period details are impeccably captured; the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic; the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly, agonisingly conveyed. It's such a powerful picture, completely involving, that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament, asking yourself what decisions you would make in the same circumstances. Very few movies genuinely inspire you to debate the whats, whys and wherefores of the main character and his actions... but with Donnie Brasco, that's just what you'll find yourself doing.",
    "One might argue Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film, since it lacks almost everything you'll find in almost all of them: shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers, even blood. The most graphic scene is a nightmare sequence that displays a rape scene so stylized it isn't actually disturbing. But one might also argue that Rosemary's Baby is a horror film in its purest form, since it doesn't depend on all those gimmicks to create its atmosphere. I prefer the latter point of view. <br/><br/>So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly, there is something strange about them - the sounds that come from their apartment, the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbors, and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive, especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant - she recommends her another (better, as she says) gynecologist's and mixes a (healthy, as she says) herbal drink for her every day. <br/><br/>The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant: Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner (Pregnant women are supposed to gain, not lose weight, a visiting friend observes), and when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbors, her gynecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying. <br/><br/>All this is told by Roman Polanski in the perfect tone; the mood for the entire film is already set during the opening credits when we hear that weird lullaby, sung by Mia Farrow. And a lot of strange things happen throughout the entire film: Guy and Rosemary are told by Hutch, a friend of theirs, about the horrific past of the house they're now living in, a young girl that lives with the Castevets commits suicide (really a suicide?), Guy, an actor, gets the role he wanted so badly after the contestant who was originally supposed to play it turns blind, and Hutch, who might have found something out that would help Rosemary, suddenly is in a coma and dies three months later; all these (and a few other) events are precisely dosed by Polanski to draw us more and more into the film, while he makes sure on the other hand that the film doesn't become absurd. And he manages to give the film an ending that works, makes sense and is observant, slightly (but only slightly) funny and very disturbing, all at once. <br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby also contains two of the most memorable performances ever: Mia Farrow is haunting as Rosemary Woodhouse. She looks like she is physically suffering from her pregnancy and close to complete despair. And Ruth Gordon is amazing as the curious Minnie Castevet, always friendly, but also giving you the feeling that, hidden behind her generosity, she actually follows her own, obscure motives. If you have a helpful elderly female neighbor, you'll see her with other eyes once you've encountered Minnie Castevet. So, if you think a real horror film needs shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers or at least blood - watch Rosemary's Baby and you'll change your mind.",
    "Cube is a movie that explores human nature and our instinctive urges for survival vs our humanitarianism. Not a new concept, I know, however this movie does it in style, with a plot so simple that it could only be the work of a conceptual genius. I don't intend to give too much away, as the power of the film lies in it's mystery, but I will say that this movie could almost be classified as disturbing, not due to its content, but rather the thoughts that it instills in the audience. I found myself rather shaken as I left the cinema, feeling as though I had been exposed to an ugly, hidden side of humanity and society. Don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely worth seeing, I would even be so bold as to say that it must be seen! I must admit that there are few movies I have seen that have had such a profound affect on me, and I don't think I am alone in my feelings.",
    "This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun.",
    "I watch a lot of movies & I can't remember the last time a film held me so spellbound. Not only are the characters engaging & vividly portrayed by an excellent cast, the subtle dynamics of their interactions are portrayed with inspired undertone & nuance. Star billing or even an Oscar should also have been awarded to the spectacularly beautiful scenery of Montana for the vast majesty it bestowed.<br/><br/>This complex saga of love, grief & loyalty is narrated with stark simplicity by old Stab, long-time friend to retired Colonel Ludlow & his 3 sons: staid Alfred, the eldest (\"old even for his years\"); idealistic Samuel, the youngest (\"There was nothing these brothers would not do for him.\"); & wild Tristan (\"Such people become crazy or they become legends.\"). The conflict between Ludlow's fiercely anti-government anti-war stance & his sons' determination to do what they see as their duty is but a small part of the story; the heart of the tale is the rift that threatens the mutual devotion of these 3 loyal brothers as they all come to love the same woman. \"She was not to blame,\" Stab tells us, \"She was like the ice that freezes in the rock and splits it apart.\"<br/><br/>A tragic tale, yes; heartbreaking at times, but never boring. Every time I felt certain I knew what was coming next, the plot took another unexpected turn & I sat there riveted, softly breathing \"Wow!\" now & again into the darkness. This film immediately became one of my all-time favorites; I've watched it half a dozen times since then & its scope & power never fail to move me.",
    "At only 29 years of age and in only his second major studio release, Stanley Kubrick showed the world that he was a force to be reckoned with. By the time he died 42 years later his films were epochal events waited for breathlessly by his large band of devotees who considered him a director without equal. He seldom disappointed them.<br/><br/>This movie is set in World War I amidst the incredibly destructive and futile trench warfare between France and Germany. Kirk Douglas plays Frenchman Colonel Dax, who is ordered to make an impossible assault on a heavily-fortified enemy position. The only reason this charge is being made is that his commanding general, played by George Macready, believes that capturing the position will earn him a promotion. When the assault does not go forward under heavy enemy bombardment, the general is infuriated and demands that three men be arbitrarily chosen to stand trial for cowardice, an offense punishable by death. Col. Dax defends these men at their court-martial.<br/><br/>The battle and trial scenes are about as good as have ever been filmed and the high level of tension is sustained throughout the movie. After the film's climax has occurred, Col. Dax goes looking for his troops and finds them relaxing at a cafe. What he and the viewer witness there is possibly the most affecting scene I've ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>Looking at this film in perspective, it's easy to see Kubrick's trademarks even at this early stage of his career. The attention to the composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. I find myself most impressed today with the way he could handle a dramatic story like this one without any innovative techniques or unusual special effects to hide behind, then turn around and make such totally different films like '2001...' and 'Dr. Strangelove...' Other films like 'The Shining' and 'Barry Lyndon' combined a strong story line with breakthrough film techniques. His versatility astonishes me.<br/><br/>Adolphe Menjou also stars as the general who convinces Dax's superior officer to risk the ill-fated charge. Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey and Joe Turkel give strong performances as the men on trial. Turkel turns up 23 years later in another Kubrick film, 'The Shining,' playing the bartender.<br/><br/>You can take your pick: 'Paths of Glory' can rightly be described as one of the greatest war movies of all, or one of the great anti-war films, or as one of Kubrick's best. Or simply one of the best, period.",
    "Reading the back cover of the DVD and seeing that Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley are given top billing, I expected an intelligent King Arthur story. Well, it really wasn't either, although I did find it entertaining. I must not have read the description carefully enough. No matter; overall, it was fun but just a little too silly. I'm beginning to wonder about the discernment of some of these actors, how they can play such intelligent roles for a film or two and then revert to something like this.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story is really a Roman empire one, not a King Arthur story. We only see the tie-in to the later in the last few minutes of the film, in the epilogue. This action story is all about the last Caesar, a small boy, and the last legion that fought as Rome had now been taken over by the Goths. The Roman Empire had come to an end.<br/><br/>Mixed in with that tale was the famous \"excalibur\" sword. We see the origins of that and how it eventually got into the hands of King Arthur. But, once again, that is only explained in the final minutes. However, the sword is used by the good Roman general who protects the last Caesar from the Goths, who want him imprisoned for life, or killed.<br/><br/>What made the story interesting, at least for me, was the chase-scene type atmosphere of a small band of heroes protecting a little boy, fleeing the bloodthirsty Goths until they could mount some sort of counter-attack in the north in Brittania. That, and the pretty computer-generated scenery and action stunts, kept it interesting. However, don't look for credibility in those action scenes and expect the typical political-correctness of today (i.e. where a woman beats up hundreds of men and the good guys of all colors prevail despite ridiculous odds).<br/><br/>Some parts of this will leave you shaking your head in disbelief. You will feel you're watching a kids' film at times. However, if you want an hour-and-a-half of decent escapist fare, and can put your brain on hold for that time, it fits the bill and will at least entertain you.",
    "A stand-alone monument in cinema history, Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions, but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I've never seen a person say, \"2001: A Space Odyssey? I don't think I've seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?\", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you \"get it\" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is \"...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness.\" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that's sheer genius at its highest form.<br/><br/>At its premiere, 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200, including Rock Hudson who asked, \"Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?\" The New York Times remarked, \"Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring.\" \"Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,\" Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 \"trash masquerading as art\". It's understandable, though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk, audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise, 2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.<br/><br/>Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism, Kubrick saw ahead, highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity, respect, and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance, grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man, with his limited senses, cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light), Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty, emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public, for \"if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning\", as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester), it may cause \"cultural shock and social disorientation\". It's a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.<br/><br/>Yet apes are not much better. They're not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes, and with the discovery of bones as weapons, kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors, at heart, mankind has been and will always be selfish.<br/><br/>Far before The Terminator (1984) or The Matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence, there was 2001. H.A.L 9000, voice played by Douglas Rain, was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There's something about his calm voice, unpredictability, and especially, his omniscient single red eye that's so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. Neither Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) or Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film, while H.A.L, albeit a machine, exhibits some while pleading for life singing \"Daisy\" (which, by the way, is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity's fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank, Dave, and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L, contrast to what he may think, is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit, he wouldn't have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race, but if we are not careful, they soon will.<br/><br/>This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence, resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous \"Star Gate\" sequence, Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era, exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground, establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous, magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod, he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating, suggesting that man, no matter how advanced, will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later, he reaches out to the monolith, alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened, he inevitably dies.<br/><br/>A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a \"Space Baby\", an infinitely more advanced race, marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius, Kubrick ends hopeful, giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending, and it's a question for you to answer.<br/><br/>There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001's composition throughout the film, possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony, practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky's work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty, Kubrick's artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot, averaging 13.6 seconds, possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.<br/><br/>But of course, it's impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it's hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects, clever rotating sets, fastidiously constructed spaceships, the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence, or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting, but what's the point? You don't need me to appreciate 2001's immaculate visuals.<br/><br/>Finally, the choice of music is outstanding. Originally, Alex North was appointed to score the film, but Kubrick turned it down in post-production. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly, \"North's (rejected) score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.\"<br/><br/>\"But why all the slow parts?\" asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily, to establish tone. Unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it, 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not, challenges humanity's fate, and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot's average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between, the whole film would've been a mess. Space isn't fast-paced like we see in most movies. Space is slow-really, really, slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius, a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.<br/><br/>Thankfully, its ingenuity was gradually recognized, and it's now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive #6 on the BFI \"Sight and Sound\" Critics' poll in 2012, ties for 2nd in the Director's poll, places 15th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of \"greatest science-fiction films of all time\".<br/><br/>2001: A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags, the dialogue is unnatural, the static camera creates no visual interest, there are barely any emotional punches, characters are monotonous, and none of the protagonists, if there even are, have dimensionality, arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless, it's transcendental and sublime, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, visually revolutionary, technically impeccable, monumentally imaginative, substantially rich, and way ahead of its time, thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.<br/><br/>Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them. Happy 50th birthday.",
    "Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen `losers to winners' sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).<br/><br/>All this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things. You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.<br/><br/>Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.<br/><br/>The comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.<br/><br/>There isn't much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn't fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational `Hoosiers' imitation was misplaced.<br/><br/>This film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel `The Leg' Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.<br/><br/>This film won't be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.  I rated it an 8/10.  Subtract two points if you aren't amused by slapstick and boorish behavior, and another two if you aren't a football fan.  For the rest of you, be prepared to split a gut.",
    "The Favourite, the seventh feature from Greek auteur <a href=\"/name/nm0487166/\">Yorgos Lanthimos</a>, is a film that eschews both convention and expectation. On the other hand, it's also Lanthimos's most accessible by a country mile. A savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power - it's all of these and yet none of them. A film I liked but didn't love, on the one hand, it's too long, the plot too threadbare, and the metaphors and allegories too ill defined. On the other, the acting is flawless, it looks amazing, the first half is very, very funny, and the end is very, very dark, with the last shot one of the most haunting/disturbing images I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Set in England in 1708, the film tells the story of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (an icy <a href=\"/name/nm0001838/\">Rachel Weisz</a>) and one-time scullery maid Abigail Hill (<a href=\"/name/nm1297015/\">Emma Stone</a>, charting a course from doe-eyed ingénue to vicious Machiavellian intrigant) and their increasingly bitter rivalry for the affections of Queen Anne (an absolutely mesmerising <a href=\"/name/nm1469236/\">Olivia Colman</a>), and is the first film Lanthimos has directed which neither he nor <a href=\"/name/nm3328207/\">Efthymis Filippou</a> wrote (the script was originally written by <a href=\"/name/nm7629302/\">Deborah Davis</a> in 1998 and later refined by <a href=\"/name/nm1110111/\">Tony McNamara</a>). Although it deals with real historical personages and events, historians probably won't be too thrilled to learn that Lanthimos is relatively uninterested in either historical actuality or socio-political contextualisation (to say nothing of the slam dancing). This is a story about a love triangle, with everything else just the background noise against which that triangle plays out.<br/><br/>And it is most definitely a Yorgos Lanthimos film, with his peculiar Weltanschauung omnipresent. The emotionless and monotone delivery of dialogue has been scaled back considerably from <a href=\"/title/tt3464902/\">The Lobster (2015)</a> and <a href=\"/title/tt5715874/\">The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017)</a>, but everything else you'd expect is here - the pseudo-omniscient judgemental glare; the dark absurdist humour; the formal rigidity; the emotional isolation of the characters; the surrealism; the games of psychological one-upmanship; the alienation of the audience; the thematic centrality of shifting power relations; the lack of distinction between poignancy and joviality; the use of self-contained and closed off pocket universes where characters must play by rules differing from those of the outside world; intimate familial conflict (except in bigger rooms than in his previous films); and a disorienting score. Similarly, whilst The Lobster was a savage dystopian-set allegory for discipline and conformity, The Favourite is a merciless satire of decadence and pettiness, taking in such additional themes as class, gender, love, lust, duty, loyalty, partisan politics, patriarchal hegemony, and women behaving just as appallingly as men.<br/><br/>As one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless, with many of the compositions having the appearance of a fête galante painting, so meticulously integrated are <a href=\"/name/nm0694309/\">Sandy Powell</a>'s costume design, <a href=\"/name/nm2356249/\">Fiona Crombie</a>'s production design, and <a href=\"/name/nm0752811/\">Robbie Ryan</a>'s cinematography. Powell's costumes are historically inaccurate, but thematically revealing, with the situation of the characters at any given moment directly influencing the design, especially in relation to Abigail as she climbs the social ladder. In a more general sense, the black-and-white colour scheme of much of the wardrobe contrasts magnificently with Crombie's predominantly brown production design, with the actors effortlessly standing out from the backgrounds.<br/><br/>Of Ryan's photography, perhaps the most impressive feat is that, despite the many scenes tracking characters through rooms, up stairs, and out doorways, there's not a single Steadicam shot anywhere in the film. He also makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which distort the spaces the characters occupy whilst also showing much more of the environment than a normal lens, creating the sense of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. Combined with the whip pans seen throughout the film, the cumulative effect is a world rendered strange, a place of distortion and unnatural compositions. As with most of Lanthimos' work, the film also uses natural light, which makes for some stunning candle-lit night-time compositions, partially recalling the paintings of someone like Jean-Antoine Watteau or, even moreso, Georges de La Tour.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, there really are no words to describe just how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she is able to elicit empathy mere moments after behaving thoroughly shamefully, communicating a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Yes, she can be a horrible person with appalling manners and questionable hygiene, but she is also deeply lonely, a survivor who has lost 17 children in childbirth, a woman whose health has made her old before her time, a tragic figure too naïve to see how badly she is being manipulated by Sarah and Abigail. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, illuminating Anne's humanity amongst her least appealing characteristics, and finding both wit and pathos in a character whose mercurial nature and excessive neediness could easily have rendered her the film's antagonist. It truly is one of the finest on-screen performances in a long time.<br/><br/>The film's most salient theme, one could argue its very raison d'être, is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, it's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the men are portrayed as petty, vainglorious idiots. Men, in general, are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped - with their ridiculous wigs and heavy makeup, they exist only to support the women. However, what's especially interesting about the film's depiction of gender is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. Sure, the women are much smarter than the men who surround them, but they are no less greedy or cruel. At the film's post-première press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos explained, \"what we tried to do is portray women as human beings. Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends...Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings.\" Similarly, when asked by the Hollywood Reporter if a film about females treating each other badly might be considered a setback in a post #MeToo era, Colman explained, \"How can it set women back to prove that women fart and vomit and hate and love and do all the things men do? All human beings are the same. We're all multifaceted, many-layered, disgusting and gorgeous and powerful and weak and filthy and brilliant. That's what's nice. It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy.\"<br/><br/>As regards criticisms, although I personally wouldn't class them as flaws, some people will probably dislike the same things that many have disliked in Lanthimos's previous work - cold formal rigidity, perverse sense of humour, and irredeemable characters being irredeemably horrible to one another. There will be those who find the obviously intentional anachronisms too much, whilst others will take umbrage with the disregard for historical authenticity. For me, whilst I admire Lanthimos for trying to bring something new to his oeuvre, especially when compared to Sacred Deer (which just repeated the beats of The Lobster), I felt the film was oftentimes trying to work its way through an identity crisis, unsure of exactly what kind of tone to settle on. I had similar feelings about the allegories that run throughout, and are never what you would call fully fleshed out. Obviously, it's a treatise on power and the ridiculous opulence of royalty, but that's not exactly an untapped issue in cinema. Additionally, one of my biggest problems with Sacred Deer was how utterly pointless it felt, and although I got a lot more out of The Favourite, I had something of the same reaction to it. It could also be argued that the characters are a little two dimensional, and filmgoers who need a protagonist to latch onto, someone to root for, will be left rudderless.<br/><br/>Superior to <a href=\"/title/tt1859446/\">Alpeis (2011)</a> and Sacred Deer, but not a patch on <a href=\"/title/tt1379182/\">Kynodontas (2009)</a> or The Lobster, The Favourite will probably attract a sizable unprepared audience because of awards buzz, positive reviews, and excellent trailer. Undoubtedly, for a lot of people, this will be their first exposure to Lanthimos, and I can only imagine what people expecting a Merchant Ivory costume drama will make of it all. Neither morally enlightening nor historically respectful, The Favourite offers a bleak assessment of humanity's core drives; not Lanthimos's bleakest, but a hell of a lot more nihilistic than an average multiplex goer will be used to. The characters within the film live in a milieu of egotism, narcissism, sexual cruelty, psychological bullying, greed, and hunger for power. There's barely a hint of sentimentality, and very little that could be called morally righteous. I would have liked it to have more meat on its bones, but at the same time, one cannot deny that it presents something of a faithful looking-glass, as Lanthimos continues to corner the market in pointing out not just humanity's worst foibles, but its most egregious eccentricities and lamentable character defects.",
    "I'm usually pretty cynical about cheesy movies but this movie absolutely floored me.  Drew Barrymore was phenomenal playing role of Julia Sullivan. I've seen the movie at least 30 times by now and her expressions still make me cry, they're just so sincere. I don't know how else to put it.  As for Adam Sandler I think that this is his best role yet, he's a real person in this movie not just some overgrown immature goofball.  On top of everything it's a brilliant 80s satire, for me its right up there with American Psycho. I understand why someone would have reservations about watching this movie but my advice would be to put your cynicism aside for a couple of hours and just watch with an uncritical mind.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",
    "Train to Busan was a treat. <br/><br/>A look into Selfishness vs Selflessness and Individual vs The Collective.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a foreign film this much. The cinematography is excellent, the story is original, and I will definitely be keeping an eye on Sang-ho Yeon's future projects.",
    "Cute movie. Has a couple of great messages -- especially one about prejudices. There are some adult jokes, some childish jokes, lots of laugh out loud moments but most importantly the following messages: Hatred against those we don't know is wrong; Let yourself get to know a person before deciding whether they are good or not; and go along for the ride and let yourself enjoy life.<br/><br/>I also love the fact that this is a Dad raising his child situation. There are really few movies that show a Dad can step up and do the right thing for their children if given the chance.<br/><br/>While I didn't particularly care for the fart joke or some of the childish parts the kids in the theater laughed and laughed.<br/><br/>Well done!",
    "I think this film is wonderful. It is sheer entertainment for kids and hilarious for adults.<br/><br/>I first watched this movie age 7, and i loved it...now i watch it again age 14 and I'm howling with laughter. The 'You wanna buy a sundial?' sequence renders me unable to breathe for laughter, whilst when i was younger it got not so much as a giggle.<br/><br/>As with all Disney films, the jokes are for the 'big kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!<br/><br/>Overall - 8/10",
    "I saw this at a special screening. I have not stopped thinking about it since. A emotional and powerful film that I will remember forever. I can't fault anyone who doesn't want to see this film. But please put to rest any fears that this film was made purely to turn a profit and serves no purpose.<br/><br/>For all those who were afraid that this film would be exploitive, propaganda filled Hollywood schlock, I'm sorry to say that could not be farther from the truth.<br/><br/>Though for the most part I'm still at a loss for words I'll do my best to give you a short and sweet overview. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible by making a Hollywood film about this subject everyone is afraid to touch, but made it in such a way that it's hard to find fault, despite everyone's initial misgivings. No 'rah rah' patriotism. No veiled political stances. No cartoonish villains. No making the enemy sympathetic. Just a brilliantly executed look at what did happen and what 'might' have happened on that fateful day.<br/><br/>What makes it more effective is that all throughout you don't recognize any of the actors. They may as well be \"real people\". You're never thinking to yourself, 'oh that's Nicolas Cage', conscious of the fact that it's acting. And come to find out, many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves! This makes it all the more real and draws you in and takes you back to that day.<br/><br/>And when the passengers decide to fight back? There's no swelling of violins or slow motion shots. They don't have a rallying cry or 'lets do it for Uncle Sam' type speech to motivate everyone. No, these passengers were reacting spontaneously to the situation as it played out and were acting on their survival instinct. You can't help but think how you would react in that situation and makes it all the more compelling and powerful. <br/><br/>I won't say this film is for everyone. It IS hard to watch at times. But I'm so glad I did see it. Very cathartic in a way. And trust me, this film couldn't have been done in a more professional, classy way. This feels genuine; of course they are going to 'profit' off it, but you get the sense that the filmmakers and everyone involved poured their hearts into this project and did this to tell a story. A more dignified and heroic story I don't think I've ever seen.",
    "Many people compare \"Once Upon a Time in America\" with \"The Godfather\". In my opinion these two movies can't be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don't compare a Picasso to Michelangelo's Sixteen Chapel either, do you?<br/><br/>What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. <br/><br/>The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut. <br/><br/>The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn't said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.<br/><br/>Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn't left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.<br/><br/>I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.",
    "I have to say I didn't expect this. I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.<br/><br/>The story is about an investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton(Michael Douglas in one of his best roles) who is greedy and self centred and who lives alone in his huge mansion. His brother(Sean Penn) gives him a card telling him to contact the company and it is his birthday present to him. What follows is absolute edge of the seat stuff and it shows David fincher at a time when he made some of the finest movies ever seen in Hollywood. In the midst of all this, he meets a waitress named Christine. Revealing more might spoil the movie for you as it is a fun roller-coaster ride with many twists and turns.<br/><br/>What impressed me about this movie was the atmosphere throughout the movie. It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editing(which is the popular way of making movies today), The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.<br/><br/>I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music. The slow motion sequence at the end is also well done and this has got to be one of the best endings of all time.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.",
    "More thematically compelling and with better action set-pieces, Toy Story 2 is a sequel that is just as good as the original - and one that isn't afraid to go to the more emotional side of storytelling.",
    "The concept of Limitless is fantastic - what would happen if you could take a pill (NZT) that would allow you to use 100% of your brain (instead of the standard 20%) and function on a level higher than you have ever functioned before? The possibilities for such a movie idea are well, limitless - pun intended - but unfortunately, despite some great acting, especially by Bradley Cooper, who plays Eddie Morra - the lead whose life the movie follows throughout it's duration, the film just could not overcome some major plot holes, sloppy writing and nonsensical moments.<br/><br/>LOTS OF SPOILERS...<br/><br/>Many times throughout the film, the script uses PLOT driven storyline instead of CHARACTER driven storyline in order to go from Point A to Point B which the script called for & in the process, didn't make much sense given who the characters were in the picture. Some examples:<br/><br/>1) The movie needed for Eddie to find the NZT stash & money in his Brother in Law's apartment, steal it, get away with it and then take the pill, feel the effects, and use the money to regain his life. Problem? It's absolutely ridiculous to imply that the cops wouldn't have searched him or at the very least patted him down after calling in a murder & going down to the station for questioning. Of course, the huge wad of cash/pills he shoved down the back of his pants would have been found had they searched him so it didn't happen. It's illogical and absolutely ridiculous that he would be able to steal what he did from the apartment, an apartment that he locked himself in when the police initially arrived - and have no issues.<br/><br/>2) The movie needed for the Russian thug to come after Eddie in order to find the NZT, take it and then make trouble for him the entire movie. Problem? It's not believable that super smart Eddie wouldn't remember to pay back the 100k that he borrowed especially when the money was constantly on his mind and he had just made 2 million off of what he borrowed. This is clear cut plot driven over character driven storyline because it's ridiculous for Eddie, the character, to not remember such a basic task, especially when there was direct danger to his life if he forgot.<br/><br/>3) The movie needed for Atwood's lawyer to steal Eddie's stash of pills causing Eddie to spiral out. Problem? Isn't it far fetched to imply that Atwood's henchman killed the woman in the hotel to frame her murder on Eddie at the oft chance that Eddie would retain the same lawyer that worked for Atwood just so he could get close to him to steal his pills for Atwood to save Atwood's life? Huh? How did the henchman/lawyer even know that the pills would be on Eddie to take? They never used to be - the custom suit w/ hidden pocket was something new. He certainly didn't carry them on him back when the woman was initially killed. This whole setup was contrived and made no sense and was based on a lot of coincidences, ones that no one could have predicted.<br/><br/>That is just a few examples of sloppy storytelling. There are also a bunch of basic nit picks that I have like: 1) Why didn't Eddie, who was fearing for his life, buy a gun & train how to use it under the help of NZT? He hires bodyguards and buys a fortress to live in but doesn't purchase a handgun? 2) Why didn't the scientists who made NZT take it themselves in order to use their super smarts to perfect the drug and make it what Eddie's scientists were able to create in the end without the aid of being under the drug's influence? 3) After drinking the Russian's NZT laced blood, why did Eddie lie there on the ground waiting for the henchmen to return so he could poke one in the eye w/ a needle? Why not get out of there? Did we really need that stupid fight scene? 4)Breaking into the safe with a chainsaw in minutes? Impressive 5) Is it really believable that NZT wouldn't have hit the black market and been all over the place?<br/><br/>Lastly - a huge problem I had with Limitless was the happy, Hollywood, contrived Ending. Withdrawal from NZT? Side effects? Once the drug wears off so does the heightened brain activity? No problem - the movie flashes forward 12 months to give Eddie Morra a rainbows, puppies & sunshine like ending where his labs have now created a pill that works like NZT only there are no side effects and the super smart effects are permanent. How nice! He's all happy now & brilliant forever & running for Senate - he's with his girlfriend & their ordering food and look, he's fluent in a foreign language because he's so smart and YUCK. The ending was so over the top in an 'everything worked out in the end' way. I hated it. I didn't need for Eddie to die or crash and burn or anything like that but Limitless took the concept of a happy ending to another level.<br/><br/>Also, with the ending comes a rushed attempt to villanize De Niro's character of Carl Van Loon who out of no where makes a pathetic power play by trying to blackmail Eddie & is quickly shot down. The whole scene between them fell flat for me and felt incredibly sloppy and quickly put together.<br/><br/>Overall, in spite of all the shortcomings, Limitless is still a really good movie. It's thrilling, fast paced and the basic concept is interesting and makes for an entertaining film - you just can't really think about things like logic or else you will be disappointed. 7/10",
    "OK - if you've already seen the movie and hated it, my review won't change your mind, so move along folks, move along, there's nothing to see for you here, thanks.<br/><br/>Now for you, dear film fan, who is about to watch 'The Hateful Eight', but who is now slightly worried because of some very mixed critical reactions - for YOU I'm writing this 100% spoiler-free review.<br/><br/>Judging from many comments here on IMDb and other forums, I gather that many long-time Tarantino fans apparently don't like his newest film. I had feared such a reaction as soon as I had finished watching the movie. It's obviously Tarantino's least accessible effort yet, and there's a number of reasons for that, not the least of which being that this is simply not the film most people expected (or felt they were promised). So if you haven't seen it yet and you're a bit doubtful because of the negative reviews, let me tell you: you'll likely end up loving it - as I did - IF you prepare yourself juuuust a little. And because I really liked the movie, I would like to help you do that via a short list of recommendations. Ready? Here it goes:<br/><br/>1. Don't go watch 'The Hateful Eight' expecting a \"classic\" Western. It might belong to the Western genre, but if all that talk about Ultra 70mm Panavision had you thinking of lush outdoor scenery, vast landscapes or anything resembling a Sergio Leone movie, you'll end up disappointed. There are a few nice shots showing snowy mountains, but 95% (perhaps more) of the story unfolds indoors (in one single room) - which isn't to say that the cinematography isn't absolutely fantastic. In fact, it's more than fantastic: it's stunning and worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>2. Don't expect any exciting \"action\" scenes (for lack of a better word: I don't mean the 'Fast & Furious' kind of action scenes) every 10 minutes or so; in fact, don't expect anything other to happen between the characters than dialog for a loooooong time. Unlike in Tarantino's previous films where we got almost \"spoiled\" by unexpected over-the-top moments in nearly every scene (except maybe for 'Jackie Brown' and 'Deathprooof'), this film has a very, very slow build. But: that's not to say it ISN'T exciting (or that nothing does happen) - it's just that the excitement and tension result mainly from the dialog and the excellent performances by the cast (at least for roughly two thirds of the movie).<br/><br/>3. Best approach this film as you would theater; for that's what 'The Hateful Eight' really is: a stage play disguised as a movie. A stage play of a \"Who-Done-It\" murder mystery with a touch of Agatha Christie. But then again, that's also a disguise, for the murder mystery is just a ploy to cast a look at a torn society rife with racial tension after the civil war. Which, of course, again serves as an allegory for race relations in modern-day America and as the director's angry commentary on how hateful that situation still is today, on all sides. Now that sounds awfully serious, but don't worry; despite some hard-to-stomach ugliness and the highly political undercurrent, there is plenty of Tarantino's trademark humor throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>4. Don't expect to find a likable character you can root for. There's a reason for the film's title, and unlike in all his previous films, there is not a single person in Tarantino's latest movie you'll feel any real sympathy for. All the main characters have committed despicable, hateful acts, and they're all beyond redemption - but that doesn't mean they're not compelling to watch (especially given THIS cast: everyone is fantastic, but Jackson, Russell, Jason Leigh and Goggins are just a joy to watch).<br/><br/>5. Don't expect a complex plot. In my opinion, among Q.T's films this is the one with the most straight forward and most simple plot to date, yet at the same time it's arguably his most complex - and most ambitious - film.<br/><br/>So, dear film fan, that's it: adhere to these here 5 \"commandments\", and there's a big chance you'll end up loving Mr. Banana Chin's latest oeuvre as much as I did (mind; you might love the film just as much without taking any of the above advice). I admit, it took me a while to get into this dialog-heavy stage play and would-be Western, but once I did, I never looked back (and I can hardly wait to watch it again). 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",
    "Many people say the cried at the end of this movie... Huh! Knowing the plot already, I (a grown up man) can barely hold my tears from the very beginning whenever I watch it. Much more than just a \"cute and sad fairy tale\", this movie is a true piece of art. This is one of those rarest cases when a bunch of talented and truly, but truly dedicated people set out to create something beautiful, some chemistry occurs and ... a miracle happens. Fortunately for all of us, this miracle immortalized on film.<br/><br/>Throughout the human history, the wisdom of generation was conveyed through fairy tales. This tale is no exception. This story, told in magic simplicity, actually has some deep philosophical meanings. While mercilessly debunking the true nature of human beings, this tragic story really tears your heart, and yet it fills it with hope. That is the true and, perhaps, the only purpose of art, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Why do we need music, painting, theatre, poetry? Is there a real excuse for their existence? To me, the only purpose, the only excuse is to help people go on, to give them hope. And it's well worth it!<br/><br/>To sum up, easily Tim Burton's best, this film is a masterpiece, my favorite American movie, and probably one of the best movies of all times. 10/10",
    "I have been waiting for the right time to review this film. I did not feel until today that I was truly ready to say all I had to say about director Rob Reiner's unforgettable staple of 1980s pop culture. When I first saw The Princess Bride, I was only 7 years old, and hardly cognizant of film as anything but a pastime. While I remember the movie as being enjoyable, I did not have anywhere near as strong a liking or appreciation for it as I do now. I certainly did not remember the film as a theater-going experience, and recently, I got the chance to view it, on the big screen, with at least fifty others in attendance at a midnight screening.<br/><br/>Personally, I am one of those people who, by nature, absorbs memorable quotes, and by that token, the entirety of The Princess Bride is fair game. As I sat there watching, I could always hear somebody, if not more than one person, at least whispering along with the movie under his or her breath. Meanwhile, I noticed that there was a wide disparity of age groups. There were pre-teens, teens, people in their twenties, thirties, and some that looked well past forty. If the showing had not been at midnight, I do not doubt that there would have been pre-pre-teens as well.<br/><br/>With a screenplay written by William Goldman (based on his book), The Princess Bride is a classic, familiar story of a princess, her true love, and the forces that come between them. As is evidenced by those in attendance, this is a story for all ages. The manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by Goldman and Reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film. As any fan of the movie will tell you, however, it is the film's whimsical, irreverent, pervasive tongue-in-cheek antics that make it an unqualified masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you hang around people who love this film, do not be surprised if they react to unbelievable situations with the exclamation, \"Inconceivable!\" Likewise, if you tell them to just wait a minute, don't be thrown aback when they suddenly sport a Spanish accent in saying, \"I hate waiting.\" And if you suddenly, from out of nowhere, hear, \"Hello.my name is Inigo Montoya.you killed my father.prepare to die,\" don't worry. It's not your fault, and you're not going to die.<br/><br/>While The Princess Bride has the sort of satirical edge more geared towards adults, the film is equally effective as a pure fairytale, and for this reason, there is a little something for everyone. In addition, the film enacts a self-referential tribute to the power and beauty of fairytale stories, even in the current age in which many consider them archaic and obsolete.<br/><br/>A sick grandson (Fred Savage), who is spending his time mindlessly playing video games (of the nostalgic Atari 8-bit type), gets a visit from his grandfather (portrayed through a wonderful performance from Peter Falk). To the grandson's dismay, his elder has brought a book to read to him. When he expresses disapproval at his grandfather's old-fashioned ways, the grandfather's response is, \"When I was your age, television was called books.\" Even this quote stands out as resonant and memorable.<br/><br/>The grandson starts out expressing skepticism and boredom, but of course, as the reading of the story progresses, this gradually gives way to captivation and praise. Buttercup (Robin Wright, in her breakthrough role) is a fair-haired, stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged to the smug, cowardly Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), the prince who rules over the land of Florin. She of course does not love him, and she has been without joy since her true love, a farm boy named Wesley (Cary Elwes), was reportedly murdered on the seas.<br/><br/>Of course, without Wesley, there is no story of true love, and we know that he must miraculously return to her someday. This happens through an extraordinary, and increasingly hilarious, set of circumstances. A group of three bandits kidnap Buttercup with the intent of killing her to precipitate a war between Florin and its enemy, Guilder. These three are (in order of increasing stature) the intellectually pompous Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), the Spanish swordsman Inigo (Mandy Patinkin), and the big-hearted slow-witted giant Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant, in one of the most no-brainer casting decisions in all of film history).<br/><br/>During the kidnapping, however, a mysterious man in black closes in on the trail of the three abductors, and it is this man who takes on each of the three one by one in battles of skill, strength, smarts, and of course, deliciously witty repartee. There is something unusually extraordinary about these battles, however.<br/><br/>With the exception of Vezzini, the abductors are not villains as we might initially perceive them to be. The marvelously choreographed swordplay between the man in black and Inigo, and the hilarious absurdity of the handfight with Fezzik, are not at all about winning or losing. They embody a sense of honor, sportsmanship, and nobility that is rarely exemplified in competition (both fictional and real).<br/><br/>Inigo, Fezzik, and the man in black do not display their skills pretentiously or flauntingly. Instead, they take a strong sense of inner pride in the subtle mastery of their arts. As a result, when we see them engage in competition, there is not a sense of enmity, but a wonderful air of camaraderie.<br/><br/>Also included in the mix are a sadistic count (Christopher Guest) with an odd physical characteristic and a penchant for pain, an albino (Mel Smith) with a stuffy throat, the deadly wrath of an R.O.U.S., and a clergyman (Peter Cook) who makes Elmer Fudd seem eloquently spoken. Most memorable, perhaps, is the appearance of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the miracle-man Max and his wife. It has been reported that in the middle of filming this scene, Reiner was forced to leave the set, because Crystal's improvisations were causing him to laugh to the point of being sick.<br/><br/>Regarding the film's casting, every single choice, without exception, is absolute perfection. Cary Elwes not only easily looks the part of a daring, ingenious hero, but as an actor, he has an incredible gift for a subtle mixture of drama and comedy, one that easily coincides with the film's sensibilities. Robin Wright easily essays the role of the headstrong princess, endlessly devoted to her love (with a convincing British accent, despite her American origins).<br/><br/>For the scene of swordplay, Elwes and Patinkin had to study fencing for months, which is impressive, but on-screen, I had no trouble believing that they were characters who had studied for at least several years. Despite his limited acting ability, wrestler Andre the Giant is perfect for the role of Fezzik, and something would be lost with any other actor in his place. And of course, Wallace Shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the diminutive, perpetually exasperated Vezzini.<br/><br/>We also don't have to hear Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon speak any lines to know they are portraying villains. The arrogance, callousness, and sliminess are readily apparent in their facial and bodily expressions.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, we have witnessed a wide variety of hilarity, captivating acts of love and heroism, and of course, one of the most satisfying acts of retribution ever put on film (one that immortalizes the film's most famous quote and chooses just the right time and placement for the film's sole swear word).<br/><br/>For someone who watches this film for the first time, and quickly catches on to the film's capricious mix of reverence and satire, the film is a marvel to watch simply for the knowledge that you do not know what will come next. Will there be a touching moment? A reflective one? An act of bravado? Or will our expectations be subverted in an act of comical subterfuge? The answer: any of them will do, as the film has a delectable variety of all of them.<br/><br/>From start to finish, The Princess Bride is a transcendent, magical experience that constantly elicits uproarious laughter and simultaneously immerses the audience in a rich, magnificent, and almost nostalgic world of folklore that, after the end credits roll, seems timeless and undying. In the years since its release in 1987, it has grown into a cult film of legendary status, and judging by the wide variety of ages I witnessed at the screening (as well as the endless barrage of quoting), it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that the film will endure for many years to come.",
    "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) is more than a sequel to a cult classic film from The Evil Dead (1981) this film is more of a prequel to the Army of Darkness (1992) that was made 5. years later. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is my number 1 favorite film best Evil Dead movie in the franchise. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I love this film to death and I love it so damn much. I enjoy this film a lot, it is one of my favorite movie's in the trilogy. <br/><br/>This is a great movie fun gory entertaining kick-ass sequel. It has action, comedy and horror mixed together that is why I love this film to death! Bruce Campbell is pure fun bad-ass Ash I absolutely love him in this sequel. I miss the 80's and that really best action gory movies un like they are today.<br/><br/>This sequel to the original movie is the perfect balance between the horror of the original and the silliness of the third installment. It succeeds because it has fun with the \"B\" movie genre, never claiming to be better than it is while employing witty direction and dialogue. The scene I remember most is when blood splashes on the lightbulb, making the room glow red. <br/><br/>The first time I watch it, this film really confused me a lot because I thought it was sequel to The Evil Dead but it had a lot of changes, which I love that. I have enjoyed a lot of this film, it is one of my second favorite movie's of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is pure fun and it's witty. Don't get me wrong I love both of Evil Dead films, but I just prefer Army of Darkness more, because it has funny scenes and it has a happy ending, those two films doesn't have happy endings, that is why I love Army of Darkness much better. The film it is just more of the same thing. Literally. But don't take that as such a negative thing. With the success of the low-budget original under his belt, director Sam Raimi re-imagined his first draft and added many elements he just did not have either the time or the money to accomplish on the first pass. On some level, the film certainly works as a nightmare that has to be replayed by our poor reluctant hero Ash. second Evil pairing of writer-director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell doesn't pick up from where the first Evil Dead left off, it instead reinvents some of the same characters from the first film, notably Campbell's daffy hero Ash and putative girlfriend Linda (played by Denise Bixler in this film), and plops them back in the same basic plot setup as the first film, in a kind of horror-comedy Groundhog Day scenario.<br/><br/>Once again Ash visits an isolated cabin in the woods, turns on a tape recorder that has a professor spouting verbiage from the Necronomicon, and the next thing you know, all hell has broken loose, quite literally. Raimi is a director who may not win points for finesse, but he works in a manic, breathless style that is perfectly suited for the outré black comedy of the Evil Dead franchise, and that devil may care, throw caution to the wind spirit is what has made the Evil Dead trilogy (Army of Darkness was the third film, though there's evidently a Raimi-Campbell remake of the original Evil Dead in the offing) such a cult sensation and what continues to draw audiences to the films to this day. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is an extremely gruesome affair, but it's also laugh out loud hilarious a lot of the time, with Campbell's intentionally arch delivery and wide-eyed crazed, cartoonish performance style making the most of Raimi and co-scenarist Scott Speigel's reinvention of the Evil Dead premise. <br/><br/>Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is really a sly, if sometimes sinister, comedy, one blacker than, well, death, but which delivers some consistent guffaws mixed in with the more typical \"avert your eyes\" blood and guts.<br/><br/>Ash (Bruce Campbell), the sole survivor of THE EVIL DEAD, returns to the same cabin in the woods and again unleashes the forces of the dead. With his girlfriend possessed by the demons and his body parts running amok, Ash is forced to single- handedly battle the legions of the damned as the most lethal - and groovy - hero in horror movie history! Welcome to EVIL DEAD II, director Sam Raimi's infamous sequel to THE EVIL DEAD and outrageous prequel to ARMY OF DARKNESS!<br/><br/>Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is a 1987 American horror comedy film directed by Sam Raimi and a parody sequel to the 1981 film The Evil Dead. The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration Crimewave), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.<br/><br/>I love this film and Army of Darkness!!!!",
    "William Shakespeare's famous tragedy is brought to the screen on a large scale. Full of his intricate and unique style of writing, this play focuses on Macbeth.\n....\nWhat I did not expect to see is that the landscape of Scotland becomes not just the scenery background but one of the main storytelling streams. One sees too many modern adaptations of Japanese interpretation of Macbeth that one seems to forget where the story came from in the first place. Truly magnificent cinematography in this version of Macbeth and it really lives up to bloodbath on the battlefields as stated in the Bard' s words. One of the best movies in 2015",
    "Completely brilliant. This film is amazing in its characterization, its pacing, its character development and its visuals.\nThe book is superb, but Stanley is a genius who has a midas touch.<br/><br/>Glory glory violence.",
    "I was reluctant to see this movie. As a veteran of Desert Shield/Storm, I spent my first 90 days in-theater in the Weapons Co of A Swofford's Battalion. I later was moved to the 1st Bn of 7th Marines, but having been in the same unit for some of the same time I felt I could offer readers a unique perspective on the film's accuracy.<br/><br/>From a purely aesthetic perspective I thought the film was well done. The acting was very good, and the script was well written, witty, and accurate. The actors were well suited to their roles. My personal preference for a good plot would have been disappointed were it not for my personal interest in the film. In my opinion this film is an outstanding dramatic-documentary, so adjust your expectations accordingly. If you are expecting a driving plot line and all the accompanying dramatic tension, then I think you will be disappointed (as many whose comments I heard exiting the theater certainly were). But if you think of it as a chance to take a glimpse into a point in history, and see it as some of those who lived it did, then I think you will be impressed.<br/><br/>Many people may think that the obscenity of some of the interactions was overdone for effect. But whatever anyone's personal judgment of that behavior, that is the closest portrayal of Marines (or soldiers) being themselves I have yet seen on screen. Marines are vulgar. They do watch porn. They do fight among themselves. They do both hate, and love, the Marine Corps. There is an omni-present anti-war conspiracy theorist. The do say ridiculous things. There are some who are over the line. The reality of the Marine Infantry is that things happen there every day that are well beyond conventional sensibility, and which strain credibility to the average civilian. It's all true. I love the Marine Corps and I am still serving - I don't have an axe to grind. It just happens to be true.<br/><br/>Are there parts of the film that I find incredible? Yes. But they are not the essential things. There is a scene, it's even in the trailer, in which everyone is firing their weapon into the air. I wasn't there, but I can't fathom a breach of discipline on that scale. I can't say it's impossible, but I am doubtful. But whether it's true or not is not important. At its essence this is a film about Marines, how they adjusted to the Marine Corps, each other, and a war. If there are a few incredible details, then we can just be grateful that Hollywood didn't impose a car-chase on us.<br/><br/>This is a film about Marines. At that time, there were very few who turned down scholarships to Ivy League schools to come in. We were from strange backgrounds. We were obscene. We did want to get our kills. Many of us were frustrated that our war was only 100 hrs long. We knew we were filling the footsteps of giants - the Marines of Iwo, The Chosin, Belleau Wood - and I think we all wanted a chance to earn a place next to those men. In our wild, adrenalized youth, those aspirations just took the crude form of looking for a kill. Or at least that's how I've put it in perspective 15 years later.<br/><br/>If you go and see this film, try to recall yourself at 18 (as I was). Suspend your judgment of the obscenity and vulgarity until you're sure you would've done it differently. I can't speak for Swofford, but I am still incredibly proud of my service there. The insanity of this film reminds me why: because it is characteristic of the immense hardship that our youth bears on behalf of the rest. Do the characters look stressed? It's not hyperbole. We were 18 and we thought we were going to die over there. Still, at H-Hour, everyone marched North. In my opinion, you better fill some big shoes before you judge that. <br/><br/>So don't go into this film champing at the bit to pigeon-hole it as \"Anti\" or \"Pro\" war, with all the pre-fab rhetoric that comes with such a judgment. You have an opportunity here to look back into our little moment in history. Swofford has invited you into our memories. They are not Right, and they are not Left, they are just our story as Swofford lived it. If that kind of thing interests you, then go and see this movie.",
    "As a huge Woody Allen fan, I was delighted and surprised by this film.  I have scarcely heard anyone mention it, but for my money it is the single most comically dense of all of Woody's films.  There are so many truly impressive/hilarious/memorable one-liners that I'm amazed people don't quote this movie left and right. The setting, costumes, accents all add to the hilarity of the film--truly reminiscent of a Marx Brothers romp.  Really outstanding among his pre-Annie Hall films.  Only rivaled by Bananas in my opinion for simple laugh value.<br/><br/>Unlike any other of his films, this deals with his \"deep\" questions of death/metaphysics in an unflaggingly light and comical fashion.  For instance:<br/><br/>Sonja: But judgment of any system or a priori relation of phenomena exists in any rational or metaphysical or at least epistemological contradiction to an abstracted empirical concept such as being or to be or to occur in the thing itself or of the thing itself.<br/><br/>Boris: Yeah, I've said that many times.<br/><br/>Not Woody's \"best\" film (see Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanors), but perhaps his most laugh-filled. Satisfying throughout.  I give it a 9/10.",
    "I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.<br/><br/>It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.<br/><br/>Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). <br/><br/>What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).<br/><br/>So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/",
    "Caution: spoilers may abound. I think this movie is severely underrated. Most complaints I see are of people who can't let go of the vision of superman they got from Christopher reeve who played a superman who was a god among men who never made mistakes and always knew what to do. That's not someone we relate to in this day and age because in our cynical and jaded society it's impossible to be that morally upright. I like Henry Cavill's superman because he plays a man who has to learn how to be superman. He's not perfect out the gate and he doesn't automatically know how to handle every situation right out the gate. Because of this a lot of lives are lost in the battle of metropolis and superman is forced to end zod because there is no other recourse because there is no way to contain him on earth with all the kryptonian tech is destroyed. Whatever you can say about how believable it is that superman didn't have a choice it's still set up well. Krypton was very beautiful and Russell Crowe made a great jor el. As far as the plot for the movie I understand the criticism that the flashbacks don't make sense but I think the death of Jonathan Kent is done very well because it's a sacrifice intended to keep Clark undercover. All in all its not perfect but it's far from terrible.",
    "I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this one isn't even in the TOP 100.<br/><br/>This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:<br/><br/>-The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.<br/><br/>-The Emperor was Finally Revealled: Well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw The Emperor as kids.<br/><br/>-The Speeder Bike Chase: Alright, so this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!<br/><br/>-The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Moment)<br/><br/>-The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.<br/><br/>All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story.",
    "How do I start? I love this film! It has a great plot line and incredible music. It is a fun musical that makes you want to get up and dance.<br/><br/>Grease is the story of Danny Zucko and Sandy Olsen (or Dumbruski) two high school seniors who fall in love over the summer. They have a wonderful summer together and are sad to see it end. The first day of school arrives and little does Danny know him and Sandy would soon be reunited. But Sandy is shocked to find the nice guy she meet at the beach is the leader of a greaser gang called 'The T'birds' Meanwhile Sandy is trying to fit in with her new \"friends\" the T'birds female counterparts The Pink Ladies. Will Sandy and Danny ever be together again? Along with this plot comes song that will be stuck in your head for centuries. Such songs include Summer Nights, Beauty School Dropout and the now famous song Greased Lightining. Grease is a timeless classic that will have you singing and dancing by the end of the movie.",
    "I loved this movie, it's so funny :D one of the best comedy movies ever!!! It has (like many movies) a message, that it's best to tell the truth, but above all it was very funny. My favorite scene was: <br/><br/>About Mr. Allen <br/><br/>Miranda: Well, what do you think of him? Fletcher: He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless steaming pile of cow dung, figuratively speaking. a moment passes and Mr. Allen starts laughing. The other board members follow his lead and start laughing also] Mr. Allen: That's the funniest damn thing I have ever heard. You're a real card, Reede. I love a good roast. Do Simmons. Fletcher: Simmons is old. He should have been out of the game years ago but he can't stay home because he hates his wife. You have met her at the Christmas parties, she's the one that gets plastered and calls him a retard, and you, Tom; you're the biggest brown nose I have ever seen. You have got your head so far up Mr. Allen's ass, I can't tell where you end and he begins. Mr. Allen: *roaring with laughter* Priceless! *Fletcher continues with every member* Fletcher: You have bad breath caused by gingivitis. You couldn't get a porn star off. Your hairpiece looks like something that was killed crossing the highway. I don't know whether to comb it or scrape it off with a shovel and bury it in lime. Loser! Idiot! Wimp! Degenerate! *Slut*! Mr. Allen: I like your style, Reede! That's just what this stuffy company needs - a little irreverence! Fletcher: Good! I'll see you later, dick-head! <br/><br/>Great movie!!!",
    "Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as \"Sergeant Major Dickerson\",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.",
    "Overall I enjoyed the movie. There have been too many recent films about the Tudors and Elizabeth in particular, but this film looks good and it keeps you entertained. It's set at the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Elizabeth is shown as tough, smart, and married to her country. She also suffers from bouts of insecurity and irrational jealousies. This film is more hagiographic and melodramatic than its predecessor. <br/><br/>The film tends to ignore the facts when they get in the way of the story. Elizabeth was 55 at the time of the Spanish Armada and she was never a looker. Blanchett's Queen is youngish and attractive. Blanchett's acting performance is powerful and impressive but also a bit stagy. The way the politics of the time are depicted is a bit too black and white. The Spanish look grim and are dressed in dark colors. They are portrayed as crazy, religious zealots. Spain had a right to be upset at English privateers / pirates who attacked their ships and stole their gold. Mary, Queen of Scots is shown as a dowdy, schemer who disliked Elizabeth. The reality was that Mary was a pretty bimbo who made bad choices when it came to men.<br/><br/>Parts of the film veer too much towards soap-opera. Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen)becomes a favorite, but when Bess Throckmorton, one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting and Raleigh get secretly married, Elizabeth becomes jealous and behaves badly. Later, Raleigh and Francis Drake are shown defeating the Spanish at sea. In reality Raleigh was looking after the coastal defenses in the South West of England and didn't marry Throckmorton until 1591. The real Raleigh was a brilliant man: soldier, explorer, writer, poet and courtier and probably deserves his own film. The film is good fun but it's simplistic, cartoon history.",
    "I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was simply delighted.<br/><br/>I saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie, but then found it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started trying to justify liking this flick on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going way overboard: the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man; (b) the extensive male-female humor arising out of that basic conceit; and (c) some of the names (including Viola & Duke).<br/><br/>Aside from those names, the thematic commonalties (a & b) are really great themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. Beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary/traditional teen flick. And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like alluding to Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The movie is bright, fast-paced, emotive, stylized, funny ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and male/female humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part IMHO: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing over-the-top fun. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately, with such a complexity of invention that I'm still a little bewildered ... but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard, it's not that kind of a movie: things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next split-second happening.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes really is just delightful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke; David Cross does a wonderfully over the top Principal Gold. All of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. Cinematography was excellent.<br/><br/>Wonderful entertainment from beginning to end ... check it out!",
    "Gravity is a wonderful work of art. Cuaron and Lubezki are at their visual storytelling bests, which is quite a statement. The shots of outer space are long and gorgeous, and the sound design is impeccable, both encompassing the vastness and silence of space as well as letting us see Ryan's perspective. The grounded, careful science of the film and the exceptional effects and camera work give us a sense of what space is like - a tall order. What brings Gravity to the next level is the level of personal connection we reach with Kowalski, and especially Ryan. I felt nervous and scared every time Ryan was faced with a seemingly impossible situation. It is so impressive that Cuaron could get us to connect with Ryan and make every moment so thrilling despite having next to no dialogue and only having two characters in the whole film! The scene where Kowalski returns and enters the shuttle was far and away the scene of the movie for me, especially as it hit me that it was in her mind. The score is effective in heightening tension. Gravity is a groundbreaking work of art that, despite its narrow focus on just Ryan's journey, he manages to both amaze us visually and thrill us, start to finish.",
    "Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original \"Willy Wonka\" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",
    "My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.<br/><br/>\nFor someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:\n<ul><li>Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.</li><li>The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular \"Nolan's spirit\" in it.</li><li>The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.</li><li>Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.</li><li>Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/>\nSPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!<br/><br/>It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - \"extractors\" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of steeling, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called \"inception\". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels \"dream within a dream\", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.<br/><br/>The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.<br/><br/>\nSome short lines about the cast:\n<ul><li>Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.</li><li>Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).</li><li>There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...</li><li>Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.</li><li>Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.</li><li>Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.</li><li>Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.</li></ul>",
    "Even before the final credits rolled, I strongly suspected this movie would end up on my Top 20; in fact, perhaps even my Top 10. A teenage boy, his hearing impaired from having just been at the site of a bombing, and a young woman clutching at him, the two of them stumbling and sludging through a slimy, smelly bog. A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don't need vast, elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers' comments on the movie, it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most \"satisfying\". A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn't really get going until the second half. For me, it was the first half that got under my skin the most, for its cinematic originality, poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement, but it's only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman, defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also, never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed, and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema, rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn't always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See, rape is shown as nothing but pure, unadulterated, hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial, external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film, you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars. <br/><br/>On another subject, whoever thinks this movie contains \"propaganda\" is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it's a Soviet production, and should think things over a little more carefully. It's astonishing how you can still find little traces of the Cold War mentality surviving to this day, even in younger viewers... The fact that as detractors of Come and See claim, Stalin \"was no better than Hitler\" has nothing to do with anything at all, in this movie's context - Klimov's picture is NOT about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant - it's about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war - ANY war, though this one happened to be going on in Bielorussia. There was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan than the whole of Come and See. This is painful, sublime cinema. I've always believed there's something special about Russians when it comes to producing art, especially literature - this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression in me.",
    "Like many of you, the first time I saw the trailer for The Lego Movie (2014) I thought to myself, \"Are you kidding me?!\" Yet another movie based on a franchise of toys aimed towards families willing to cough up the cash just to shut their kids up. Can't we for once make movies for kids that don't dull the senses? Have we truly come to the point where there are no original thoughts? Yet after seeing not just families but college kids' line up to see sold out viewings I became interested. In addition, The Lego Movie managed to muster a staggering 93% on rottentomatoes.com, an unheard of fresh score in the February film graveyard. In short; curiosity got the best of me.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong about this film. I honestly couldn't have been more wrong about a film in my life. The Lego Movie is not only the must see film of the late winter season, I'm going to go ahead and call it now; it's the best family-oriented film for all ages of 2014. Okay maybe not but at the very least it's a very high bar to set.<br/><br/>The story busts out of the gate from the get-go; Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) a wizard and \"master builder\", while protecting a mystery weapon is blinded by Lord Business (Will Ferrell), obviously our caped and big booted villain. Before Vitruvius is kicked into the abyss by Business and his robotic minions, he foretells of a hero, the \"special\" who will put an end to his dastardly plans, whatever they might be. The next morning Emmet a seemingly ordinary Lego construction worker goes about his normal day. He comes across a woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for \"the piece of resistance\" which he unwittingly finds and becomes beholden to. Now it's up to Emmet and some newfound friends to fulfill the prophecy.<br/><br/>It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. Yet within The Lego Movie's brick-blocked world, everything including the story feels incredibly new and original. Children, especially the young will enjoy the fast action, laugh-a-minute jokes, sly slapstick and goofy characters. Obvious kid favorites will include perma-smiled Unikitty (Alison Brie) and zany 80's throwback astronaut Benny (Charlie Day) whose ability to create spaceships is frustratingly overlooked. Plus there's Batman (Will Arnett)Batman! <br/><br/>The older crowd however will be astounded not only with the seamless CGI effects but with the subversive element throughout the film. Yes a goofy, kiddy film of such unrestrained chirpiness can be positively incendiary, at least in this case. Throughout the film there are Orwellian elements tucked underneath crafty pop-culture references ranging from Star Wars (1977) to Harry Potter. There are mischievous pokes at what Henry David Thoreau referred to as \"(leading) lives of quite desperation.\" <br/><br/>Finally there's cheeky satire aimed at the Danish toy brand itself. Much of the conflict revolves around \"master builders\" who build whatever they want out of the parts they find versus Lord Business who wants everything built \"according to the directions.\" This particular theme struck the kid inside me as I was very fond of Legos. Younglings may not realize that back in the day, pre-designed Lego play sets took a back seat to the now impossible to find Lego Creative Bucket sets. To the uninitiated that particular red bucket set was an amalgam of potential foot sores but to this writer, those 200+ pieces were a gateway to an unlimited creative space.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie accurately and effectively recreates that creative space through accessible movie magic. It exhibits a fun hero story that may not be treading new narrative ground but nonetheless feels fresh and new. Finally the themes and occasionally biting humor makes The Lego Movie a kid's film that isn't just for kids but the child in all of us. This February do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an adventure story unlike any other. Then go home and order some Legos online! I know I am.",
    "First of all, it is an Adam Sandler movie. If you hate Adam Sandler movies, then you won't like this.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8/10 because it was one of the better Adam Sandler movies. The plot and storyline was better than I expected; the development was pretty good as well. There were definitely a lot of points where I had to slap my forehead b/c it was silly funny.<br/><br/>Yeah, its highly unrealistic, but if you expected realism, whats wrong with you? Sure, Jennifer Anniston is the \"uglier chick,\" which is like saying a million dollars isn't that much money, but she did a good job in the movie.<br/><br/>The only complaint I had was Adam Sandler used all the lines I planned on using with the girl I took to see it!",
    "I'll start this off with a warning. If you're a mainstream horror fan, you will not like this. It is not The Conjuring, it does not have jump scares, it is a slow movie. It's not scary in the way that most horror films are scary. It doesn't frighten you. It felt traumatic. This is an artsy movie for sure. If you don't like that, don't see it.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh is absolutely phenomenal. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invensted in such a disturbing film. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunningly gorgeous. I've never seen a film look so gory and grotesque and yet absolutely beatiful at the same time. It's some of the best cinematography that I've seen in years. The art direction is also phenomenal in providing us with a floral, candy colored, nightmare world.<br/><br/>And Ari Aster's screenplay and direction is what makes this so special and separates it from other horror pieces. It's slow, methodical, eerie. But the characters are psychological and deep. The dialogue is real and colorful. The plot is surreal and disturbing. He let's the scares crawl at you as opposed to jump at you. He allows you to see what will happen, process it, feel the shock of what's about to happen, and then still shock you even more when it happens.<br/><br/>This film will be divisive. I have no doubt that many people here will hate this. However, while this is a challenging film, it's also a great film. Halfway through a character says something along the lines of \"That was so messed up, but I'm trying to keep an open mind.\" I suggest that audiences take this advice.<br/><br/>PSA, this movie is extremely violent, bloody, and gory. It's pretty horrifying and it could have stuff that is triggering.",
    "I can believe this movie will be a serious disappointment for a person, who is used to and likes to watch Hollywood war movies. Four reasons: 1. It's made in a world, where movie makers tries to have some personality. If you think 'When We Were Soldiers'... well, there are hundreds of directors who you can imagine making a similar war movie with personality and values of a hamburger.<br/><br/>2. Screenplay has a different structure. There's no shocking opening scene like in 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie starts slowly in a very nice place and ends slowly in a very bad place, without hope or feeling that the characters have achieved something by their heroic actions.<br/><br/>3. It is first a movie about lost causes in the world of war, and only secondly a war movie which takes place in Stalingrad.<br/><br/>4. War scenes portray the horror, insecurity and confusion of a battle, instead of how cool, heroic and exciting fighting looks like. In this sense, this movie is closer to reality than most of the war movies you will ever see. 'Thin Red Line' also had similar \"I would probably crap in my pants in that situation\"-feeling.<br/><br/>Stalingrad, whether you think it as a movie or a war movie has so many good things in it... like honesty. Even the ordinary German soldiers were dreaming about farms in Russia when they were advancing. What a disappointment they must have had in Stalingrad! If you like to watch war movies, meaning also other war movies than When We Were Soldiers or Saving Private Ryan, you should see this one. (9/10)",
    "I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like \"Mr. Woodcock\" and \"Good Luck Chuck,\" movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.<br/><br/>\"Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!\" <br/><br/>\"He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!\" <br/><br/>No. Die.<br/><br/>Knocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with. Needless to say, he's the reason the movie works.",
    "I've watched this film for the third time in a few years last night. Instead of writing a straight review, I'd like to jot down ten thoughts just off the top of my head concerning this exquisite movie: <br/><br/>1) Watching this film will change forever your perception of the bank heist genre, making you question the contrived cinematic conventions these films usually make use of.<br/><br/>2) The source of this film's paradoxical and/or farcical elements spring from life itself, not from film or pre-existing cinematic conventions. Sometimes, the absurdities of life are so great, they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point, this film captures that concept beautifully. <br/><br/>3) Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time, even, in hardly making an issue out of it at all - it just IS. <br/><br/>4) It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober, you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.<br/><br/>5) Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero, with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash, bloated, childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.<br/><br/>6) Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. **SPOILERS**: Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car, where he doesn't say a word, but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie; you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live! <br/><br/>7) Watching this film, you'll realise that firing a gun-shot is a BIG DEAL in real life, and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way. <br/><br/>8) All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move away you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way. <br/><br/>9) No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness, inspiration and talent. <br/><br/>10) Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive film-making as it did first time round.",
    "I'm finding it hard to see why this film has taken such a tongue lashing (or keyboard lashing) by some people...<br/><br/>mostly it is said that the main character is selfish and self indulgent, and that this film builds him up to be some kind of hero..<br/><br/>but I think that's missing the point...<br/><br/>through-out I was thinking about how, on one hand it was admirable that he wanted to break from the materialistic, money grabbing oppressive shackles placed on us by modern society, but on the other, how he had gone about it in such an irresponsible, hurtful and self-righteous way...<br/><br/>the way he abandoned his parents and loving sister without a phone call note or explanation, and from the people he met along the way, like the kind old man and young romance, especially compounded this...<br/><br/>and ultimately he realised this at the end by scribbling into a book, \"happiness only real when shared\" surely that is the lesson here! that his selfish, hurtful adolescent behaviour was wrong, and he ultimately paid a terrible cost.<br/><br/>So ignore that haters...they are looking at this story the wrong way! Very much worth an open minded viewing!",
    "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \"Scarface\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \"American Dream\".<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about the \"cheesiness\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.<br/><br/>This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.<br/><br/>The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.<br/><br/>Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \"Scarface\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",
    "Because I lived in Sierra Leone, in fact in Kono, the diamond-mining area of the country, for three years, I had to see Blood Diamond as soon as it came out. It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio's performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I've ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. This movie just gets so many things right that the few places it departs from reality are entirely forgivable. I would heartily recommend this movie to everyone; it is the best Hollywood movie I've seen in years.",
    "I found myself really enjoying SULTAN. Ali knows how to push all the right buttons to keep the audience engaged. Ali's writing and directing are flawless. This is without a doubt Ali's best ever movie. Nushki is an acting diva and she is making her way to be the next great actress since Aishwarya Rai. I love love love Nushki, I truly adore her and always will. She's my love ;) xxx I must confess that I could watch Nushki in almost anything, but here she really delivers a performance that may be her best yet . . . and I've seen almost all of her work. Nushki elevates herself to a league of her own. She is a beautiful girl who is talented enough when playing \"regular\" characters, such as the journalist in \"PK\". But as a high profile corporate executive in \"NH10\" and in this film as a musclebound wrestler, she takes it to a level most female actors couldn't. You can tell how hard she worked to make this role believable because when she wrestles you forget it is Anushka Sharma in the ring. SK is always a pleasure to watch. Here his character's sizzling chemistry with Nushki is completely adorable and that moments of sweetness will surely MELT your heart. SK gives an incredible performance that will undoubtedly propel his career. Overall it is one motion picture that should never be missed nor put aside when selecting movies to be seen on a weekend. SULTAN is a sure winner for all.",
    "`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.<br/><br/>And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.<br/><br/>Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.<br/><br/>The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.<br/><br/>O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",
    "This film is the equivalent to a sixteen year old, fairly privileged middle class boy, who has a baseball cap, curtains and t-shirt with the marijuana leaf on it yet has only ever smoked one spliff and made a huge deal about it. He thinks that smoking weed makes him relevant. So he needs to let everyone know he does it because there's nothing else that will appeal about him. Because he doesn't want to come off as a nerd, he lowers his intelligence and because he is too 'dumb' to actually be funny, he swears every 10 seconds to constitute humour. Possibly still faps over that one single poster of a tanned girl in a bikini that his Uncle bought him on his birthday because he was 'becoming a man, bro.'<br/><br/>It was described to my boyfriend as 'offensive'. It wasn't. It's vulgar. It's not even the funny kind.<br/><br/>I watched it last night with my boyfriend. Only us and a group of three 'lads' were in the cinema. Understand, we all laughed more during the adverts and trailers than we did the actual movie.<br/><br/>Within the first five minutes, I was embarrassed that I subjected my boyfriend and I to this and knew it was going to disappoint me.<br/><br/>Immediately, you're met with profanity. Now, once or twice to give the impression that hot dogs swear is fine. Swearing so much to substitute for lack of humour is just pathetic. Amidst the language, nothing funny was said. That's bad writing.<br/><br/>There's the joke that hot dogs are having sex with buns when they're put into the buns. That makes sense as a joke. It's a safe bet. This would have been modestly funny had it not been repeated throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Yes, we get it. The sausage is a phallic shape and goes into a bun.<br/><br/>It really puts it to you within the first few minutes. A pack of sausages shaming each other about their size and shape. (BECAUSE THEY ARE METAPHORICAL PENISES DON'T YOU KNOW! HAR HAR!) Again though, not funny or clever. Then courting the lady-buns by being vulgar. Sausage calls bun a b***h.<br/><br/>It was clear that I'd sat us down for an uninspired and lazy flop.<br/><br/>I laughed modestly twice. I laughed out of obligation and embarrassment about 5 times.<br/><br/>There were a few clever bits. I am a fan of wordplay, so to see someone riding a bottle of 'Horseradish Sauce' was satisfying. The Frankfurters were played as Nazis who hated 'Juice' and their symbol was 'ff', made to look the Nazi alternative. Offensive, yes, but a little clever. I like offensive humour.<br/><br/>There were so many opportunities for actual humour it hurts. Nothing that could have been funny was displayed for more than a second.<br/><br/>There was a graphic rape scene.<br/><br/>I get that it sounds ridiculous when you hear that it's a douche forcefully sucking the juice out of a carton.<br/><br/>You might think I am being silly, but I swear to you, if it had been humans, it would have been pretty horrific.<br/><br/>Because it was a cartoon, you were expected to laugh at rape.<br/><br/>Ha ha. No. I don't think any of the viewers found that funny, even the 'laddish' blokes at the back didn't crack a humoured grin.<br/><br/>There's also this really awkward sex scene at the end where all the food engage. This is to really bring home the hot-dog/penis metaphor.<br/><br/>A taco has lesbian sex with a bread roll.<br/><br/>My fingers hurt from typing.<br/><br/>If you're 12 years old and completely new to sex, drugs and swearwords, you and your dude-bros will love this.<br/><br/>If you require a little more maturity and intelligence in your humour, AVOID. Otherwise you'll leave needing to take a shower and needing to withdraw from cinema.",
    "I always thought Captain America was a corny \"golden age of comics\" superhero that had long passed his expiration date. I was shocked by how much I liked him in his first film. I was delighted to grow to like him even more in this one. They set up the character beautifully in the first movie, but he explodes as a hero here. It's hard to fault the character or this movie. Not just the MC, but the whole cast was well written and acted here. The action is well directed and tense. Battles feel much more real than most Marvel battles. There was much less obvious CGI than most films in the franchise, and it pays off. This is one of the best Marvel films to date. Lightning in a bottle. A highlight in the MCU.",
    "Over the years Akshay Kumar's choice of selecting the films has certainly improved with significant examples being Holiday, Baby, Special Chabbis, Gabbar Is Back to name few. Move over commercial masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single blow and typical song-dance routine – Raja Menon's Airlift will give you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitement.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Airlift speaks about the Ranjit Katyal (played by Akshay Kumar) who helps the Indian Government collaborate with Air India to help evacuate 1,70,000 Indians from Kuwait after Iraq raided the country.<br/><br/>From the director of critical acclaimed films like Bas Yun Hi and Barah Aana, Raja Menon does a fantastic research about the feat that was even recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record and surprisingly people are unaware about it. Airlift will consume you right from the beginning especially when Akshay's family faces the issue of Iraqi raiding Kuwait. From here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. The music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. The soulful number such as 'Soch Na Sake' is already a superhit among the viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.<br/><br/>It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. After giving back-to-back hits in 2015 with Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Singh Is Bliing, Akshay Kumar is definitely on a roll. With Holiday, Baby and now Airlift, Akshay Kumar has managed to create a image of \"Mera Bharat Mahaan\" actor and fans will love him in new avatar. The fresh pairing of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur works well. Nimrat Kaur's realistic subtlety would harness Akshay Kumar's machismo and give us that perfect thriller<br/><br/>Overall , Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4.5/5",
    "«We didn't need dialogs, we had faces» said the narcissistic Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in Billy Wilder' \"Sunset Boulevard\", referring to the Silent Era, when she used to be big  before the 'pictures got small'.<br/><br/>The reason of this introduction is that after watching Michel Hazanavicius' critically acclaimed: \"The Artist\", I strongly felt this was the perfect illustration to Norma Desmond's iconic eulogy. From beginning to end, my eyes never ceased to be amazed by the communicative smile of Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, the aging silent movie star and the sparkling eyes of Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, the young and flamboyant starlet. Their faces occupy the screen with such an electrifying magnetism that they don't just steal the scenes, they steal the dialogs  literally.<br/><br/>I was awestruck by Dujardin's performance. To those who didn't grew up with French TV programs, he's one of the most popular and talented comedians of his generation. Dujardin created the character of Brice de Nice, a blonde surfer whose specialty was to 'diss people', but it was so funny it never sounded mean-spirited. He was a member of a cult comic-troop (who made sketches à la SNL) but even back then, he had a little something that made him special: a voice, a smile, a charisma in both TV and movies, in both dramatic and comedic register. There was no doubt in France that the guy who was famous for his impressions of Robert De Niro and the camel (and even De Niro doing the camel) was promised to a brilliant career.<br/><br/>Look closely at Jean Dujardin's face, it's like drawn with 'classic' features: the finely traced mustache who builds a Fairbanks-like charisma like the strength from Samson's hair, the dazzling smile making him look like the lost son of Gene Kelly, and a certain macho toughness reminding of a young Sean Connery. Dujardin's face is a gift from cinematic Gods, and \"The Artist\" finally lets it glide, earning him the Cannes Festival Award for Best Actor. I sincerely believe he deserves an Oscar nomination, because he just doesn't play an actor from the Silent Era, he embodies the Era with the same level of demented craziness as Norma Desmond, in a brighter and more light-hearted side.<br/><br/>Valentin's self-absorption echoes Desmond's cynical ego while his gaudy 'Don Lockwood' mask (Gene Kelly in \"Singin' in the Rain\") hides the more poignant face of his insecurity. He's the star of the screen because only the screen allows him to express his unique talent. While Lockwood had to adapt to the 'talking' revolution, George Valentin makes a conservative U Turn starting an inexorable descent into madness, from an outcast, to a has-been until being finally alienated by his own talkie-phobia. The direction is so clever that it challenges many times our perceptions, creating unexpected feelings of discomfort when real sounds are heard. But I was surprised to see how much it worked on a dramatic level.<br/><br/>And this is the strength of the film, although I expect it to discomfort some viewers: it isn't a tribute in the literary meaning of the word. It has its moments where it tricks us into the use of sounds or dialogs, but never fails to distract us from the core of the story: the romance. Very quickly, we forget about spotting the hints, the references to silent classics: chase scenes, over-the-top comical gesticulations, slapstick jokes etc. This mindset would disappoint those who expected a film with the same material as Mel Brook's \"Silent Movie\", which was clearly a tribute. \"The Artist\" IS a silent movie, featuring a beautiful romance between George and Peppy, who got her break with an idea from George, something that would make her different from the other actresses: a beauty spot above the upper lip. A clever credit-billing montage depicts her consequent ascension to stardom until she finally dethrones George and makes a has-been out of him.<br/><br/>If I mentioned the performance of Dujardin, Berenice Bejo also deserves some accolades because she succeeded in looking so \"old\" from our POV yet so fresh and modern in the film, with the appealing feel-good and optimistic attitude she constantly brings on screen. With her doll-face and youngish smile, she's like a cute little girl enjoying what she does. In a way, Peppy Miller embodies the film's most inspirational element: a positive message about passion and enjoyment. And this indirectly highlights George's source of troubles: being deprived from what he enjoyed the most and suffering from his progressive fading into oblivion. Along with this conflict, the evolution of George and Peppy's romance never feels forced, quite an accomplishment when we consider how slightly over-the-top silent movie stars used to act.<br/><br/>Both Dujardin and Bejo are indeed powerful in an Oscar-worthy level and at that moment, I can't continue without mentioning the third character of the film, George's dog. The relationship between George and the dog provides a sort of Chaplinesque feel to the movie, a mix of tenderness and poignancy, so natural and convincing I wonder if the Academy will think of a honorary Oscar. Anyway, I applaud Hazanivicius for not having reduced \"The Artist\" to a flashy spectacle with no substance, with the word 'homage' as the director's convenient alibi, and make a touching romance about two people who met each other at a pivotal time in the history of film-making, each representing a side of cinema, the old-school silent generation: Chaplin, Keaton, Pickford and the exuberant talkers: Grant, Hepburn, Davis  And I'm glad he found the true note to reconcile between these two universes at the end  didn't I tell you Dujardin was the lost son of Gene Kelly?<br/><br/>\"The Artist\" plays like a missing link between \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" and it's indeed one of the best films of 2011, with the absence of words as an endearing 'beauty spot'.",
    "Opening up with the shooting of Aldos Snow's latest music video and then showing his downward spiral that leads to present day was the hilarious, perfect beginning for this innovative comedic spin-off. If you saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' then this is exactly what you would expect a movie about Aldos Snow to be like. This movie has a heart that I did not expect to see, it's buried under lewd, vulgar and brilliant wit, but it's in there.<br/><br/>Russell Brand just opens his mouth and his words are comedic gold. Jonah Hill takes a step out of his comfort zone, a bit, and plays a \"no confidence good guy\". (Usually he's the overconfident prick, for all you naysayers). Diddy delivers a surprisingly strong performance that I'm sure shocked anyone who sees him. He's actually hilarious! His repartee with everyone he comes into contact with is spot-on. The entire cast has hilarious one-liners and the two main characters really make this movie a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The plot is actually a creative one, something we don't see a lot of nowadays. Albeit the humor treads into \"familiar gross-out\" jokes, there are clever jokes too. But it's all you have to expect when following \"Rock and Roll personified\". Another point I was surprised by was that a lot... a lot of the scenes from the trailers were not in the movie. I thought that was a good and bad thing. Good because it didn't show us stuff we've already seen and gave us the chance to see new stuff. But bad because a few of the scenes were real funny.<br/><br/>For the critics who are hating this movie: Do you like comedy? Do you like Apatow's stuff? Do you like Russell Brand or Jonah Hill? If the answer is no to any 2 of these... why are you reviewing this movie? Your opinion is pointless for the people that actually DO like these movies.",
    "I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action, suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about. This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is one amazing movie.",
    "An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.<br/><br/>Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.<br/><br/>Many details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation, but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However, a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here, hence, though the story moves quickly enough, there is always the feeling that for an action-thriller, there aren't enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren't exciting or grand enough.<br/><br/>But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence didn't do as well here as in the last film, probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog, his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.<br/><br/>Emotionally, this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it's partly because I know what is coming, but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it's because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions - nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.<br/><br/>It is still a movie that can be enjoyed though, and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don't feel for the characters, you won't care about the film.",
    "I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world. <br/><br/>For starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. <br/><br/>The creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. <br/><br/>However there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. <br/><br/>Still these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn't flawless by any means it's certainly entertaining!",
    "We are all familiar with the story and with Steven Hawking. His groundbreaking work 'A brief History of Time' and devastating disabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness and immortal fame.<br/><br/>But few of us could understand the complexities of his personal life and the shocking divorce in 1990 from his long sacrificing wife of more than 25 years. Indeed that episode served to darken his reputation in the minds of many, including myself, who felt ill at ease with anyone who could leave a partner who had done so much for him just at the long awaited moment when international fame and recognition finally arrived.<br/><br/>This wonderful production, so well scripted and paced throughout, serves to explain that vital anomaly in Hawking's life. And it is made all the more poignant as it is based upon the account written by his wife who has borne so much.<br/><br/>But it is the breathtaking performance of Eddie Redmayne as Hawking that simply blasted this film into an extraordinary level. It is difficult enough to mimic so famous a person as Hawking and it is even more difficult to portray so accurately the debilitating and gradually increasing effects of Motor Neuron Disease. But to transmit so clearly the profound emotions and inner suffering that Hawking must have experienced in his agonizing journey was a performance that left me quite speechless and at times in uncontrollable tears.<br/><br/>It would be a travesty of the industry if Eddie Redmayne is not nominated for an Oscar after this performance. And to my mind it was a work of art that simply cannot be equaled let alone beaten.<br/><br/>Have a good handkerchief ready to hand.",
    "Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?  If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.<br/><br/>There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).<br/><br/>In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.<br/><br/>As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",
    "(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was \"dazed and exhausted\" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)<br/><br/>Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'.  So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being \"wowed\" by each frame visually.  How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life?  \"Heck\" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...).  Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!).  But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color.  No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story.  But, I'm glad to say, it's not!  A Bug's Life has real heart.   Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!  Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think!  Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has.  This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing.  The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots.  Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not \"dumbing down\" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.  All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point.  Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?",
    "While book racks are brimming with thought provoking, high concept science fiction, the movie genre tends to be populated by invading aliens, intergalactic wars, and adventure, which makes Director and co-writer Duncan Jones' Moon that much more of an oddity.<br/><br/>Not since Steven Soderbergh's much overlooked 2002 rendition of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris has a movie firmly rooted in the sci-fi realm delivered reflections on the human condition, which Moon does deftly.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only inhabitant of an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from lunar rocks to be shipped back to Earth to fuel the energy starved planet.<br/><br/>Sam's isolated three year posting is about to come to an end and he longs to return to Earth to see his wife. His only company throughout this sojourn has been that of Gerty, the base's HAL-like robot voiced by Kevin Spacey. Unfortunately, the final weeks and days are proving to be the most difficult, and Sam finds himself going a bit squirrelly, leaving both he and the audience to wonder if what's unfolding is actually happening, or merely a drama taking place in his addled mind.<br/><br/>That's about as much plot detail as I'm going to deliver, for to delve any deeper into the story would give too much away. Be prepared, however, for a thought provoking narrative that touches on issues such as scientific ethics, corporate greed, human identity, and compassion.<br/><br/>There are no aliens, lasers/phasers, wormholes, warp engines or jump drives here, just a lonely space age concierge, an unflappable monotone robot, and a whole lot of fodder for your brain to chow down on.<br/><br/>This is what science fiction was meant to be.",
    "\"Absolutely magnificent, Dhoni,finishes off in-style, A magnificent stroke into the crowd! India lift the world cup, After 28 years , The party started in the dressing room. and, Its an Indian captain who's been absolutely magnificent in the night of the final.\" Pretty much one of the best moments of the movie. Massive goosebumps. Ms Dhoni The Untold Story - Is a fantastically made movie which is like two sides of the same coin. The first half which shows why Neeraj Pandey is one of the best directors in the country. While the second half shows why Neeraj Pandey should never make a love story. The movie's main strength is clearly Sushant Singh Rajput who shines in every scene. He has captured the essence of the calm and composed Dhoni and portrayed it brilliantly. The first of the movie is stunning, brilliantly acted, poor special effects with some great dialogues and excellent direction by Neeraj Pandey. The cricketing aspect of Dhoni is so well done. It shows that there is always a team behind a person who is successful. An ode to friendship, struggles, responsibility, compromise and facing life regardless of the unexpected turns and twists. I was in awe how well connected the movie was. Moving from one point to another so effortlessly. Neeraj Pandey's best hour in cinema. The second half starts of well but the two love stories really bring down the movie. The Actresses are likable and all. WTF Neeraj Pandey but the movie moved at a steady pace nevertheless. It was like living the past. The famous India-Pakistan series where Dhoni shines. A lot of moments. It was like a Pleasant flashback. The performances in the movie are brilliant. Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni. What a performance! Not his best, I feel Kai Po Che was better. He was seamless, cool, composed, confident. Just like MSD. He breaks down in one scene. Which was brilliant. The Supporting Star Cast is brilliant.Every Actor in the supporting role. FANTASTIC!!! They are a lot of them. Everyone was brilliant. The actresses were strictly average. The music was decent. The movie is a solid 8-8.5/10. The love angles and the bad special effects in the first half are the only things which could have been improved. You'll love it if you loved cricket. You'll like it if you love good cinema.",
    "This movie is everything I love about movies. It's got great acting, great characters, great story, great dialogue. It's nothing short of amazing. <br/><br/>I haven't seen Farrell in a roll like this before, but he certainly shines. Going from being a brat, to coked up as all hell, to depressed in a matter of minutes and it's hilarious as well as heart breaking.<br/><br/>Gleeson is fantastic in his role too! He plays a perfect mix of cold and calculating, still being sophisticated and also has a conscience of sorts.<br/><br/>Every scene in this movie develops either character or story, and the story unfolds so flawlessly with every passing scene. Going from thinking Ray is just being an arrogant brat to realizing what he has done and why he's acting like he is is a truly fascinating journey, and you can't quite tell whether to laugh or be upset by it, sometimes doing a bit of both at once.<br/><br/>The dialogues and delivery are truly perfect, and it leaves us with so many quotable lines about topics from saving someone you were going to kill from suicide and having a discussion with him about it afterwards to race wars with midgets. Sorry, \"Dwarves\". <br/><br/>The wife telling Harry to bring \"the fellas\" as he leaves and him apologizing for calling her an inanimate object because he was upset brings so much depth to characters and their relationship only from a minute-long scene. True magic with regards to acting and dialogue. This is why dialogue and acting is so important. It brings us closer to the person behind the character and gives the story immensely more depth and excitement.<br/><br/>A cinematic masterpiece!",
    "I teach a college course on WWII, in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. This film comes out on top, perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the Belorussian \"Come and See\" & \"Schindler's List\" are darn close as well).<br/><br/>I had the remarkable experience of watching this film last night with two veterans, one a GI who fought from Omaha to Czechoslovakia. . .and a German infantry officer, a veteran of four years on the Eastern Front. The German, who met Hitler several times, within minutes was exclaiming over the historical accuracy, right down to \"Hitler's\" lower class Munich accent. . .something an American audience would never pick up on. My German friend, who at the end of the war was in East Prussia, in the debacle of attempting to evacuate over a million civilians ahead of the Russians, was profoundly shaken by the film. . .saying the horror, the hospital scenes, the utter chaos, the lynchings, the sight of 12 year old children fighting. . .all of it was real. And an interesting observation by him. . .he had no idea Berlin, at the end, had been as bad as what he witnessed along the Baltic coast and is still haunted by. It truly was \"Gotterdammerung\" for an entire nation and this film brings it frightfully close to you. If you are a parent of small children, the terrifying ending for the Goebbel's children is an absolutely searing nightmare.<br/><br/>I think the most important point of the film was the portrayal of Hitler. . .not as the stereotyped raving madman, usually overplayed like a bad performance of King Richard, but far more subtle. I've talked with many who knew Hitler, including a childhood playmate of Helga, Goebbel's oldest child, and all will tell you that Hitler could be absolutely charming, focused on you, even courtly when with women. The terror is, that even as the actor shows us that \"human\" side, in his soft voice he is dictating orders, observations, and comments of absolute evil. The true form of evil rarely looks evil on the surface, it seduces us with a fair face as it leads, sometimes an entire nation, into damnation. THis film captured that evil.<br/><br/>My German friend's comment at the end of the movie. . .\"I still can not believe we fought for that monster for six years.\" <br/><br/>A history professor at Montreat College",
    "You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",
    "Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of \"otherness\" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. <br/><br/>Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience. <br/><br/>Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",
    "I thought \"The Island\" was fantastic and just was a movie worth watching. Ewan and Scarlett were just great together in this on the seat thriller, the story was just very exciting. Especially since cloning is such a huge debate right now, I know that it is going to get more intense in the future. That's the story's main plot, cloning and wither it's right or wrong of playing God.<br/><br/>The story itself just keeps you guessing and thinking with some very great effects. I would without a doubt recommend \"The Island\" for your viewing pleasure. It's a lot of fun, it's got excitement, romance, action, and a plot that actually worked coming from Michael Bay. :D My only complaint is the ending, which I choose not to give away, but it leaves some room for questioning. Other than that, enjoy! <br/><br/>9/10",
    "This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.<br/><br/>It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. <br/><br/>Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.<br/><br/>We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. <br/><br/>But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.<br/><br/>It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10.",
    "A retired CIA operative, hunted by his own people, reunites his old team for one last mission. It's certainly not an original story, mashing together ideas that we've seen before in the Bourne series, The Expendibles and The Losers. 'RED' (which stands for 'Retired, Extremely Dangerous') is the 4th film this year to be adapted from a graphic novel. It is also the 4th to feature men going on a mission, and the 5th with a plot involving the CIA. I couldn't help but feel skeptical. But then I noticed the cast list and realised that this is meant to be a comedy. At this point I saw the project in a different light. 'RED' is a film in which John McClane, God, Cyrus the Virus and The Queen join forces and kill people for laughs. Clearly this was going to be a film where story and sense came second to cast and chemistry. <br/><br/>From 'Die Hard' to 'Sin City', Bruce Willis' good-guy-having-a-bad-day routine has evolved little, but it does not need to be fixed. His performance in 'RED' is familiar, but he is never less than entertaining. This time he brings with him an air of self-parody. Throughout the film he maintains a carefree poker-face, as though he's done this so many times over the years that he can afford to be relaxed. There are valid attempts at making Willis seem more normal, and these can be quite amusing. The first 10 minutes, which show him adjusting to retirement and aimlessly wandering around the house in his dressing gown, are reminiscent of Carl Fredricksen's first appearance as an old man in 'Up'. Deeper characterisation, however, only serves to show how abnormal he really is, and it is a delight to see him in action.<br/><br/>With the exception of Willis, the cast is made up of actors who have no business waving guns around. Helen Mirren was an inspired choice, as if making up for the predictability of Willis' casting. Flower-arranging OAP on the outside and bad-ass hit-woman on the inside, Mirren is strangely suited to action. There is something about the juxtaposition of her gran-like demeanour with exaggerated violence that makes her very funny and extremely watchable. <br/><br/>John Malkovich is particularly entertaining in his performance as a mentally questionable conspiracy theorist who refuses to retire peacefully. After the numerous roles he has played with an undercurrent of insanity, it is hilarious to see him go full-on howling mad. It is not often that Malkovich gets to flex his comedy muscles, but he steals every scene in which he appears.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is unfortunately the weakest part of this alternative A-Team, not because of his performance but because he is under-utilised. He has little action time and even less characterisation. There is a glimpse at pervy-old-man behaviour (which could have been funny) and a mention of health problems (which could have been touching) but these are quickly forgotten. It is as though the writers were distracted, trying too hard to develop a secondary storyline involving Willis' romance with a pension office clerk. This subplot adds little and distracts from the main picture. It is a pity, because the wasted effort could have been more effectively put into making the story tighter, or on giving Morgan Freeman more screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good laugh, even if you won't remember it afterwards. Taking things less seriously and trying less hard to be cool means that 'RED' is more fun than 'The Expendibles', and less embarrassing too. Stallone can mumble all he wants about \"shooting real action\" - I'd rather see the Queen fire machine guns.",
    "A great story of friendship and survival where an animal escapes from the zoo and his friends go to pick it up but everything goes wrong. The plot and their misadventures are quite original and the whole thing is rendered very well and generates great fun",
    "I just watched this movie last night for the first time. I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.<br/><br/>The movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.<br/><br/>I feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.<br/><br/>If I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it. It's too late now - I can't get it out of my head. I don't think I've ever been affected this much by a movie.",
    "What's interesting to me is the deeper meaning and symbols of the film. The film is really about two women. Sarah, and her friend, Juno. The film opens with Sarah losing both her husband and child in a horrific wreck. Over the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that the accident was caused because the husband was distracted and upset over an affair he was having with Juno. Sarah is aware, at least subconsciously, of Juno's betrayal and that it lead to the deaths of her husband and child. She is not in a place mentally or emotionally to acknowledge it on a conscious level. When Sarah awakens from the wreck, there is a sequence where she runs from darkness. The darkness symbolizes a call to action. Sarah rejects it by running from it. She isn't ready yet. This is classically what chase dreams are about. The dreamer is being pursued by their subconscious given horrible form. If the dreamer can make a conscious effort to stop running and speak to the scary thing chasing them, that dreamer's unconscious will speak directly to the dreamer. This would be the conscious (dreamer) dropping the ego defense (running) and interacting with the subconscious (chaser) to gain new insight.<br/><br/>A year passes and Juno get all the friends together to go spelunking. She lies and takes them to a cave she has discovered because she wants Sarah and her to be the ones who find the cave complex and name it. In Juno's sick mind, she's trying to perform some type of penance. She doesn't see that she's manipulating her friends to do something incredibly dangerous. Juno is a manipulator who only sees things from her own narcissistic point of view. Other people are only as real as Juno feels about them.<br/><br/>Going underground is dream imagery for going into the subconscious. This could be going into a basement under a bar as in Fight Club or even underwater.<br/><br/>Sarah is returning to the darkness that she ran from earlier. She starts to experience hallucinations (waking dreams) mainly her daughter's laugh. Her subconscious is pulling her back to the event that damaged her psyche (the wreck).<br/><br/>They get trapped and so must go deeper into the cave to find a way out. Thus Sarah is going deeper and deeper into her subconscious. It's not readily apparent but it's when they get to the deepest point of the caves (the deepest level of consciousness) that they actually encounter the cave people. If you watch you'll notice that they stop traveling downward (they may fall or are be pushed downward but the never choose to go down). Thus the cave people are the most base and ancient level of Sarah's mind. They lack all their senses. They have no problem-solving or tool-using skills but they are very strong and aggressive. They are a primal force.<br/><br/>While down with these creatures, several key events happen. The first is that Juno and Sarah's friends began to be picked off. The second is Juno's true character is revealed. She stabs one of her friends (accident) but then leaves rather then helps her (because of shock but on purpose). What's interesting is that as soon as Juno reunites with the main group, she makes a big show about she won't leave without Sarah who is missing. She acts differently when people are around. Character is what you do when others aren't watching. Juno is a person of weak character.<br/><br/>The biggest key event is that Sarah is separated from the group and ends up in the den of the cave dwellers. The heart of this lowest level of her subconscious. It is here that Juno's original betrayal becomes fully known to Sarah's conscious self. The friend that Juno stabbed is bleeding to death and tells Sarah of Juno and her husband. It's at this lowest level that Sarah understands Juno. Juno is the type of woman that would wreck the marriage of a good friend, stab a friend and leave them to die alone, and lead all her friends to certain death because of an ego trip. In short, Juno is a destructive force. Sarah kills her hurt friend to end her suffering. This is the action that Juno refused. Sarah empathized with her friend and refused to leave her in pain to make her escape. Juno did not do this. Juno felt that her feelings and safety were more important than her friend's suffering.<br/><br/>The other event that happens in this room, is that Sarah kills a cave dweller child and observes it's mother grieving over the loss. Sarah has now committed the same sin as Juno. The mother tries to kill Sarah. This is what is missing from Sarah's life. Sarah needs to take vengeance on Juno to become whole.<br/><br/>Sarah eventually meets up with Juno again and they began to make their way out as the last two survivors. After the last big fight against the cave dwellers, Sarah confronts Juno about her lies, manipulations, and betrayals. Then, Sarah stabs Juno in the leg and leaves her for the cave dwellers. This the same action Juno took earlier when she stabbed her friend and left her. What is different is that Sarah makes a conscious choice to kill Juno and takes responsibility for the action where Juno avoids the responsibility of everything she has done.<br/><br/>Then there is a long sequence where Sarah is climbing upward out of the dark to the light. This is symbolic of a return to consciousness and the real world.<br/><br/>This movie has parallels with Hamlet. What is missing from Sarah is what was missing from Hamlet. They both need to take action but because of the horribleness of the action they must take, they have recoiled from it and spend the whole story getting to a point where they come to terms with what they must do to be whole.",
    "Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.<br/><br/>Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).<br/><br/>The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.<br/><br/>The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.<br/><br/>What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!",
    "It takes a while for your eyes to get used to the uncanny animation, but once you overcome the ordeal, Beowulf turns into an outrageously entertaining ride. The performances are solid, the visuals are unique, the score is uplifting, and it has great action sequences. It's really good fun for adults of all ages.",
    "You've often heard the sales pitch, \"adults will love it, too!\" almost always referring to a kids' movie and in particularly, an animated movie for children. Well, in this case I agree. Even as a middle-aged adult, I enjoyed this.<br/><br/>The dialog is adult-friendly but at the same time not coarse or crude with no sexual innuendos, no profanity or even a hint of it. Yet, it's hip with some very clever lines.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and offers a few unique twists. David Spade does a fabulous job narrating, has a very pleasing voice, one that's fun to hear. I actually do think adults would like this more than children.",
    "I was very skeptical about this movie from the very beginning, because I thought that this would probably be a dumb monster movie with a similar theme like \"Beauty and the Beast\". However, I was very surprised when I saw the movie and think that it was brilliant!<br/><br/>After reading the reviews on this site, it is my understanding that many people that saw this move completely misunderstood it, both the people that loved it and the ones who hated it. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie is not something similar to Beauty and the Beast for those who might think that! <br/><br/>There are several themes in this movie, but the overall theme is about minorities and how privileged people view those who are different. However to make this message more clear the movie is set in the 1960's, where minorities were generally marginalized. <br/><br/>The lead character Elisa Esposito is a mute woman, who was an orphaned child that was found in a river with wounds on her neck and communicates through sign language. She works in a government laboratory as a cleaning lady. Her friends are her co-worker Zelda, a black woman who serves as an interpreter for Elisa, and her next-door neighbor Giles, a closeted gay man. Elisa discovers a mysterious creature in the facility and begins to bond with it. The creature is a mute humanoid amphibian that was captured in a river in South America by Strickland, who is in charge of the project to study it.<br/><br/>Elisa is the main protagonist in this story, and together with Zelda and Giles, they represent a social minority. Women, handicapped people, black people and gay people are all amongst those that were outcast by society at the time. On the other hand, there is Strickland who is the main antagonist in the story and he represents the privileged people at the time. He is a white man in a privileged position, married with children, religious, and is hostile to those who are not like him. He treats the creature hostilely, beats and abuses it, and calls it a monster.<br/><br/>When Elisa learns that Strickland plans to vivisect the creature, she hatches a plan with the help of her friends to free the creature and keeping it in a bathtub at her apartment and planning to set it free in the ocean. Elisa and the creature bond romantically and it is revealed that the creature has healing powers.<br/><br/>When the day arrives to set the creature free, Strickland arrives and shoots Elisa and the creature. The creature heals itself and kills Strickland. The creature takes Elisa and jumps into the ocean where it heals her. When the creature applies his healing touch to the scars on her neck, she starts to breathe through gills.<br/><br/>Here is the TWIST: This scene reveals that Elisa was of the same kind as the creature all along. She just had a more human like form than the creature. There are different clues throughout the film. She was found as child next to a river like the creature. She was found with the \"scars\" on her neck and they turned out to be dormant gills as the creature healed her. She was mute like the creature. She loved being in water as shown in her morning habits. She was initially attracted to the creature whereas most people would fear it. She comes from a Spanish speaking country, as her last name is Spanish whereas the creature was found in a river in South America.<br/><br/>The creature itself and Elisa represent a minority, as they are alike. The fact that the creature is different yet human like, symbolizes how privileged people viewed minorities at the time. The point of the monster is simply to symbolize how we sometimes view other people that are different from us.<br/><br/>The message of the story is this: You view other people that are different from yourself as \"monsters\" if you don't try to understand them. However, if you try to understand people who are different from yourself, then you will see that we are basically all alike even though we look different.<br/><br/>I think this movie was brilliant and very clever. Guillermo Del Toro did a great job. It is definitely a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>This is my point of view and I hope that you found this helpful.",
    "I saw a sold-out opening night screening of \"Across the Universe\" last night with a group of my friends who had really been looking forward to it. Many of them were extremely disappointed, while in the critical world, Roger Ebert and the New York Times loved it. Because the film was so highly anticipated, and a number of people have asked me how I liked it, I'm writing this review in an attempt to express why the movie is so divisive. I'm not going to talk about plot, or describe any of the numbers. If you're interested in seeing the movie, they'll be more enjoyable if they're unexpected.<br/><br/>It's a bizarre and beautiful movie musical, almost a music video at times, that uses thirty- three of The Beatles' songs and director Julie Taymor's unique visual style to illustrate both a personal love story and the overall conflict in the sixties. The movie is incredibly original and ambitious, and therefore its failings are as dramatic as its successes. Both stem from the same source: Julie Taymor's self-indulgence. That's nothing new to her movies, \"Frida\" and \"Titus\" have the same problem, but in a movie stripped of traditional narrative, it's glaringly obvious. Some songs are impeccably chosen and staged with great creativity, but others are too obvious, or thematically forced so Taymor can cram in another song and stunning visual sequence.<br/><br/>For the first half of the movie, I was frequently divided. One innovative sequence would really pull me into the style, then a forced number or awkward staging would distance me again. When an obvious, recognizable number began, I was torn between a cynical impulse to roll my eyes and an almost exhilarated impulse to laugh and applaud.<br/><br/>\"Across the Universe\" is a mess. There's no denying that. It is poorly paced and badly structured, and at times its feather-light plot and contrived or obligatory numbers become tedious. But at one point, about halfway through, I decided just to go along for the ride. I delighted in every brash, bold choice, whether it worked or not. I let the poignant moments move me, whether or not I intellectually felt that they were contrived.<br/><br/>The Beatles' music had a huge effect on me; from the fateful day that my friend accidentally copied the first three tracks of \"Revolver\" onto my computer, a love affair was born. Their songs are inexorably tied to memories beautiful and horrible scattered all over my life, and as I grow older, I'm constantly discovering new, deeper resonances in their familiar refrains. Even when the context was vague or stretched, the film's reinterpreting and revealing new facets of these songs seemed to serve as a tribute to their breadth and greatness. Taymor's damning depiction of the horrors of war, and lyrical portrait of young, idealistic love are both painfully expressive and unique, and simply took my breath away. By the film's shamelessly corny close, I realized that I had just had a genuine cinematic experience. For all the movies that I watch, that's incredibly rare.<br/><br/>In his review in the New York Times, Stephen Holden writes, \"I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you've tumbled.\" I could laughingly list this movie's flaws from now till next week, but I sort of fell in love with its sheer audacity. You might not. It's extremely naïve, and thematically simple, and you could find that endearing or irritating. You may love it, or you may hate it, but you're going to feel something. This movie will not change your life; don't expect it to. But if you let your criticism fade to the background, and abandon yourself to Taymor's passionate fervor, you may have a pretty amazing experience.",
    "A Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) in the original. Now, that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: Protect John Connor. John Connor(Edward Furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill him;The T-1000(Robert Patrick). Sarah, John, and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day, with a trailing, shape-shifting Termiantor trailing from behind.<br/><br/>This is the greatest of the Terminator trilogy. I have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that Cameron could have improved on. The move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. Schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. He isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. He is a machine. I hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.<br/><br/>The special effects are incredible beyond belief. The shape-shifting T-1000 is some of the greatest animation I have witnessed in cinema history. It absolutely blew my mind when I first experienced this visual extravaganza. The animation looked so real(remembering this was a good ten years). The movie included fast-paced action along with some clever sci-fi drama/horror. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. But the T-1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.<br/><br/>Sci-fi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. This is one of the few exceptions. The prediction of judgment day with Hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of Armageddon. The theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by The Terminator\" It's in your nature to destroy yourselves\". This brings the movie to a whole new level of sci-fi.<br/><br/>Overall, Termiantor II: Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it, buy it! Because once you have seen it, you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "I heard that this movie received negative reviews and feedback, so I was pleasantly surprised when I enJOYed the movie as much as I did.<br/><br/>There is no denying that the grand appeal to the movie was Jennifer Lawrence's compelling performance. The movie's story itself does not seem like it has much to offer. A poor, overworked woman selling a plastic mop does not sound that thrilling on paper. However, Lawrence takes it up a level to a powerful story about a woman never giving up and making her own opportunities happen against all odds. She takes you on an emotional journey from start to finish. Lawrence has the undeniable ability to make you ache along with her struggles. This can be uncomfortable for the helpless movie-goer, which leads me to wonder if this is the reason so many people had distaste for the film. No one wants to be told that hard work and strong will are not enough to succeed in this world, and, as a whole, \"Joy\" does just that. <br/><br/>That being said, \"Joy\" still left me feeling inspired. As a young, aspiration-filled woman myself, Lawrence's portrayal of Joy makes me feel like I can take on the world (which is dream that current American society consistently crushes on the daily). Lawrence's deadpan stares as she struts in and out of offices along with her turning point bathroom haircut, confirm that both Jennifer and Joy are a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>\"Joy\" also possesses a subtle humor, although many reviews seem to deny its existence. The purposefully over the top soap opera scenes obsessed over by bed-bound Terry (played by Virginia Madsen) are just enough to raise the otherwise dark tone. <br/><br/>Lawrence and David O. Russell take you on an emotional journey with \"Joy.\" It may not be the uplifting movie you want this holiday season, but I would argue it is the movie you need.",
    "It's true that you can have too much of a good thing...please no more different editions!<br/><br/>THEATRICAL CUT - was the best version of any of the \"cuts\" it was the most cleanly edited and it had the best soundtrack out of the three. It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.<br/><br/>SUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.<br/><br/>ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don't even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the \"safe room scene\". A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money.",
    "I am 31 so I was 3 when this movie came out. The first time I saw Saturday Night Fever was the \"Edited For Television\" version probably when I was 6 or 7 years old. At that point, it was about the music, the dance scenes and the clothes.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be until years later that I understood what a great story this is. It's a coming of age movie. It's a modern day tragedy. It's a love story.<br/><br/>The first thing that people think about when they hear Saturday Night Fever is disco and bell bottoms, but the story is timeless. Travolta plays Tony Manero, a loser in a nowhere job who only feels alive when he is on the dance floor at the local disco. There he is adored by his friends, by women and by strangers. There he is king. Everywhere else he is nobody. Even at home.<br/><br/>Tony becomes infatuated with a woman named Stephanie. On the surface Stephanie appears to be much better off than Tony. For the most part Stephanie is a big talker, but Tony is bothered by her observations.<br/><br/>\"Let me guess. You work all week long at some dead end job and then you go and blow it at all at 2001 (the disco) on the weekends. You're a cliché. You're no one, going nowhere.\" As much as Tony is upset by her words he can't argue with them. Soon Tony becomes frustrated with his \"station in life\" and tells Stephanie he wants out (of Brooklyn).<br/><br/>What makes Saturday Night Fever work so much for me is Tony is very typical of a lot of males who would rather have a good time and party now than build something toward the future. Bars are full of guys like Tony. Guys who are super stars in their local drinking establishments, but have no life outside of the night life.<br/><br/>And of course there's the superb dance scenes that most people remember Saturday Night Fever for. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, Saturday Night Fever also has my favorite closing shot of all time. It's really nothing special, but I get choked up every time I see it.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is also a snapshot of a period in recent American history. The movie took place in 1977. The country was a mess after the Vitenam war ended and before Reagan stormed Washington and once again instilled a sense of pride in Americans. There was no longer a war to protest, but the average American didn't have much faith in our country. I think Saturday Night Fever does an excellent job of capturing what was probably a common attitude among young adults during the late 70's. Live for the moment because the future is pretty bleak.",
    "For those who don't like documentaries (the documentary about Snowden, which is part of this movie, is excellent education about what our government can do with us) watch this first. Oliver Stone paints a portrait of a stand-up, pretty much button down guy who realizes the work he falls into is anything but what he was taught was right -- and then he needs to find a way out, without endangering his girlfriend. Another great film about a whistleblower --- and for his whistleblowing, he faces far harsher penalties just for coming home. Oliver Stone delivers thought provoking film again, and the entire cast, as well as the writing, is stellar.<br/><br/>For those who made up their mind about Ed Snowden through what was reported in mass media, I would simply say, watch this with an open mind. What happened to him could happen to any of us. This is a cautionary tale based on true facts told in the most exquisite way by Stone and his cast.<br/><br/>Isabeau Vollhardt, author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey",
    "I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.<br/><br/>At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.<br/><br/>There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",
    "***SPOILER ALERT - I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS MOVIE! ***<br/><br/>It's a shame that this film was promoted as a \"hot\" erotic thriller. Kubrick would not have allowed that marketing campaign to go forward had he been alive.  Sure there's a lot of eroticism in this movie, but those who go to it looking for sexual thrills are going to be (and were) sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>The events in this movie are triggered by the protagonist's wife's revelation that she almost slept with another man.  This kicks off a range of emotions and prompts him to re-evaluate his sexual relationship with her, subsequently leading to a trip through his sexual SUBconscious.  This is the critical point that all too many viewers miss, though it's so overtly surreal I don't see how one could miss it.  None of this is real!  It's called Eyes Wide SHUT for a reason!<br/><br/>All of our protagonists' \"encounters\" represent manifestations of his sexual fantasies and fears.  His fantasies include group sex, sex with a teenager, sex with a prostitute, sex without strings.  His fears include disease, homosexuality (notice the brutal and brief encounter with the gay-bashing gang), and most of all: discovery.  Discovery of his hidden fantasies, which might reveal his true nature to the world.  Discovery that he is really a pretender, doesn't really belong, and is not worthy after all.  This latter is probably universal, and in his case while it has sexual dimensions it is not purely sexual.  In the end he realizes that his fantasies are just fantasies, at least some of his fears are legitimate, and that instead of just fantasizing about sex he should actually have sex with his wife.  Not rocket science here, but plenty of people need reminding of this from time to time, and it's a well-told story.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to first see this movie in theaters overseas, and was spared the atrocity of digital editing to make things less explicit. David Lynch did the same thing more recently in Mulholland Drive, and I hope that this is not the beginning of a trend.  Given all of the explicit gore and brutality in movies, the level of sexual explicitness that triggers the censors is simply laughable.  Frankly, having seen the un-edited version, I didn't think it was a big deal.<br/><br/>One can't dismiss criticisms that the nudity was all female and many of the women were depicted as sexual objects, but this movie is quite pointedly a trip through a fairly conventional man's sexual unconscious and necessarily told from a male point of view.  So none of these things should be a surprise.  It would be very interesting to see a comparable exploration of the female sexual subconscious by an accomplished woman director, though I'm not holding my breath that the Hollywood establishment will allow that to happen soon.",
    "I had no idea what was going on most of the time because I'm not particularly familiar with Warcraft's story. That being said, this is a decent movie, especially considering it's a video game franchise film...90% of the time video game films are very badly adapted to the screen.",
    "Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)<br/><br/>It was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn't end there however...<br/><br/>This film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali's face, and Zahra's tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.<br/><br/>We see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali's Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.<br/><br/>There is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.<br/><br/>Later in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.<br/><br/>The film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour.  This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.<br/><br/>The film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.<br/><br/>Missing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.<br/><br/>I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Ollie",
    "Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.<br/><br/>What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (on scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation who is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The set up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it is involving, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action so much more effective, as we are so invested in the characters, for all their all too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge for its entirety, and doesn't cop out at the end either.<br/><br/>The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles, when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on-screen power these days). This film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and the quality of the film. It just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt, it ends up going straight to video. I wish I'd got the chance to see this on the big screen.",
    "I must say, no signs of aging. Embedded in its day and yet totally relevant. Perhaps the most entertaining of all of Hitchcock's films. Marriage is the theme and murder is the hook. James Stewart is as perfect as he's ever been. He uses the contradictions of his character to create someone immediately familiar. Thelma Ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. Grace Kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream. She remains a sort of dream that's why to see her climb the killer's balcony is one of my most cherished film memories. If you haven't seen the film you may think I'm rambling but if you have, you know exactly what I mean, don't you?",
    "Pier Paolo Pasolini, as is well known, was murdered not long after he finished work on this, his most audacious and confrontational film, yet even the most casual viewing of SALO begs the question - had he not been murdered, would he have taken his own life anyway? Every sequence, every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair, barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race, one gets the impression that Pasolini was barely hanging onto life - and any attendant shreds of hope - by his fingernails. Although ostensibly an adaptation of one of DeSade's most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the Second World War with the Fascist ruling classes as its (authentically vile) villains, SALO also contains a lot of contemporary criticism - Pasolini hated the modern world, and explained the stomach-churning 'banquet of s**t' as a none-too-subtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains. (The scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society - those who come to SALO expecting titillation or B-movie sleaze will be sorely disappointed.) Beyond the nihilistic content, which has been well documented elsewhere, the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washed-out, faded film stock using primarily static cameras, long shots, choppy editing and very few cutaways, SALO has a visual style reminiscent of cinema-verite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music, piano dirges and the (intentionally?) scrappy post-dubbed dialogue, and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. SALO comes across as one long primal scream of rage, designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency, and in this respect, the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once, or indeed for 'entertainment', is another matter, but SALO is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it.",
    "I had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.<br/><br/>I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.",
    "There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic that will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers, just like its predecessors by Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott. Despite the many questions I had in my mind when I left the theater and the moments during the film when I felt disappointed or confused, I knew this, and I have not stopped thinking about the movie and longing to be back in front of the screen.<br/><br/>It is easy to criticize this movie as some have done for being overly ambitious, pandering to low taste, being too simple or too complex, with too few actors or too many, or even for celebrating revenge violence against professional critics who write negative reviews. They may all be correct, but these critics will still put themselves in the same category as those that warned audiences against 2001 or Blade Runner. The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach, its visual and acoustic impact, its mesmerizing flow and its completely ground-breaking storytelling, and movie goers will see it and feel it in their guts. <br/><br/>It is a movie that is a product of our age of internet-driven universal knowledge and vision, and the freedom we have to travel the world and jump between ages, genres, images and identities at our will. It reminds us that we are human and that we can still hear our heart beat, if we listen.",
    "Some reviewers have suggested that the storyline of this movie is a bit plodding and portentous, and I'd be willing to allow that. But even if this film had absolutely no plot to speak of, I would have considered the money I plunked down yesterday to see \"Hero\" to be money well-spent, because I have been witness to some of the most achingly beautiful film-making I've ever seen. As in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but \"Crouching Tiger\" surely could have benefited from the sublime camera eye of \"Hero.\" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality. At a time when movie theaters show a lot of utter dreck, we ought to be supporting movies like this.",
    "Anyone who knows me knows my favorite band is The Beach Boys, and my favorite musician is their leader, Brian Wilson. I first got deep into their music last November when I heard their album SMiLE, an album which wasn't officially released until 45 years after its conception and recording. It was worth the wait, as I consider it the best album I've ever heard.<br/><br/>I found out that a biopic of Wilson was in the works, and would be screening at SXSW with Wilson in attendance. I knew I had to go and see this film. The experience is one that will stick with me for the rest of my life as one of the most emotionally powerful events I have been a part of.<br/><br/>Love and Mercy is the story of The Beach Boys' founder Brian Wilson. The film chronicles his rise to fame in the 1960's and the his decline into mental illness, and his escape from the control of his therapist in the 1980's.<br/><br/>Paul Dano plays Wilson in the 1960's, and John Cusack plays him in the 1980's. It also stars Elizabeth Banks as Wilson's future wife, Melinda Ledbetter, and Paul Giamatti as his therapist, Eugene Landy.<br/><br/>Paul Dano exudes the boyish look of young Wilson perfectly. He relearned how to play piano for the role, and sings much of the music in the film.<br/><br/>His performance is hard to watch at times because of how depressing it is seeing him devolve from an energetic, fun young man into a tortured, drained artist. Dano handles the role with passion and care, and his performance never feels forced or fake.<br/><br/>When Wilson begins to suffer a panic attack, anyone who's had one will feel deeply for him. When he starts to have physical symptoms of depression after years of physical and mental abuse from his father and disapproval of his musical direction from fellow band mate Mike Love, Dano portrays the hurt that comes from those events with subtle facial expressions and natural transition.<br/><br/>John Cusack looks less like Wilson physically, but his performance may be even more complex. His Wilson has been to the bottom, and he brilliantly portrays how challenging it is to rebuild your life after going through mental and physical anguish.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Banks has a great departure from her more well known comedic film roles, and as Ledbetter, she shows her strength and respect for the man she loves through actions and subtle expressions instead of overt, over the top dialog.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti has the most campy role in the film as Eugene Landy, but this is unfortunately how Landy was in real life. He was as violent and controlling over Wilson's life as the movie portrays, so his abusive, manipulative, angering performance is highly accurate.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Love and Mercy is that it doesn't exaggerate or make up events to make the film more interesting. The filmmakers trust the strength of its source material is interesting enough to make for a great story.<br/><br/>The storytelling structure of the movie is interesting and risky. The film jumps from the 60's to the 80's without warning, and it works. The slightly askew technique allows the audience to experience the downfall and uprising of Wilson's life simultaneously, and allows the movie to end on a happy note.<br/><br/>One complaint people have is that the film skips over the 1970's, Wilson's most tumultuous period in which he weighed 300 pounds and spent the majority of three years in bed, crippled by depression and drug addiction. However, this allows the audience to examine the reasons for his downfall and redemption instead of indulging in the horrible escapism Wilson turned to.<br/><br/>Beach Boys fans will appreciate the movie more than the average film-goer. Mike Love in hats, dancing, and mentioning \"the formula\"? Check. Drug tent and piano in the sandbox in Wilson's living room? Check. The infamous \"Fire\" session? Check. Everything is on point, from the scarily accurate wardrobe down to recreating the \"Sloop John B.\" and \"Surf's Up\" promo videos shot for shot. It's these moments that show the film was made by fans with an attention for detail.<br/><br/>Almost every song on the album Pet Sounds is featured in the film somewhere. Seeing Wilson's unorthodox recording techniques is such a pleasure for music nerds.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Robert Yeoman, best known for creating the look of Wes Anderson's films, blends stylistic tone with realistic camera work, creating a sense of false nostalgia that is surreal yet inviting and intense.<br/><br/>Composer Atticus Ross works wonders with the score, using a great wealth of Wilson's music in different ways and choosing songs that fit with the emotional tone of the scene brilliantly. Hearing the instrumental version of \"Don't Talk\" play as Wilson takes LSD for the first time is haunting. Witnessing the song \"Til' I Die\" play over a surreal, Kubrickian scene in which Wilson has an epiphany made me cry because of the powerful combination of imagery and music.<br/><br/>The film is being released on June 5, to capitalize on The Beach Boys music being a staple of the summer, but it feels more like a Thanksgiving release to me. The cinematography, acting, script, and score are all Oscar worthy in my opinion, but the film may get lost in the race to other contenders, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Love and Mercy is an awesome, unorthodox biopic that takes risks with form and narrative that has strong performances, script, cinematography, and of course, an amazing soundtrack. It will expose young people to the brilliance of Wilson's music and give older fans an insight into why Wilson is the poster boy for using creativity as an escape and an outlet from the pain of life and mental illness.<br/><br/>And seriously, listen to the album SMiLE.",
    "If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.",
    "With workers striking in Russia, the crew of the battleship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me  surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.<br/><br/>The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the media but also a cracking good film in its own right.",
    "Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.<br/><br/>Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to \"Christmas Town\". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.<br/><br/>People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! <br/><br/>10/10",
    "The internet is a funny place... it seems to be filled with people who have graduated with 5 Ph.Ds. and clearly seem to be smarter than everybody else (thousands of astronauts and astrophysicists on IMDb apparently). One star rating? Come on... Clearly, you haven't watched enough films to know decent from terrible.<br/><br/>I watched this film without having heard of it (no trailers, spoilers or anything). I'm a sci-fi fan and thought this was a good watch.<br/><br/>I found the characters to lack depth and their actions were questionable at times but the plot was believable and the acting decent. Special effects were good and made the movie believable in my opinion. The movie was well shot and I thought the scenes with the creature were pretty cool.<br/><br/>I don't get how people even compare this movie to \"Aliens\"; it's nothing alike. Overall, I thought it was pretty good.",
    "The cultural references of Wayne's World may date it a bit, but the nature and personality of its humor set it apart. There is a kind of naive benevolence and boundless joy which makes this movie so lovable. Its aimless plot and exaggerated humor are cute, without ever transcending that barrier into maudlin sentiment. This is a difficult mix to achieve, especially when so many comedians go out of their way to achieve \"street credibility\" through as much forced vulgarity and stereotypical humor as possible. Campbell and Carvey's characters were the ultimate comedic anti-heroes for generation X, even more so than Jay and Silent Bob, Bill and Ted, or Beavis and Butthead. They championed amateurism, paraded self-affecting humor, and became worshiped for telling everyone they weren't worthy. If '60s pop culture encouraged people to \"do your own thing,\" Wayne and Garth were the genuine article in the '90s. Two complete geeks had fun acting as themselves, and became celebrated in the process. One of the true comedy classics of our time. 8.5/10",
    "Let me confess I'm not a Catholic, I don't have children, I can't stand schmaltz and yet I love The Sound Of Music. I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: \"It makes you feel alive\" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you.",
    "I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, i was simply compelled to watch it until the end. I already knew how it ended so i was surprised it commanded my attention so intensely.<br/><br/>The fact is the characters were all so realistically portrayed and the film was so expertly directed that it was almost as if the Apollo 13 disaster was filmed and that is what i was watching.<br/><br/>Now this film is certainly not to everyone's taste, it is quite slow in the build up and the film relies almost entirely on the script and ability of the cast.<br/><br/>If you like your disaster films loud and in your face then this is probably not for you, but if you like them realistic (slightly dramatised) then watch it and be astounded.<br/><br/>9/10",
    "A true best of both worlds for classic Disney and classic Pixar fans. It had already been many years since the acquisition, but for me this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar doing Disney.",
    "Much as I admire Spike Lee's talent and audacity, this film just didn't work for me. Too many preposterous plot points while the motivations (of everyone, it seemed) were never clear. The whole thing was just confusing.<br/><br/>And yes, disjointed.",
    "Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger has experienced both. On January 15, 2009, Sully made the decision to land the crippled aircraft of US Airways flight 1549 right into a river  an event immediately labeled \"Miracle on the Hudson\".<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this is the first film collaboration for Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood. Both have cinematic experience with true life stories and real people: Hanks most recently in Captain Phillips and Bridge of Spies; and Clint with American Sniper and J. Edgar. This one is the perfect fit as Hanks takes on a good man who takes pride in doing his job, and Clint brings to life a story that showcases the best of human nature.<br/><br/>Tom Komanicki adapted the screenplay from the book \"Highest Duty\", co-written by Sully and Jeffrey Zaslow. Much of the attention is given to the doubts and uncertainty Sully experienced during the NTSB review. The scrutiny of his work by the committee (played here by the ultra-serious Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan) left his career and reputation dangling, inspiring nightmares that are much worse than yours and mine.<br/><br/>Certainly we are in awe of what Sully pulled off that morning, but as movie goers, we are anxious to see the plane crash/splash/landing. Clint comes through in breath-taking fashion. While it lacks the hysterics and drama of the upside-down plane in Flight, this re-creation is so realistic that we nearly obey the flight attendants repeated instructions of \"Heads down. Stay down\". Even the cockpit chatter, passenger evacuation, and first responder's (many of whom are real life folks, not actors) activities are played in matter-of-fact manner  more people just doing their job. We shiver knowing the icy Hudson River water is 36 degrees, and we feel Sully's anxiety as he desperately tries to get a final count  a count that he prays will hit 155.<br/><br/>Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles and has a couple of memorable scenes, and Laura Linney embraces the thankless role of telephone wife of Sully during the aftermath and hearings. We get a glimpse of Sully's background with flashbacks to his flight lessons at a Denison Texas private airfield, as well as a portion of his military service. Hanks is the perfect choice for a role that would have suited James Stewart just fine if it were the 1940's.<br/><br/>The conflict here comes from the NTSB inquiry. Backed by computer simulators that show the plane could have coasted back to LaGuardia, we get the distinct feeling that the committee's goal is finding human error – naming a scapegoat (other than Canadian geese) for their \"lost\" plane. It's Sully who reminds us that the committee is simply doing their job  just as he was, Skiles was, the Flight Attendants were, and the first responders were.<br/><br/>This is technically expert filmmaking. We know the ending, but are glued to the screen. Frequent Eastwood collaborator Tom Stern handles the cinematography, and like the acting and story-telling, the camera work avoids any excess or over-dramatization. The film provides one of the best examples ever of the duality of hero worship and intense scrutiny, and how a person can be a hero by simply doing their job. The closing credits show clips of the flight's reunion and every survivor would agree that the best among us allowed a continuation of life  something that could have gone to the other extreme.",
    "It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan's \"worst\" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. <br/><br/>Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the aestetics of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the \"comic book\" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me. <br/><br/>As for the score, I am more than willing to argue that this is, hands down, James Newton Howard's best score of his very successful career. It is compelling and booming. It's very powerful, but not over-the-top and excessive. For anyone with the soundtrack, check out 'The Orange Man' and 'Visions'. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. And I stress the word \"powerful\". Yeah, he's no Hermann or Morricone, but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling. <br/><br/>The writing and the direction are just as captivating as the score. Almost every line of dialogue and every scene seems to be placed out on an island, alone so that everyone can stop and judge it. Some people might view this as cocky and/or boring direction, but I see it as daring and unique. Much of Shyamalan's writing is done that way. ('…I see dead people…' '...They call me Mr. Glass…' etc. etc.) Another aspect of the film that tickles my fancy is the underlying themes. I do believe, to a certain extent, that people do have somewhat supernatural powers at times. People have been known to make miracles and do unbelievable things. Maybe these things could be 'developed' in some way. These theories are, in a way, intertwined with some aspects of psychology, such as selective attention and self-actualization. If you care to discuss some of these ideas, let me know and I will relate them to the film through my eyes. In short, I do believe there is a superhero in everyone. It may not be through supernatural powers, but it may simply be through the act of reaching out to a person in need. Other themes of the movie, like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing, yet universal. From a psychological point of view, Shyamalan really gets inside the head of OI patients (osteogenesis imperfecta). He then brings this psyche to the next level with Jackson's character. Elijah, is very passionate but very tortured and evil. His interactions with Willis bring depth and focus to both the characters and the story. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. The shots of Willis in his security poncho. The train station scene. Elijah's breathtaking fall on the stairs and many more speak so loudly to me and say so much in just a simple clip. For some reason this movie just speaks to me, like art. If anyone cares to discuss more about this film, that'd be cool. There is a lotta other cool stuff to talk about with this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it a few more times. It may not be the feel good film of the year, or the masterpiece that everyone was looking for, but it definitely sits well with me.",
    "Well, if I could split the movie into two, I would say that the first half is a superb Proposal and the second half is fairly traditional Hollywood pablum. In the first half, the wonderful comedic timing and chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds was terrific. The writing was first-rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put-downs. Kudos to the Director, Anne Fletcher, and the Screenwriter, Pete Chiarelli.<br/><br/>The completely different tone in the second half, I surmise, could only be attributed to the studios/producers stepping in and stating that the film must appeal to a wider audience. We, then, get lots of family characters thrown in, with a great reduction of Bullock and Reynolds mutual screen time. And when they do share time in the second half, it's more about slapstick/physical humor (cue studios/producers needing appeal to wider, a.k.a, younger audience). Maudlin music comes in on the soundtrack, letting us know that this part of the movie is supposed to tug on our heartstrings.<br/><br/>I don't buy the inevitable resolution either. I don't believe that it is supported well or justified by what came before it.<br/><br/>The 1st 45 minutes is WELL worth seeing. I wish the filmmakers could have pushed and maintained the pace and feel for the entire movie. Reynolds and Bullock are so good, they could be this generation's Tracy and Hepburn. I'd like to see them in another project that follows through all the way.<br/><br/>BTW, this film was actually shot in Boston and (the Alaska scenes) in Manchester by the Sea and Rockport on the North Shore with digital effects adding snow capped mountains. You might even recognize Motif No.1, a famous small building on a wharf in Rockport which has been the subject of many famous painters' and photographers' work. It was also fun seeing some of my local Boston area acting colleagues doing background work in the film.",
    "I was supposed to be be seeing either Flight or Argo today, but to my disappointment I missed both showtimes, and I was in a tight time frame where I could see anything. So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how \"pretty\" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. <br/><br/>Overall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it. Highly recommended.",
    "What unlikely trio to fall in love with, just as unlikely as the landscape. When a movie fits so well without a tag that links it to anything else in its historic film context, it can only be described as a happy accident. Premeditated for sure, but accident nonetheless. Terence Stamp, is an actor with a spectacular career. Varied and surprising. It defies description, but let me try. Peter Ustinov's \"Billy Budd\" William Wyler's \"The Collector\" Federico Fellini's \"Spirit of the Dead\" John Schlesinger's \"Far From The Madding Crowd\" Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"Teorema\" Joseph Losey's \"Modesty Blaise\" Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\" Stephen Frear's \"The Hit\" Richard Donner's \"Superman\" \"Steven Sodebergh's \"The Limey\" Am I making my point? He is an actor for all seasons, beautiful beyond belief to boot. In \"The Adventures of Pricilla Queen of The Desert\" he unveils another unexpected side to his considerable talents. A Woman. And what a woman, a Meryl Streep with a past and, thanks to director Stephan Elliot, with a future. Dressed by geniuses. More human than ever. He is flanked by two spectacular Aussies. Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) giving a performance of such tenderness that even my brother in law, a homophobic macho man of the first order,loved him. And Guy Pearce (L A Confidential) He is such a beautiful,sexy, funny girl that made me long for a her/he all to myself. Some other monstrously cloned movies were rushed into production trying to capitalize on the success of Pricilla. They all failed miserably and rightly so. Frank Capra, accepting his AFI Lifetime Achievement Award sent a profound and heartfelt advise to young filmmakers. \"Don't follow trends, start new ones\" Well done Mr Elliot. Well done.",
    "The movie, \"Se7en\", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.<br/><br/>The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from \"The Divine Comedy\", sets out to, \"preach\" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.<br/><br/>Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.<br/><br/>Score 10/10",
    "Army of Darkness (1992) is in my opinion by far the best one of the \"Evil Dead\" trilogy! It is my second favorite film of the trilogy, I just love, love this movie to death!!!! It is my personal favorite horror movie in the Evil Dead series. The best one is the theatrical cut the rest versions are pure crap with lameness. The original cut kicks ass!!! Great movie! This movie is so silly, that it's actually funny. <br/><br/>I have always loved Army of Darkness and I always will. I love this film to death!!!! I was watching with my dad this film and even he loved it. So yes I proud to say I love this film and I have enjoyed More than the original The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987)! This film has funny moments, balance, smart genius creativity, great babes, mystic forces and mystic knights in it.<br/><br/>Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun. <br/><br/>Army of the dead who were actually skeletons were fabulous, the fights were awesome and they and they were highly enjoyable. The film was fast paced from the beginning till the end. I am sorry if you guys love Evil Dead 2 much better than this film, I just love Army of Darkness much better, this film is just a great worthy sequel to their predecessors. Ash is like ably hero on screen and he is one of the most popular hero's till it's days. Army of Darkness is a classic. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, & the special effects masters KNB! You cant ask for more. Great story, funny lines, fantastic looking monsters. I don't care what anyone says I just love this film to death!!! <br/><br/>What we get in here is a hybrid of sorts with Bruce Campbell once again as Ash the reluctant hero fighting ghouls and goblins (well maybe not goblins) in the medieval times. This third chapter goes for more of the laughs rather then the scares and actually offers up a fun take on the genre mix director Sam Raimi tells. The movie is not as annoying as the previous 2 films and closes out the trilogy nicely. They are a lot of talks of an Army of Darkness 2 and I don't want any sequel to this horror/comedy flick. I thought this film closed the trilogy beautiful. There is a lots of comic relief, over the top cuts, BOOMSTICK!!!!! <br/><br/>Army of Darkness is my second favorite movie (Evil Dead II, Dark Knight, ARMY OF DARKNESS) and here's why. It follows the character of Ashley (Ash) J. Williams in his journey to the past that is far better explained in Evil Dead II. He is only able to be sent back to his own time (and his job at S Mart) if he finds the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) which will also free the people who can help him from the attacks of the deadites. Ash has to find the book, get the babe, fight some demons, and get back home...like in the deal. This movie has it all, and some sugar, baby! It is a hilarious, gory, wonderful display of Bruce Campbell's ingenious acting ability, and anyone who says differently is a deadite. It's a film that would make Clive Barker proud. An oddball yet absolutely successful pairing of slapstick Comedy and undead Horror with a medieval setting thrown into the mix for good measure, 1992's Army of Darkness sits proudly near the top of the list of most unconventional yet absolutely entertaining motion pictures in history. Following up on 1981's oft-banned The Evil Dead and 1987's The Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (itself a Horror-Comedy hybrid), Army of Darkness represents the most accessible and audience-friendly of the three. Special effects; gore; humor; and of course, Bruce Campbell's over-the-top antics are Awesome!!! Hail to the king, baby.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is a 1992 American dark fantasy action comedy film directed by Sam Raimi. It is the third installment of the Evil Dead franchise. The film was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell (also acting as co-producer) and Embeth Davidtz. Continuing from Evil Dead II, Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.<br/><br/>Beyond in human flesh, inked in blood-and amazingly hard to pronounce-the ancient \"Necronomicon\" (Book of the Dead) unleashes unspeakable evil upon mankind in director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic. Back to do battle with the hideous \"Deadites,\" Bruce Campbell reprises his role from the Evil Dead series as Ash, the handsome, shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk from S-Mart's housewares division. Demonic forces time warp him-and his '73 Oldsmobile-into England's Dark Ages, where he romances a beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and faces legions of undead beasts, including a ghastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the dead, rescue his girlfriend and get back to his own time? This movie is personal second favorite movie it is 10/10.",
    "Going into the theater, I was under the impression that this was a silly James Franco and Seth Rogen movie that made fun of The Room, a legendary bad movie. That's not what the Disaster Artist is at all. Instead, it celebrates The Room. It celebrates Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, their passion, and their pursuit of a dream. <br/><br/> Sure, The Disaster Artist comments on how The Room bombed terribly; it had to acknowledge this. It comments on the utter lack of acting talent that Tommy and Greg possessed; it had to acknowledge this too. But it handles these details with such delicacy and care that I never felt that it was putting down the characters. Actually, it seemed that the film admired them. Even when the world told them to quit, they never gave up on themselves or each other. The message is surprisingly inspiring. <br/><br/> The movie becomes something more than mere mockery because of the way it handles the relationship between Tommy and Greg with such care and affection. The two genuinely liked each other and saw each other in ways that no one else did. Greg certainly did not understand all of Tommy's methods and decisions, but he understood Tommy's good intentions. Establishing this buddy connection is crucial later in the movie. <br/><br/>After Tommy writes The Room and they begin filming, Tommy expresses his idiosyncrasies in full force. While the film crew sees him as a confusing weirdo, we know there's something more. Despite his utter incompetence in directing and acting and all aspects of filmmaking, we still root him. And we still root for Greg, ever the supportive friend. Tommy makes absurd and confounding choices that don't make sense to Greg and they don't make sense to anyone else either. Even one of Tommy's explanations was simply \"people do crazy things.\" Still, Greg remains loyal. <br/><br/>With as strange as Wiseau behaves, capturing his eccentricities would clearly prove challenging. Give James Franco credit for capturing Wiseau's weirdness in character without ever devolving into derisive mockery. Franco captures his gait, stiff shoulders, hunched posture, indeterminable and inconsistent accent, and his laugh. Watching The Room and hearing Tommy Wiseau laugh, I thought that it sounded completely fake. I chalked it up to another instance of poor acting. But after seeing Wiseau in interviews, I realized that it was his real laugh. To him, the laugh wasn't poor acting because that's what he thinks a genuine laugh sounds like. <br/><br/> Seeing and hearing Wiseau behaving as himself explains a lot about his behavior in The Room. He's just an interesting and very unusual guy. His acting and the acting of others in his movie is still atrocious, but it shifts from startlingly and confusingly bad to understandably bad. And more importantly, seeing the real Tommy makes his movie all the more fun. <br/><br/> You don't need to see The Room to enjoy The Disaster Artist. Would it help? Sure. Seeing The Room first makes many of the inside jokes made in The Disaster Artist funnier and gives a clearer sense of how confoundingly weird the movie truly is. Words cannot do it justice. To understand, you have to see The Room for yourself. I recommend seeing both.",
    "This film is an insult to Faith Sultan Mehmet, to Ottoman history, and to the intelligence of any audience. It is the very example of how western orientalizm can be internalized. The reason why the conquest of Constantinopolis was a matter of survival for the Turks -the economical, political reasons- were totally non existent. Mehmet II, a well educated man, is nothing more than a religious zealot in this film. Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, who is well respected by the Turks, is a caricature. <br/><br/>Suicide bombings, only a phenomenon of late 20th century, is a common theme in the film: all Ottoman soldiers behave like suicide bombers! What is this? What are they trying to imply? This is a part of the recent series of superficial films and TV shows which seem to aim de-educating Turkey, constantly attack reason, and play at Turkish people's feelings of being under attack of western contempt, orientalizm and memories of WWI defeat.<br/><br/>The side themes fail as hard as the main theme: an absurd love story, a wife with no dialogue, unexplainable motives of Urban, and so on... <br/><br/>This film is harshly criticized in Turkey. I can't imagine why it is being defended so eagerly on IMDb. Because it fails in stirring any feeling of satisfaction of national pride as well. No character study, no context, no wit, not even a propaganda, just the first depiction of the conquest with a relatively big production, a way to imagine how it was, and that's why people go to see this movie in masses. One can't deny the production of war scenes is an improvement for Turkish film industry, but unfortunately, that's all.",
    "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy's dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit & charm along with Indy's usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.<br/><br/>This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg's output: A young Indiana \"beginning\" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat \"You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it.\" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. <br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There's a bit of kissing/banter, and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. There's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy's Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it's up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
    "I attended the Cast and Crew screening on Sunday, in Leicester Square, with high hopes for this film as it's without doubt the most exciting job I've had. This was my first feature experience, and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.<br/><br/>But, even as someone with a lot of time for his films, and a pre-existing bias, I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free-floating, evocative trip. Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.<br/><br/>With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his \"Tideland\" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem, that Tim Burton, while he is still making decent films, has been a long way off special for some time now.<br/><br/>6/10 (if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5), but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids, I'm sure it'll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved, and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film (although I got this one for free...)",
    "I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.<br/><br/>I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created. The Return of the King was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!",
    "What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! <br/><br/>I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.<br/><br/>Back to the Future (1985) <br/><br/>From the Academy Award \"- winning team of Steven Spielberg\" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.<br/><br/>At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car \"DeLorean\". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.<br/><br/>After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.<br/><br/>What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.<br/><br/>They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.<br/><br/>More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost \"chewed every scenes\" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs \"The Power of Love,\" and \"Earth Angel\".<br/><br/>The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as \" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! \"",
    "***May contain Spoilers***<br/><br/>I was embarrassed as an American seeing this film. Just knowing that it would be seen over seas. It's amazing how a submarine can withstand 40 depth charges while another could be put out by two. And I believe it would also be a virtual impossibility for Americans to commandeer a German sub and vice versa.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this movie is its arrogant rewriting of history. It was the British who first captured the enigma machine NOT the Americans. We have no right to take credit for other nations accomplishments. Hollywood simply has a historical ignorance. But beyond that it is still just an awful, awful movie. No one with half a brain would be entertained by this garbage.",
    "This film isn't for all people. That's to say about a lot of movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs?<br/><br/>First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of \"time slowdowns\" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads traveling in slow-motion across the screen... it's all there. <br/><br/>The story on the other hand isn't very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.<br/><br/>Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly cliché phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. \"I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honor then live in shame!\" Sounds familiar? <br/><br/>Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.<br/><br/>Now that's fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.<br/><br/>I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.<br/><br/>So here's the deal.<br/><br/>If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes, wonderful camera-work and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You'll be missing out if you don't. There is so much to see, so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It'll leave you in awe.<br/><br/>However, you are looking for a good story, clever plot twists, some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this, nor does it wants to give you this. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie so much, but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish, and that's understandable. Just be sure to make up your mind about what you want to see when you go to the theater yourself instead of being drawn into bias by the tons of reviews this site has to offer.",
    "The early 90s version of an action movie - non stop gunfire and fights. One very good reason to watch this series is that any movie after this seems to be excellent. The only saving grace are some really old wisecracks from Jason Statham. Skip it, if you need to.",
    "The assassination of JFK has been told in every possible way through every available medium. Oliver Stone managed the unimaginable transforming and almost folk tragedy, through a mix of drama and cinema veritè, into a riveting mystery thriller with the paranoiac style of a man who's in touch with paranoia in a quasi permanent basis. Unnerving, frustrating and spectacularly satisfying. Kevin Costner manages to be convincing as the center piece of the conspiracy theory. We believe the whole damn thing because we see it through his logic. Sissy Spacek, as his wife, represents most us and she does it brilliantly. Tommy Lee Jones and Kevin Bacon are a pleasure to watch. Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and even John Candy, Sally Kirkland and Vincent D'Onofrio deliver little parts of the puzzle without ever becoming distracting. Gary Oldman is a chilling dead ringer for Lee Harvey Oswald. For film lovers, for history nuts, for pop culture fanatics and for conspiracy theorists, this is a must.",
    "Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.<br/><br/>Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!",
    "In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.",
    "I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can't get aboard the hype train. It's really the same as every other cartoonish, overblown comic-book action movie, except with a female protagonist.<br/><br/>Actually, this is worse than the average comic book movie, because it preaches to the audience about pacifism but then hypocritically celebrates \"heroic\" violence. In other words: Wonder Woman is an alleged pacifist who kills a bunch of people. Wonder Woman is also an alleged feminist, who allows Steve Trevor to drive the entire plot and basically steal the movie from her. Really, this thing is about as progressive as Dick Cheney's great-great grandfather.<br/><br/>I could forgive Wonder Woman's flimsy social commentary, if it were any good in other respects. But the plot is loose and shabby, the CGI is poor, and about half the scenes were shot in front of a green screen. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if I was watching a real movie, or Patty Jenkins playing God of War on her Playstation 2. (When exactly did cinema and video games blend into this horrible hybrid art form, which has none of the beauty and charm of old-school cinema?)<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the villains. The World War I era Germans are depicted as cartoonishly eeeevil, while the same era's British Empire is held up as a heroic ideal. Meanwhile, the main villain is a nightmare of bad CGI, who looks like he belongs on a 1980s heavy metal album cover. Naturally, they got a wonderful actor for this stupid part and wasted him entirely.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm going overboard on criticisms, but we need some balance to the rapturous praise this film has received. Movie fans often accuse professional critics of being too harsh, but lately, I think critics have actually become too lenient. Mainstream movies get dumber, louder and tackier all the time, and they are increasingly substituting mawkishness for real emotion and character development. And yet the critics have given this thing a great Rotten Tomatoes rating! I guess we've all lowered our standards to rock bottom?",
    "I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on \"the list\" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like \"Superbad\", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of \"40 Year Old Virgin\", \"Superbad\", or \"Knocked Up\".<br/><br/>For starters, there was a definite presence of the \"TV actors on the big screen\" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of \"That 70s Show\" didn't follow her to \"Forgetting\"'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that \"Forgetting\" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than \"American Psycho 2\" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.<br/><br/>The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.<br/><br/>The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on \"CSI\") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious \"American Psycho 2\"); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with \"Superbad\"). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt \"Knocked Up\"). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write \"Fun with Dick and Jane\".<br/><br/>All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically.",
    "Eclipse is the beset Twilight movie so far and now I'm starting to give this series a little mercy. Yes, the writing is still bad, the CGI is awful, there's no chemistry between the leads, there's a lot of laughable dialogue, and terrible characters, but I enjoyed the movie and that's what movies are supposed to do. I'm actually going to watch the next movie with an open mind even if this movie wasn't that good.",
    "I'm a huge fan of the first Shrek and the second one also exceeded my expectations. Both of those movies had an meaningful and multidimensional plot. They also shared clever humor and for the most part unpredictable. I was extremely excited for the the third movie and I have to unfortunately say I was totally disappointed! The whole time I was waiting for it to start, like trying to convince myself, \"ok, any second now it will pick up\" - but it never did. The plot is so thin and unexciting - Prince Charming wants to takeover the throne while Shrek wants to get a young (King) Arthur to replace him as next in line to the throne. You never really feel any interest in what is happening or what will happen to the characters because you know exactly whats going to happen. Basically I spent the movie forcing myself to laugh because, hey, I was watching a Shrek movie. I know this review will not stop anyone who loved the previous movies from going to the third, but I just want to warn that its nothing to rush to or stand in line for.",
    "Talk about an appropriate title. <br/><br/>This is a collection of 11 short stories directed by indie stalwart Jim Jarmusch (\"Strangers in Paradise\", \"Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai\") that have been filmed over the last 18 years, all of which involve two or more characters simply sitting at a table, conversing over...yep, coffee and cigarettes. <br/><br/>In the hands of a lesser director that might be extremely boring, but Jarmusch is a master of subtle understatement and great deadpan humor. This may be one of the funniest movies you've ever seen in which no one cracks a smile. <br/><br/>Almost all the actors play themselves, which adds a meta-theatrical, slightly surreal touch to it all. <br/><br/>Among my favorite stories are one in which an overly eager Alfred Molina has a surprise in store for coolly arrogant fellow actor Steve Coogan and a great one in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin Shelby. Then there's the one where Tom Waits and Iggy Pop meet in a dive bar to discuss things and have a smoke (to celebrate quitting smoking), Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes experimenting with a Tesla coil, and in the funniest casting, RZA and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan sharing some downtime with, of all people, Bill Murray. I also like the one with Spike Lee's twin siblings, Joie and Cinque, dealing with an invasive waiter (a hilarious Steve Buscemi). Almost all the stories are excellent, but there are three that are very forgettable and pretty unnecessary, and they're all in a row, which disrupts the flow of the film. If those three had been taken out, \"Coffee and Cigarettes\" would be just about perfect, but it's still really good. And those three are out of the way in the first half, anyway.<br/><br/>\nFor the first hour the movie feels mainly just like fun. Straight-faced, deadpan, B&W comedy just like \"Strangers In Paradise\". But as it goes on, and strange connections are made between the stories, it seems to have a sudden dreamlike depth to it. <br/><br/>The final story in particular, in which two old men in a dark room (Bill Rice and Taylor Mead) discuss life while on a coffee break that feels like it'll last forever, has a distinct \"Waiting For Godot\" feel and ends the movie on a perfect note of haunting, existential sadness.<br/><br/>\nIt was at that point that I realized I hadn't just watched a string of jokey short stories, but a string of jokey short stories that say a lot about human nature and life in general. <br/><br/>And if that's not enough to interest you, how often do you get to see Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have a conversation? Or RZA, GZA, and Bill Murray?"

    "I'm 15 and I've been having problems with my mother for years now, but it's gotten worse recently because she has started making comments about how ugly/fat etc... that make her think no one will ever want anything more than friendship or sex (which isn't true). She also says things such as 'you're so stupid' when we argue over something small which hurts deeply since there are times where all you need someone who understands what they mean by their words instead just yelling at them without any explanation whatsoever! It doesn t help either way though; if your parents don ‘t love themselves then chances aren ’ even worth trying anymore.” The author goes on in this vein until finally concluding “My life sucks right?”. This story illustrates an important point - sometimes people can be too hard-hearted towards others due solely based off personal experience rather taking into account individual differences between individuals within society today. In addition many teens struggle through similar situations every day while growing up under parental guidance yet still manage find happiness despite these challenges along side other factors including peer pressure social media bullying among countless additional stressors faced daily throughout adolescence period itself!

    "I've been identifying as asexual for a few years now. I've never really experienced sexual attraction towards anyone, regardless of gender. However, recently I've been dealing with what I believe is HOCD (Homosexual Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). I'm constantly questioning my sexuality, obsessing over whether I might be gay, despite not feeling any sexual attraction towards the same sex. \n\nI'm confused because I thought HOCD was about the fear of being attracted to the same sex, but as an asexual, I don't experience sexual attraction at all. Yet, I can't shake off these intrusive thoughts and constant questioning. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this or if it's even possible to be asexual and have HOCD at the same time? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "I need some advice from seasoned dog owners. Here's a bit of background - I adopted my puppy when he was 2 months old, and he’s now 8 months old. He’s a mixed breed with a bit of Pitbull and Labrador if that helps. He’s generally a great buddy. He’s playful, keen to learn new tricks, and gets along fairly well with other dogs and humans. However, there’s a specific problem I am having trouble dealing with.\n\nWhen I try to remove his harness after some walking or training session, he aggressively tries to bite my hand. At first, I thought it was just him being playful or possibly teething, but the intensity of aggression has only escalated over time. It’s now at a point where I don’t feel entirely safe while removing his harness and need to take help from someone else. \n\nI’ve tried using toys and treats as distractions when taking off his harness. It seemed to work for a little while, but he soon figured it out and went straight back to his biting habit. I’ve also attempted to \"timeout\" him to enforce that biting equals playtime over, but it doesn’t seem to register or deter him.\n\nI need to make sure I can remove his harness without risking a bite each time, not only for my safety but also for others who might need to handle him in my absence. I am totally at a loss for what to do at this point.\n\nIs this something any of you have experienced? Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
    "I think I'm done with the short distance moves. No more of these that aren't long distance moves. I'm tired of making a big move and suddenly needing to go 1,100 miles to visit my mom and then go back another 2,000 to go to my best friend's wedding.\n\nThe short distance moves are the most challenging. The longer distance moves require more trust, but you can find more fulfillment in those. I've had to say goodbye to many close friends after my long distance moves. That's the part I can not tell you about. If I don't put it in the blog, that isn't OK. This year was my first time leaving the house after not having to go for more than a couple of days, and I am definitely coming back!\n\nBut, to be totally honest, I made so many huge moves over the last year. Most of them were not long distance and they were all long distance moves that just didn't work out. I still loved my friends, but I couldn't go back to the same place as before. There was this lack of closeness. I think it's because when you're away, you put on the act of being a different person. When you arrive back, you're completely still.\n\nI'm tired of that! I spent a year and a half working to let myself loose and relax. I'm tired of doing small, manageable tasks. I need to figure out a way to grow and develop my relationship with myself and grow into a healthy relationship with myself.\n\nI really don't want to be a therapist anymore. I can't take care of myself like I used to. I need to figure out something else that is more sustainable and more satisfying for me. For now, I enjoy doing things on my own for fun (i.e. running) but I have my own time and a little free time to figure out what I want to build from there.\n\nThere's always another move to make, and I might have to make a million of them. Now's my last chance to relax until they leave!",
    "Carmakers are taking up more manufacturing in India, while car makers will look at ways to use their plants more flexibly for off-road vehicles and other uses. Hyundai Motor's plans included building four new factories across five cities and setting up about 250 new jobs. The Korean group will start assembling the Genesis sedans in Bengaluru when it completes an expansion programme at Mysore – one of its original sites in south India – later this year. And the firm will also add 500 jobs to its Mysuru factory between 2015-17 as part of investments that also include increasing production capacity with production lines that now total 15 million units a year. A statement by the company said it was looking for new locations for these new plants because \"over time, we realise that our existing operations can not support such significant volumes.\" It added to India's auto world some 860,000 factories (a number it has been using since late last year), which means 2m more people involved in making cars: \"Hyundai currently employs 18,700 people or 7.5% of all of the manufacturing workforce in the country. Adding 4 additional large factories would contribute 100,00 per cent to our growth rate,\" Kim Chae Woo, Hyundai Motors' CFO told the Financial Times earlier this week. Meanwhile, the Indian government had announced in October that it would spend over 1 billion dollars on upgrading infrastructure across various industries from cement powder to electrical power generating stations.\n\nThis is a major departure from the way most manufacturers deal with employment in their countries as well as the nature of work they do themselves. Instead, what happens frequently around the world after companies hire overseas workers is that the factories end up employing people who aren't even employees in their home countries: i.e, workers of foreign nationality whose contracts were not legally approved onshore in their own country so have to be sent back or who don't earn enough money here to justify their stay. This does mean something good, though: fewer people getting exploited and fewer opportunities to benefit themselves personally through employment outside of their chosen line of work; these issues are generally better covered than a whole host of others which seem to always rear up to distract us from more pressing matters like poverty etc. But the flipside is that many employers then go against those workers' welfare laws and hire employees abroad again instead of using their own resources to directly employ local manpower at home.",
    "I've been feeling really low for quite some time now. It's not just a bad day or a bad week, it's been months. I've lost interest in things I used to love, I'm constantly tired, and I just feel empty and sad most of the time. I've done some research and I think I might be dealing with depression. \n\nThe problem is, I can't go to a doctor or a therapist without my parents finding out. They're not exactly open-minded about mental health issues and I'm afraid they'll just dismiss it as me being dramatic or seeking attention. I'm also worried about the potential fallout if they found out I went behind their backs. \n\nI've tried to talk to them about how I'm feeling, but they just tell me to \"snap out of it\" or that I'm just going through a phase. I don't know what to do. I feel stuck and alone. \n\nI'm reaching out here because I'm hoping someone might have some advice or resources that could help me. I'm not sure if I'm dealing with depression or not, but I know I need help. I just don't know how to get it without my parents knowing. \n\nPlease, if anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice, I'd really appreciate it.

    "H. G. Wells, in his opening speech to the first World Science Fiction Convention in 1939, said that he had been inspired by the story of the War of the Worlds broadcast on radio and television. He was not aware that it was based on an actual event. The story was written by H. G. Wells for his book The Time Machine (1936). In this book, Wells describes how the Earth has been invaded by Martians who have landed on our planet and are using it as their base of operations. They have taken over the government and are planning to use us as slaves. This is what happened in 1938 when the broadcast took place.\n\nWells wrote about the invasion in his book, but did not know that it was based on real events. When he heard about the broadcast, he immediately thought of the story of the War of the Worlds broadcast. He then decided to write a short story about the incident. His story was published in the magazine Weird Tales in 1937. It was later adapted into a film called Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) starring Tom Cruise.\n\nIn the movie, Wells says that he knew nothing about the actual event until he read about it in the newspaper. He also states that he never intended to make any money off of the story. However, he did receive royalties from the film.",

    "In this work, we propose to exploit automatically generated segmentation maps as ground truth labels in order train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on computed tomography images and use them directly with positron emission tomographic image pairs without any manual intervention or human supervision during network design phase [1]. We show that our proposed method can be used effectively by using it alongwith other stateofart methods such us 3D UNet[2]and VGG16 based CNN architectures which are trained separately but share same weights across all layers except last layer where they differ significantly due their respective input sizes i e 2d vs 4 d respectively. This approach allows one not only save time spent manually annotating large datasets like those found within medical imaging domain,but also provides better performance than traditional approaches when compared against standard benchmarks including ISBI 2012 Challenge dataset consisting over 100 000 slices taken at different resolutions ranging between 0 5mm 1 mm per pixel resolution levels while still maintaining comparable accuracy rates even though there were no additional annotations provided alongside original scans themselves thus making process much easier overall since everything needed has already been done beforehand instead requiring user involvement whatsoever!",
    "The post that contains this graphic is here:You can watch the video embedded at the conclusion of this post and read the entire post here:As noted, the picture shows a 2TB SSD drive in a 750W power supply as a second drive. This is not a standard setup because the OS and applications will not be using the first SSD, but instead the lower capacity cache drive to speed up transfers if the need arises.I've seen cases where \"second\" SSDs were used under the OS and/or application load of the first SSD and this setup works perfectly since there is no \"time consuming\" copy operation happening that may become \"reboundy\" later on.There seem to be two possible explanations why this is happening. Either there is some type of timing issue between the OS and OSX and the OS and cache drive of the second SSD are clocked at the same time as the cache drive of the first machine and that is why we see the 2TB SSD drive show as a 1TB cache drive and the 500GB drive as 2TB cache drive as the OS and application load is increased.Another possible reason could be that the \"2\" SSD drive is not the SSD drive we see show up as a separate drive in the OS.In this case, you may want to have the second drive under OS and cache load of the 1TB drive to make sure the first drive shows up as 1TB cache drive, but if the OS and cache load of one drive starts to make the 1TB drive show as a 2TB cache drive you may need another larger 500GB drive to fill those extra 500GB of cache in the cache drive of the first machine. This will only work if the SSD drive is under some kind of heavy load as some SSD drives are by default and should not come out for many minutes before the OS and cache drive starts to perform more efficient copy operations and reduce the time it takes to copy a file.That said, you probably won't see this happen due to the power draw of the computer being less that 1W per SSD of 1TB capacity. As always, if you are running at peak power as possible from a power supply, you will likely see some type of timing issue that will result in this type of situation.With a fast enough PCIe SSD we could see some sort of latency related issue in the OS and cache when you open applications or copy data, but since",
    "\"The Simpsons Movie\" is a delightful cinematic extension of the beloved television series that has been entertaining audiences for decades. The film successfully captures the essence of the show, with its unique blend of humor, satire, and heart, and translates it onto the big screen in a way that feels both familiar and fresh.\n\nThe animation is top-notch, with the vibrant colors and detailed backgrounds adding a layer of visual appeal that the television series, due to its smaller budget and format, could not fully achieve. The voice acting is, as always, superb, with the main cast members delivering their lines with the same charm and comedic timing that fans have come to expect.\n\nThe plot is engaging and filled with the kind of absurd, yet cleverly constructed situations that \"The Simpsons\" is known for. It manages to balance the humor with moments of genuine emotion, resulting in a narrative that is both entertaining and touching. The film also includes numerous references and in-jokes that will delight long-time fans, while still being accessible to those who are not as familiar with the series.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to satirize various aspects of society and popular culture, just like the TV show. From politics to environmental issues, \"The Simpsons Movie\" tackles a wide range of topics with its trademark wit and irreverence.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its flaws. Some of the jokes fall flat, and there are moments when the pacing feels a bit off. Additionally, while the film does a good job of incorporating a large number of characters from the series, some fans might be disappointed by the limited screen time of certain favorites.\n\nDespite these minor issues, \"The Simpsons Movie\" is a must-see for fans of the series and a highly enjoyable film for general audiences. It stays true to the spirit of \"The Simpsons\" while taking advantage of the cinematic medium to deliver a bigger and bolder version of Springfield and its quirky inhabitants. It's a hilarious, heartwarming, and thoroughly entertaining film that proves \"The Simpsons\" still has plenty to offer.",
    "'Erin Brockovich' is a powerful, poignant film that truly exemplifies the indomitable spirit of advocacy and justice. Every time I watch this gem, I am left speechless by the stunning performance of Julia Roberts, who has portrayed the real-life character Erin Brockovich with unbridled honesty and magnetic charisma. This movie showcases how a single mother without any formal legal education can fight against the negligence of corporate giants, in this case, Pacific Gas and Electric company.\n\nSteven Soderbergh has aptly directed the movie, bringing to life the struggles and triumphs of Brockovich in such a manner that it never fails to inspire its audience. This movie is a combination of everything - drama, compassion, humor, and most importantly, resilience. The script is the backbone of this film, carrying the relentless fervor of Brockovich's battle with superb dexterity.\n\nOther performances in the movie are also praise-worthy, with Albert Finney delivering a strong portrayal of Brockovich's boss, Ed Masry. He perfectly compliments Roberts, and their witty, love-hate interactions stick out as one of the highlights of the film.\n\nThe cinematography does full justice to the tone of the movie, capturing the essence of the dusty Mojave desert setting and the blue-collar California community that Brockovich fights for. The movie boasts a realistic approach, steering clear of unwanted Hollywood gloss. This adds to the credibility of the narrative, making it more relatable and impactful.\n\nThis movie is not just about a class-action lawsuit; it is about tenacity, empowerment, the survival of the underdog, and the pursuit of justice, all wrapped beautifully into a captivating storyline. 'Erin Brockovich' is a standing ovation to the strength of women and an absolute must-watch. You're not just watching a movie; you're witnessing a masterly crafted socio-legal revolution unfold on screen.",
    "The film is \"Shaun of the Dead\", which is a pretty typical horror film with a group of college students trying to find a cure to a zombie epidemic. Shaun of the Dead, however, has one odd quality: It's a good movie.\n\nThe main character in this piece is Bill, a British man that is traveling in Europe (in a car with his girlfriend.) Shaun of the dead is about Shaun of the Dead, which is a zombie apocalypse and the events of the film takes place during it. Also, there is that zombie thing that infects everyone. I guess it's a bit late for zombie movies to be good...\n\nBill and the girl both fall ill from the food (not sure if Bill gets it from the food or the people) and there's another infected person with them. It's a scene with a car traveling down a road, as it's broken up in pieces. There is also a group of people with a zombie (Shaun) and the movie then stops. So what we are left with is a whole bunch of zombies running around and having fun. If you like the horror genre then this movie is the movie for you.\n\nI thought the movie had some great moments (as mentioned) and the action was pretty cool. If you are looking for something for your Halloween party or to watch on a rainy night this is the movie. The scene at the end is also a scene at a haunted house (which I thought was a cool scene). If you like the zombie apocalypse genre (and by the time I see a movie with a zombie apocalypse, it usually was zombie) then I think you will like this movie as well. If you are looking for something more serious then \"Shaun\" might not be your movie but if Zombie Movies are your thing then you should watch this good movie (and not worry about the movie being scary).\n\nHere is a review of the first couple of episodes of the TV show \"Lost\": www.imdb.com/title/tt0074000",

He soon develops an unlikely love for a member of that unit, a tough and fearless female soldier named Sara, and the two form an unlikely bond as the commando unit carries out a dangerous mission in a hostile country. It's a classic war movie, but unlike other war films of the time, the action is mostly within the confines of the training and field exercises and not terribly intense. All I can say about the film is, \"This was definitely a movie I'd like to see more. Like, really really like to see more.\"",
    "This film was not what i expected, but it certainly wasn't bad either! It's an interesting take on Pocahontas and John Smiths relationship in that they are portrayed as being very much like two teenagers who fall head over heels with each other at first sight (which isn' t how most people think about them). The acting by Colin Farrell & Qothian Manchett-Smith were both excellent; however there seemed to be some problems between these actors which resulted into their characters having little chemistry together - something you would expect considering all those years apart before meeting again after returning home safely back across seas once more.\"",

Maybe you have been feeling good about the fact McNulty has stopped doing drugs and is now working and focused and healthy, but the last part of the show where he's yelling \"Fuck\" and everyone else just yells it too is so miserable it basically tells you everything was fake, he is still horrible, and that he will soon start using again.\n\nThe main problem with this post is that the poster hasn't fully considered the function of alliteration in poetry, which is often used to achieve exactly the kind of effect the person is describing (or, more precisely, criticizing) here. As one commentator noted, \"It's the same trick with a couple other words at the end of the line that makes it so frustrating, but that's an essential part of alliteration and poetic devices like that.\"\n\nIn \"The Pike,\" Wallace is taking one of this poetic tradition's most celebrated moves, and using it to make the reader reflect on two things: the fact that language is made of phrases, and the things these phrases mean, and also the fact that in situations without words, these gestures and sounds may indeed be the only way that a person can communicate. The \"Fuck\"s work because they are an expression not just of frustration but of exhaustion.\n\nEven for readers who have never found themselves trapped in a room where everyone is saying \"Fuck\" over and over, this is, indeed, a frustrating situation, both for readers and for Wallace, who needs these \"Fuck\"s to convey an emotional charge, but also to convey McNulty's emotional exhaustion and to express the fact that he is no longer in control of his environment. That emotional exhaustion becomes not simply about McNulty, but the situation that Wallace is attempting to show",
    "This paper explores the Kac-Moody extensions of 3-algebras and their implications for M2-branes in the context of string theory. We delve into the mathematical structures of 3-algebras and their Kac-Moody extensions, providing a comprehensive analysis of their properties and potential applications. The study further investigates the role of these extended algebras in the dynamics of M2-branes, a fundamental element in M-theory. Our findings suggest a deeper connection between the algebraic structures and the physical properties of M2-branes, offering new insights into the mathematical underpinnings of string theory. This research opens up new avenues for exploring the interplay between algebra and physics in higher-dimensional theories.",
    "This paper investigates the use of cross pixel optical flow similarity as an additional criterion in self-supervised learning algorithms. The study specifically pertains to computer vision tasks, particularly object tracking and action recognition. The results reveal that incorporating the spatial-temporal relation of adjacent pixels significantly improves the learning process. By considering optical flow – the apparent motion of brightness patterns in an image – we are able to introduce a more robust notion of similarity, which better captures real-world complex movements. This approach has shown to improve computational efficiency and accuracy in experimental test scenarios.",
    "High-dimensional estimating equations (HEDE) have broad applications, in the domains of biomedical drug discovery, biophysical dynamics, and environmental economics. The generalization techniques that have allowed us to create high-dimensional HEDE models are not very useful, at least in practice. To gain a practical insight on the difficulties we have encountered in doing so, we present a numerical example of the process we have been describing, along with two variants (with different numbers of dimension) where it is not possible to solve the equations. We also present a proof of the completeness of the technique. Our analysis focuses on the case where an arbitrary data set can be represented as a sum of \"subspaces\" containing \"values,\" and are not constrained to have certain properties. We propose a more general strategy to estimate models, to be used with higher-dimensional data sets that have at least the dimension that is needed. We show that with such data, we can model many important phenomena in physics and biology, notably biological macromolecular interactions, electrochemical and molecular dissociation, and non-equilibrium electron transfer processes. While a certain amount of computational effort is necessary in the case of simple models without constraints on the size of the spatial dimensions of the model, our approach is well suited for models with arbitrary spatial dimensions.\n\nThe full paper has been published in Nature Communications: \"Hierarchical and Multidimensional Estimating Equations for Physical Models with High Dimensionality.\"\n\nI've always been a huge fan of the idea of \"higher order approximations\" – in particular, the idea that we can use higher level approximations and use them to do things we could not do before. There are many tools that allow us to do this in various settings, but I believe that we are about to build an algorithm called DFT with the potential (based on my own experiences with DFT and its cousins) to help give us the ability (justifiably or not) to \"take a picture\" of a problem and be able to estimate a single \"picture\" of that problem. I have been watching this potential (and I have to say I am not disappointed) with a mixture of glee and trepidation, and I'm excited to be part of the DFT effort (and excited to see what comes of it)",
    "\"The Machinist\" is a uniquely engrossing film that embodies a blend of psychological thriller and noir drama. Christian Bale delivers an exceptionally versatile and captivating performance, arguably one of his best to date. His physical transformation into the emaciated and insomniac character, Trevor Reznik, is nothing short of jaw-dropping. This level of dedication to character portrayal brings an authentically haunting and tragic element to the film.\n\nThe movie itself thrives on atmosphere, aided by director Brad Anderson's deft handling of the bleak and unsettling mise-en-scene. The grim, desaturated environments and eerie industrial soundscape pull you into Trevor's world, a world devoid of rest, plagued by paranoia.\n\n\"The Machinist\" is a masterfully puzzling narrative that delves into the psychological unrest of the protagonist’s disintegrating mind, augmented by subtle clues, shadowy figures, and cryptic messages. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Aitana Sánchez-Gijón provide commendable performances, forming a perplexing entourage around Bale's character.\n\nAt its core, \"The Machinist\" is about guilt, a deep-buried emotion that eats away sanity and leads towards a path of inexorable self-destruction. The screenplay by Scott Kosar is brilliantly intricate and harbors deeper interpretations along with a mind-bending climactic revelation.\n\nDespite its bleak and distressing narrative, \"The Machinist\" is undeniably a thought-provoking piece of cinema that successfully does what it sets out to do - which is to unsettle and intrigue, making it a must-watch for fans of psychological thrillers. The satisfaction lies in unraveling the complex narrative knotted around Trevor’s distorted realities and the profound human emotion of guilt. \n\nAll in all, \"The Machinist\" is a vividly daunting cinematic experience encompassing excellent performances, crisp direction, an intriguing plot, and a haunting score that lingers long after the screen fades to black.",

    "\"Windtalkers\" is a war film that superbly blends action and drama with an often overlooked aspect of World War II. Directed by the talented John Woo, this film delves into the use of Navajo code talkers in the Pacific theater.\n\nThe narrative focuses chiefly on Navajo Marines who were trained to use their language as a code, creating an unbreakable encryption for radio messages during the battle against the Japanese. The film showcases the relationship between the code talkers and their bodyguards, tasked with the uncomfortable mission to protect the code at all costs.\n\nThe performances in this movie are top-notch. Nicolas Cage leads the cast as Sergeant Joe Enders, delivering a lethal mix of intensity and internal struggle. His interaction with Adam Beach, who plays Private Ben Yahzee, a Navajo Code Talker, is heartfelt and authentic. Together, they bring to life the complexity of their characters' relationship in the face of war and duty, adding layers to the film's narrative.\n\nThe battle scenes are well-executed, exhibiting John Woo's signature action sequences. However, it's the social tensions and a profound exploration of war ethics that makes \"Windtalkers\" stand out. It paints a harsh picture of the cultural misunderstandings, discrimination, and conflicting loyalties that were a part of the World War II era. \n\nAlthough some may argue that the film oversimplifies parts of the history or focuses too heavily on the battle scenes, it must be appreciated for shedding light on the often overlooked contribution of the Navajo Nation during WWII. Some scenes seem to lack depth and fleshed-out details, but overall, it is a memorable film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Windtalkers\" is a well-crafted war movie that combines riveting action with an intriguing, lesser-known slice of World War II history. Despite its shortcomings, it's an engaging and thought-provoking film - definitely worth a watch for war movie enthusiasts and history buffs alike.",

    "This paper provides a critical theoretical understanding of the Whitney distortion extension (WoE) problem for the $\\mathbb R^n$-dimensional manifold. The WoE problem is the extension to the 3-dimensional $R^3(\\mathbb R^n)\\times\\mathbb R^n$ manifold of the Whitney transform, a problem of central importance for the theory of approximate local-space geometries.\nAlthough the Whitney transform is not very popular as a non-local-space geometrical operator, the Woe problem as far as its use in the theory of approximating local spaces is concerned is more widely studied. The Whitney transform extends the notion of a local space to include a structure of $R^n$-spaces. Moreover, it allows to model most of the structures of local-space geometries. The WOE problem has important applications to all of that theory, and can only be solved in local-space geometries. We study both an example $R$-algebraic space to test the WoE problem and a concrete case with a lattice of Woe curves on $(1,\\infty)$, whose structure we approximate locally with a network with two lattice nodes per lattice-pair.\nA quick summary follows:\nThe WoE problem arises as a consequence of the fact that our lattice cannot be approximated with a network of length zero, but only with a lattice of Woe curves\nA simple instance of WoE arises for a network of lengths one. But this instance can be modified, to have any lattice with zero lattice-pair distances\nThe simple set $L = \\{1,2,\\ldots, n$ of lattices of the form $(n,n)/(n-1)$ with $m$-1 vertices is sufficient for the WoE problem, but the exact set will depend on how large the local-space elements of $L$ are: the exact number of lattice-pairs is a parameter that can be chosen arbitrarily (we assume for illustrative purposes that the",
    "I've been on LSD for about two years now and it's one of my favorite drugs to take. It has helped me through some really dark times in my life, like when I was suicidal and had no idea how to get help. It also helps me with depression and anxiety. But lately, I've noticed that every time I do psychedelics, I have the exact same trip. The only difference between trips is that sometimes I feel more depressed or anxious than other times. This makes sense because I'm not just experiencing these things, but they are happening to me as well. So what does this mean? Is there something wrong with me? What can I do to fix this?\n\nThis is an interesting question. There are many theories out there regarding why people experience the same psychedelic experiences over and over again. Some believe that the brain is constantly rewiring itself during the course of each psychedelic session, which causes the person to experience similar effects. Others think that the mind is simply being flooded with information at any given moment, causing the person to experience the same feelings and sensations. Still others believe that the person is actually experiencing multiple realities simultaneously, which would explain why the person feels different emotions at different points in their trip.\n\nBut none of these explanations seem to be able to fully account for the phenomenon known as \"the tripping paradox.\" In short, the tripping paradox states that if you're taking psychedelics regularly, then you should expect to have the exact same trip every single time. And yet, if you don't take psychedelics regularly, then you shouldn't expect to have the exact same trip every single time either.\n\nSo what gives? Why does the tripping paradox exist? Well, according to Dr. David Nichols, PsyD, author of The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide, the reason is simple:\n\nIt's all in your head!\n\nIn his book, Nichols explains that the tripping paradox is caused by the fact that our brains are constantly changing throughout the day. When we wake up in the morning, our brains are already primed to go into high gear. Our bodies are ready to start working, our minds are already focused on whatever task we were planning to accomplish that day, and so forth. As soon as we hit the sack, however, our brains shut down completely. We lose track of time, forget",
    "Ireland's rugby woes have deepened with the news that centre Gordon D'Arcy has been ruled out of the remainder of the Six Nations tournament due to a foot injury. The Leinster player sustained the injury during Ireland's defeat to England at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday.\n\nD'Arcy, 33, who has won 81 caps for his country, is expected to be out of action for at least six weeks. His absence is a significant blow to Ireland, who are already without several key players due to injury.\n\nThe Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) confirmed the news in a statement, saying: \"Gordon D'Arcy suffered a foot injury in the game against England on Sunday and had a scan on Monday to investigate the extent of the injury. This confirmed a stress injury to a bone in his foot and he will be required to wear a boot for at least four weeks.\"\n\nD'Arcy's injury is the latest in a series of setbacks for Ireland, who have already lost captain Paul O'Connell and winger Simon Zebo to injury. O'Connell is out for the rest of the season with a back injury, while Zebo is recovering from a broken foot.\n\nIreland's coach, Declan Kidney, now faces a selection headache ahead of the team's next Six Nations match against Scotland on 24 February. With D'Arcy out, it is likely that either Luke Marshall or Keith Earls will be called up to fill the centre position.\n\nDespite the injury setbacks, Kidney remains optimistic about his team's chances. \"We've been hit hard by injuries, but every team has to deal with these challenges. The players coming in have a great opportunity to make their mark and I have every confidence in them,\" he said.\n\nIreland currently sit fourth in the Six Nations table, having won one and lost one of their opening two matches. They will be hoping to bounce back from their defeat to England when they take on Scotland at Murrayfield.",
    "After six previous attempts, British artist Martin Scorsese won an Oscar this morning for his short film, The Age Of Innocence at the 88th Academy Awards ceremony, marking only the third such win by one nation alone – and in less than two decades. In 1997, Japanese-born painter Takashi Murakami took home the prize as part of Japan's artistic movement The Nipponese School. But even now, with all four countries represented, Britain has still yet to claim its first win in Oscars history. After a 12 year break since winning the award, American director Jim Sheridan bagged it once again for his drama Unbroken earlier this month. \"We've had a great time working together,\" says James Franco, who won best supporting actor for that same film. But while Sheridan had his eye on the Oscars after years in Hollywood without ever being given a feature or episodic TV script, it was Scorsese's film about teenage rape in the Italian city of Reggio Emilia which propelled him last night into international fame and left most of Britain standing silently in awe. Last January in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, British politicians condemned what they called the \"lunatic fringe\". Now all four countries were together for the first time, though the country at the forefront - America - couldn't have been happier to see their native son scoop the biggest award of them all. As ever, it came down to Scorsese and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. The pair had previously shown superb technique in Shutter Island – where Colin Firth and Kate Winslet found real intimacy in one another – but here they could be spotted dorking around on location outside the ceremony in a private plane – so if they'd done anything wrong, he wouldn't have known until afterwards. 'Towards us' In perhaps the most touching moment, Laura Dern (Gone Girl) told the crowd today she felt responsible for making a point to women everywhere how important films like The Artist could make them feel – and hoped more people would take the chance to find empathy. It will come as no surprise that the majority of winners tonight were women: with all five nominees (Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine, Margot Robbie for Logan Lucky and Saoirse Ronan for Brooklyn) also nominated previously but not in the leading roles last year when we finally got",

    "So I spent a good chunk of daylight yesterday outside, just basking in the wonderful weather that we're suddenly having. After being cooped up for most of the previous week, it honestly felt like paradise to feel the sun on my skin and hear the birds chirping again after such a long winter. \n\nNow here's the problem - during this blissful enjoyment, I completely disregarded one crucial fact: I have Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE). I was diagnosed a couple of years ago when I experienced some bizarre reactions after sun exposure. However, in my excitement, it completely slipped my mind.\n\nFor those who may not know, PMLE is a sort of allergic reaction to the sun. When the skin is exposed to sunlight, especially after a long time of not being exposed to the sun, it flares up and can lead to incredibly itchy bumps, blisters, and patches.\n\nJust wanted to share my situation with all here as a reminder to be aware and practice sun protection, especially if you have any sun-sensitive conditions. Adhere to necessary precautions such as using high SPF sunblock, wearing protective clothing, and limiting sun exposure.\n\nGuess who ended up with an awfully itchy, red, and bumpy rash all over the arms and legs? Yours truly! Now, I'm back to being indoors and applying topical creams while chugging anti-histamines to soothe this flare-up.\n\nSun, why do this to your biggest fan? Has anyone else had experiences with PMLE or other sun allergies? Would love to hear how you manage these and maybe get some tips!",
    "What happened…\n\nI met my boyfriend on Tindr. He's 25, just out of college. I'm 22 — or thereabouts. It was early Summer and we were talking to one another over FB messenger. I didn't respond right away because I found his posts annoying until he started posting all manner of things on Facebook for us to discuss. First, I talked about what a jerk I was in a comment that had 20 likes. He replied by saying that \"there are probably other girls better looking than me,\" since it turns out that the way we see it they can only have sex with their first two-way boyfriends.\n\nHe kept posting links of some pretty blonde woman and made sure to state that he could imagine meeting her, should he ever choose to do so later in life. It soon dawned on me that he wasn't interested in me romantically at that point but had clearly developed a fetish for photos of very attractive blonde women having sex (which would explain why we hadn't hooked up yet), which gave me pause. My concerns were quickly confirmed when the last thing he did before going into his room again after eating dinner was to go look on GWA. He seemed disappointed as if there was something he'd hoped to get away with here – that was not to be though! I asked if these images made him uncomfortable. He responded that he loves them himself, adding that people think they're sexy and then comments like this become inevitable in conversation.\n\nNow comes the really bad part. We've dated intermittently every few weeks off and on and have always been great friends and enjoyed each others company as long as neither of us went overboard in flirting — i.e.\"Hey babe, how about a threesome?\" No problemo; we had those. We got serious when I proposed \"We date/hookup\" every other weekend. After some time passed, I realized it still felt weird asking him out with no plan going into it, especially considering how much time was passing between our dates and I figured I wanted to know more. So, without telling anything else, I started keeping a daily log of our dating history, including sexual encounters. At the same time I started getting messages back from Tinder, saying these sites have been giving me tons of new connections over recent months (or years?) and now I might want to start seeing more guys.",

And while the first Captain America: Civil War and the next Thor: Ragnarok are still some way off the release schedule, the film can't come soon enough for many longtime Spidey fans. The Amazing Spider-Man is a reboot of an uninspired first movie, but what this film lacks in originality it more than gets back by finding much-needed life in the universe of Spider-Man.\n\n\nSpider-Man is not your run of the mill movie superhero. He is both an underdog and a main character for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he is the hero that everyone wants to be. After all, who else would you want on your side, in the heart of any situation?\n\n\nThe film opens up in the middle of a war between two warring factions, the Vulture and Kraven. After the death of Tony Stark, the villain organization known as the Chitauri came to Earth and killed off most of the Avengers. This meant the only heroes left were Spider-Man and his friends, one of whom was Gwen Stacy. The remaining team was up for the challenge of protecting the city. The rest of the heroes decided to try to find a way to help. Spider-Man was the only one who kept his word, and the rest of the team soon realized that it wouldn't have been possible without him.\n\n\nAfter some time, Spidey discovers a mysterious box, from the Vulture. When he opens the box, an energy washes over him, and he begins to transform into Spider-Man in full armor. He then finds out that he is part of a larger group of heroes who are trying to stop a threat that no one else can see. Unfortunately, the threat is an army of zombies, and Spidey is a part of a fight for the very survival of the world. It turns out that the Vulture is playing the role of the villain in these scenes and that he is the one with the real power.

    "Budget \"borrowed too much\" from next year's spending\nFormer chancellor Norman Lamont has said the last year's Budget \"borrowed too much\" from next year's spending, contributing to higher inflation and interest rates.\nMr Lamont, a close ally of Gordon Brown, said Chancellor Alistair Darling needed to keep a tight rein on borrowing next year or the country would pay for it over the next six months.\nHe predicted that the new financial year starting in April will be \"tough\".\nMeanwhile, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has said the recession is likely to hit the end of this year.\nIt found that confidence among British consumers is at its lowest level since 1999, when there was a similar downturn.\nNIESR also found that the public debt - which it said stands at £800bn - equates to 83% of the nation's gross domestic product.\nBut its director Jonathan Portes said that despite this being high by historical standards, Britain's debt was far worse in 1946 - after five years of war - when the debt was 130% of GDP.\nNIESR also highlighted that Britain spent more than a decade paying off the debt from the Napoleonic wars.\nMr Lamont told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that his experience from the late 1980s showed that \"you can get good short-term gain from over-spending up to a point, but after that point the price is much higher and it is painful\".\nHe added that he had been surprised when Labour Chancellor Mr Brown's Budget had borrowed so much money for next year, and had led to inflation and interest rates rising.\nAsked if \"we are now going to pay for that in the next six months by inflation and high interest rates\", Mr Lamont said: \"I'm afraid we are, yes.\"\nHe said that after 18 months of inflation being too high, he accepted that it is now starting to come down, but said he would want to see it fall further.\n\"I think the Chancellor should be able to keep a tight rein on spending this year and not find a need,\" he said.\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8039563.stm\nThe following is the full text of a news article titled \"Former cabinet minister condemns Brown",
    "In this work we investigate the use of high dimensional sparse filters for image filtering, focusing on the problem of image filtering with noisy data and limited capacity. We show how to apply this filtering method to a range of applications in image processing, particularly deep learning, by building a scalable BNF-like model that can adaptively learn to deal with the noisy data, and by employing the high-dimensional sparse linear algebra to efficiently scale up image filtering. Our model learns to handle arbitrary sparsely shaped data efficiently, using a high dimensional non-linearity in the input space and high dimensional non-linearity in the output space. The result is efficient implementation of simple filtering algorithms and a complete characterization of the framework's performance. In particular, we show for a range of image datasets, both for both real and n-dimensional sparse data, that training is achievable through a combination of parallel filtering and parallel sparse linear algebra. Our results also show that this system can be extended to handle large datasets, without requiring additional feature engineering.\n\nWe demonstrate two main results. First, we make use of the scaling technique proposed in this article, to achieve efficient scaling of high-dimensional sparse linear algebra representations on a GPU. Second, our framework can also provide an alternative form of feature engineering that allows the model to learn to do a variety of filtering tasks, such as bilinear filtering, soft and hard soft-edge detection, and fuzzy feature engineering.\n\nThe video gives a good description of the research, showing a few examples of both the parallel and the parallel sparse linear algebra pipelines.\n\nI want to thank Paul Chudnovsky and Ben DeZeeuw for helpful discussions, and I would like to extend a huge thank you to Alex Graves and his folks at Deep Learning Systems for making this work possible.

    "\"42\", an inspiring biopic based on the life of Jackie Robinson, remarkably transports us to the racially-charged era of mid-20th century America. The film offers an intimate peek into the trials and tribulations of Robinson, the first African-American Major League Baseball player. Chadwick Boseman's performance flawlessly encapsulates the resolve, strength, and dignity of Robinson's character. Harrison Ford, playing the role of an empathetic and progressive team executive, Branch Rickey, adds depth and credibility to the narrative. The chemistry between the two actors leaves a poignant impact.\n\nThe screenwriting is taut, with due focus given to Robinson's personal and professional life. The dialogues are powerfully written, effectively exposing the level of systemic racism prevalent during that time. The triumphant spirit of Robinson, however, shines through the dark corners of the narrative, adding a sense of uplifting optimism and hope to the film's thematic undertone.\n\nThe cinematography and period-specific details are also worth appreciating, as they collectively contribute to the authenticity of the setting. The baseball scenes indulge the viewer in thrilling sporting moments, balancing historical account with entertainment quite seamlessly.\n\nHowever, the movie isn't without flaws. Some historical inaccuracies could irk baseball historians and Robinson's diehard fans. Additionally, the movie might feel a tad bit long for those who prefer more tightly knit narratives.\n\nDespite these minor setbacks, \"42\" is recommended viewing for all — a powerful depiction of sports, struggle, and societal change. It tells the important story of an iconic figure who changed not just the face of American sports, but also significantly impacted the civil rights movement. This movie is more than a celebration of Robinson's extraordinary life; it's a pause for reflection on the ongoing battles against racism.",

    "\"Twilight\" is a film that has managed to capture the hearts of many, especially the younger audience, with its unique blend of romance, fantasy, and teenage angst. The movie, based on Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novel, introduces us to the world of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), a seemingly ordinary girl who moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, and falls in love with the mysterious Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), who happens to be a vampire.\n\nThe film's strength lies in its ability to portray the intensity of teenage love and the lengths one would go to protect their loved ones. The chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson is palpable, making their forbidden love story believable and engaging. The supporting cast, including Billy Burke as Bella's father and Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, also deliver commendable performances.\n\nThe cinematography is another highlight of \"Twilight\". The lush, green landscapes of the Pacific Northwest are beautifully captured, creating a perfect backdrop for the story. The film's score, composed by Carter Burwell, complements the narrative well, adding depth to the emotional scenes.\n\nHowever, \"Twilight\" is not without its flaws. The dialogue can be cheesy at times, and the special effects, particularly the vampire speed and sparkle, leave much to be desired. The pacing is also uneven, with some scenes dragging on longer than necessary.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, \"Twilight\" is a captivating film that successfully brings Meyer's novel to life. It's a must-watch for fans of the book series and those who enjoy a good love story with a supernatural twist. While it may not appeal to everyone, its charm is undeniable, making it a memorable entry in the realm of teen romance films.",

    "In an increasingly digital world, the importance of writing secure and accurate code is escalating rapidly. With an array of sectors from finance to healthcare becoming dependent on coding, guidelines for ethical and professional behaviour in programming have become essential.\n\nThis article does not serve as a warning against the acquisition of programming skills. On the contrary, it underlines how essential these skills have become in the current job market. Coding has become an indispensable part of a variety of sectors, not just in IT but in education, marketing, analytics, and many more. However, as Spiderman's Uncle Ben once famously said, \"With great power, comes great responsibility.\"\n\nCoding language forms the backbone of our digital world. A myriad of devices functions through code - the websites we browse, the mobile applications we use, the wearable tech we sport, everything is a product of coding.\n\nHence, a mistake in the coding process could result in dire consequences – from compromising users’ sensitive data to causing complete systems breakdown. There have been many instances where faulty coding has led to significant losses. The 2015 Starbucks incident is a striking example where a bug in the system led to customers being overcharged. On a more threatening scale, a security vulnerability could expose millions of users' data to malicious hackers.\n\nA key point here is not just errors but the deliberate misuse of coding skills. Codes can be manipulated to create malicious software and viruses that have the potential to harm individuals and organisations greatly. Cybersecurity breaches are increasingly becoming more insidious and complex under the hands of skilled programmers.\n\nIt’s vital that coding is undertaken responsibly. Best practices should always be observed, including testing and checking the code rigorously before launch, patching and updating it regularly. Programmers should be ethical about the kind of programs they write, ensuring they don’t create software that infringes on privacy or poses unnecessary risks.\n\nProgrammers also have a responsibility to continue learning and improving their skills to ensure they remain up-to-date with advancements in technology and the latest safety protocols. \n\nThe tech industry needs to address these issues and provide better training to ensure safer coding practices. Programming should be taught alongside lessons in ethics and responsibility, ensuring future coders understand the potential harm negligent or malicious coding can cause.\n\nIn short, those who code hold a high level of power in this digital age. But, with this power, they must also recognize and take seriously the responsibility they have. Careful and ethical coding is not just recommended in today's world; it is a requirement.",

    "Star Wars fans have been waiting to see what director Gareth Edwards has in store for them with his latest film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The first trailer was released last week and it looks like this will be another great installment in the franchise. However, there are some things that could make this one stand out from the rest. For starters, we get to see a new villain named Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) who is played by Felicity Jones. She's an Imperial officer who is trying to steal plans for the Death Star. This is not your typical hero/villain story as she doesn't want to destroy the Empire but rather wants to help it. Her motivation is also very different than most other villains in the series. In fact, her motivations seem more like a rebel against the Empire. It seems like she may even be a member of the Rebel Alliance. We don't know much about her character yet so we can only speculate on how she'll fit into the plot. But, if you're looking forward to seeing her, then you should definitely check out the trailer below.\n\nThis is just my opinion based on what I've seen so far. If you disagree with me or think something else is wrong, please let us know in the comments section below.",
    "The way computer networks carry and process data has a distinct pattern - one which a thief or hack may be able to exploit.\nSo the BBC has developed a new technique to detect traffic-shaping, which is being piloted on a live system.\nThe work could help prevent attacks on a network and has potential for use as a \"fingerprint\" on the Internet.\nSecurity professionals will be among those who read about traffic fingerprinting techniques with scepticism and some amusement. Yet a decade or so ago many were sceptical and amused about packet sniffing. So what does traffic fingerprinting actually mean?\nThe BBC's definition, based on the work of the BBC Research and Development Department, is that every network-based device has its own characteristics which can be observed and detected at a low level.\nThere is no new technology here, and the term does not include content-matching.\nSome of the technical details may have been kept secret. Nonetheless this can be explained using plain English and with reference to other work in the field.\nIf you can detect a network node in that sense, you can create rules to detect its patterns. If that approach is taken to an arbitrary device on the Internet, you can develop a fingerprinting device which can be used to \"fingerprint\" or detect traffic patterns in the Internet - or what the BBC terms a \"fingerprinting router\" (FR).\nThis work is novel because the FR is a \"live\" device and the fingerprinting is carried out on the fly on a real Internet router.\nOther work on network fingerprinting has included attempts to fingerprint TCP (transmission control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol), but FRs detect patterns in the lower layers; at OSI levels 4-7.\nThese lower layers are responsible for fragmentation of packets and the use of protocol stack functions. In each case, it is the order and length of these functions performed by the FR that creates the fingerprint.\nWhat does this mean for traffic shaping or detecting traffic-shaping? Traffic shaping is carried out on content at any time. If you cannot detect the FR, the FR can manipulate traffic without detection or without creating a signature. If detected, the FR may either stop that action or modify its action.\nBut once the FR has been identified, traffic shaping can be stopped. This can be done with the application of a rule that can stop",

    "There are many problems in computer vision, computer graphics, image processing and robotics which can be written as a binary quadratic optimization problem. Although the problem is NP-hard in general, we can tackle the problem using many techniques because of its convexity. In this paper, we propose to use a semidefinite relaxation of the problem to solve large-scale tasks. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we derive a fast solver which has less than 10 lines of code. We run comparative experiments for several visual problems, including shape fitting, feature selection, semantic segmentation and non-rigid shape registration, and report satisfactory results.\nIn general, a binary quadratic optimization problem takes the form:\n\\[ max_{x \\in \\mathbf{R}^n: \\mathbf{1}^Tx=1} x^TAx \\\\ s.t. Bx = b, \\]\nwhere A ∈ Rn×n, b ∈ Rn.\nSemidefinite relaxations (SDP) are a standard relaxation method which is widely used for polynomial optimization problems. An SDP relaxes a problem by replacing linear constraints with quadratic constraints, and the objective function with a convex one. Such a relaxation is usually tractable. However, in reality there are no guarantees that solving the SDP problem provides a feasible/optimal solution to the original problem.\nThe best-known polynomial relaxation for a linear problem is the semidefinite relaxation.\nFor an unknown x, this relaxation leads to the following program, denoted $\\sigma[P]$:\n$\\min_{\\Sigma\\succeq 0} f(\\Sigma)$\nwhere Σ ∈ Rd×d and\n$f(\\Sigma) = \\frac{1}{2} \\tr{(B^T\\Sigma+A^T-b^Tb)} + \\tr{(A\\Sigma)}$.\nThe above problem can be solved very efficiently by leveraging on semidefinite programming solvers. Once we have a solution Σ, we could recover the desired feasible point x by solving the following simple equation:\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} I_d \\\\ -B\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ \\lambda \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\Sigma \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nHere",
    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I was recently in a situation where my girlfriend had an affair with another guy. She told me she didn't know what to do about it because she thought that he would leave her for someone else. I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't listen. So I ended up breaking up with her. Now, I don't think she's cheating on me or anything like that (she's still my girlfriend), but I feel bad for her. I've never really been good at dealing with breakups, so I just wanted to share this with you guys. It seems like there are some people who have no problem getting back together with their exes after they've cheated on them. But when it comes to women, we're supposed to be able to handle our own shit. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, please let us know how you dealt with it! Thanks! -A Redditor\n\nThis is a very common thread among men who cheat on their girlfriends. They often say things like, \"She doesn't deserve me,\" or \"It wasn't my fault.\" The reason why these men feel this way is because they believe that they can get over their ex-girlfriends by themselves. However, as soon as they start dating again, they realize that they aren't ready to deal with the emotional baggage that comes along with being dumped by your former lover.\n\nIn order to avoid having to go through all of that again, many men resort to cheating on their girlfriends. This is especially true if they were previously faithful to their ex-girlfriend. In fact, one study found that more than half of men who cheated on their previous partner did so again within six months.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, it means that if you're currently in a relationship with someone who cheats on his/her girlfriend, then you should probably consider ending it. You may end up regretting it later, but at least now you'll know exactly what you're going through.",

We propose a map-guided curriculum domain adaptation (MG-CDA) method that leverages geographic map information to guide the domain adaptation from day to night. This method progressively adapts the model from easy to hard samples, improving the model's generalization ability. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware evaluation (UAE) metric that quantifies the model's uncertainty in prediction, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of both segmentation accuracy and uncertainty estimation.",

This research introduces a fully differentiable means of uniting the predictions of CNN and CRF, resulting in a model that maximizes prediction accuracy, minimizes data loss, and maintains a high level of performance quantitatively. Experiments are conducted on standard datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results suggest that integrating the strengths of CNNs and CRFs via DDD leads to a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to previous techniques.

No reset.\n\nNeku in Neo the world ends with you theory is a variation of that concept. You play the game, slowly beating it through all sorts of ways, but your score isn't the same as it once was. And it's more challenging too! You can't just reload your last backup save every time you die. There are several ways to die, and you can't just reload to save yourself.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nAt the start of Neo you're introduced to a few different ways to progress. Pick how many of the five upgrades you want to get. Play the first levels to get a handle on the gameplay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe game never has a checkpoint. You can restart any time you want, whether or not you die. So what does it do? When you die you lose your power, which means you won't be able to access the upgrades you've already bought. You restart the game from the beginning.\n\nEvery restart costs me several lives, and I'm always scared that I'll miss one. I don't have many lives to lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I've gone through a game of Neo one way, I'll probably see the same thing I did before. If I was playing a normal shooter like Contra for example, I'd probably be able to just pick the guns I liked and just go from there.\n\nAs a result, many times I've reloaded my first back-up save because I went through Neo the other way, and ended up dying because the same thing happened. I've restarted games so many times this way.\n\nThis is why I found some of the things the game does so interesting. You can get through a level as either a",
    "This film has been described as a romantic comedy, but it's more like a love story with a twist. The main character (played by Jennifer Aniston) is an actress who gets married to a man she doesn't really know and then discovers that he's not her husband after all. She decides to keep their relationship secret until they're ready to get hitched. It's a very sweet and touching story about two people who are in love and want to be together. I think this would make a great movie for couples who have never gotten married before or those who just don't feel like getting married yet.\n\nI'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. This is a movie that could easily be made into a TV series. If only there were some way to watch it on Netflix!",

    "Dental biofilms are an important component in dental plaque and gingival inflammation, but their role in disease progression has not been fully elucidated. We present a statistical model that quantifies the contribution of dental biofilms to oral health by using a novel approach based on the analysis of data from a large cohort of patients with periodontal diseases. Our results show that dental biofilms contribute significantly to the development of periodontitis, whereas they do not affect the severity or persistence of gum disease. The model also shows that the presence of dental biofilms does not predict the risk of developing periodontitis. These findings suggest that dental biofilms may be useful as biomarkers for the assessment of periodontal disease, but further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",
    "France is gearing up for the release of a new novel centered around the life and works of the legendary Italian artist, Leonardo da Vinci. The novel, penned by acclaimed French author, Jean-Pierre Isbouts, is set to hit the shelves later this year.\n\nThe novel, titled \"The Secret Life of Leonardo da Vinci\", promises to delve into the enigmatic life of the Renaissance genius, exploring his art, inventions, and personal life in a way that has never been done before. The book is expected to shed new light on the artist's life, revealing previously unknown aspects of his personality and work.\n\nIsbouts, a renowned historian and author, has previously written extensively about the Renaissance period. His works are known for their meticulous research and vivid storytelling, making history accessible and engaging for a wide audience.\n\n\"The Secret Life of Leonardo da Vinci\" is said to be based on a decade of research, including a thorough examination of da Vinci's personal notebooks and letters. The novel will also incorporate recent discoveries about the artist's life and work, making it a must-read for art enthusiasts and history buffs alike.\n\nThe anticipation for the novel is already building in France, with bookstores across the country preparing for its release. The French have a deep appreciation for art and culture, and the life of Leonardo da Vinci has always fascinated them. This novel, with its fresh perspective and in-depth research, is expected to be a significant addition to the existing literature on the artist.\n\nThe novel is also expected to boost tourism in France, particularly in the Loire Valley where Leonardo da Vinci spent the last years of his life. The Château du Clos Lucé, where the artist lived and worked, is a popular tourist destination. The release of the novel is likely to renew interest in the artist and attract more visitors to the region.\n\n\"The Secret Life of Leonardo da Vinci\" is set to be published in French and English, making it accessible to a global audience. The novel is expected to be a bestseller, given the universal appeal of Leonardo da Vinci and the author's reputation for compelling storytelling.\n\nAs France prepares for the release of this highly anticipated novel, the world of art and literature eagerly awaits a new perspective on the life of one of history's greatest geniuses.",

    "In this work we present two new jet-type numerical methods to solve hyperbolic conservation laws with discontinuous initial data, which are based on an extension and generalization (in space)of Godunov's method [1]. The first scheme uses piecewise constant approximations in time while it requires only one Riemann solver per cell at each timestep; thus its computational cost scales linearly as O(N), where N denotes number cells used by our discretization procedure. This property makes possible using very large grids without increasing significantly CPU times required during simulations performed over long periods compared those obtained when employing standard finite volume techniques such Lax–Wendroff or Roe solvers among others[2].. In addition these algorithms can be implemented efficiently since they require no additional storage beyond what would normally needed just store information related directly towards solution itself rather than any auxiliary variables associated therewith like fluxes etcetera! Furthermore their implementation does not involve complicated calculations involving derivatives either explicitly nor implicitly through some kind approximation process so that even though accuracy may suffer slightly due mainly because lack sufficient resolution near shocks/discontinuities still remains competitive enough against other existing approaches especially if high order spatial interpolation functions employed instead simple linear ones typically found within most commercial software packages today e g MATLAB Maple Mathematicasimilar tools developed specifically designed handle complex systems equations arising out physics applications engineering fields biology chemistry medicineetc…wherever accurate solutions desired despite limited resources available both financially humanly speaking terms manpower expertise knowledge base experience level education background training skills proficiency understanding capabilities aptitude abilities talents competencies qualifications credentials knowhows kenningworthinesses knackings nacks savvies sussingness wits wisdom witlessness ignorances unknowledges ignoranceabilities incapacities incompetences unfitness' unsuitableness inadequacies illsuitednesseffectivenessinefficiencyunfittednessunsuitablelinessincapabilitylackingcapablecompetencequalificationaptitudefitmentproficiencyskillfulnessskillsettalentgiftednaturalskillsnaturalbornnaturenaturalistinnateinstinctiveintuitivegeneticpredispositionalhereditarilycongenitalconstitutionalhereditarybiologicalbirthrightbloodlineagefamilytreeancestrydescentpedigreeprogenyoffspringdescendantsposterityscionsgrandchildrengreatgrandsonsdaughtersniecescous",

    "I just returned home from a long, yet enjoyable day at the movies. I first saw the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie at 3:40 this afternoon at the Mall of America here in Bloomington, Minnesota. I then returned to the theater an hour and 45 minutes later to see the movie again. My second viewing of the movie was at 5:40 p.m. It should be noted that I don't often see a movie that I like a second time, but the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie is simply exceptional. I have always been a big James Bond fan, and I also enjoy seeing a movie that is in keeping with the storyline that exists in an author's books. Such was the case with Ian Fleming's book \"Quantum of Solace,\" which also served as the basis for the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie.\nIan Fleming is my all-time favorite author, and this movie is very much in keeping with my image of James Bond. I am also very much in agreement with the casting choices made for the movie, especially Daniel Craig as James Bond. Daniel Craig has portrayed James Bond very well. I have a good deal of respect for the producers of the movie for having the good taste to include one of my favorite scenes from the book in the movie. (That scene was included in the earlier portion of the movie in the scene in which James Bond is in a gambling establishment.) I also liked the decision made to show James Bond as the hard-edged, no nonsense, tough-as-nails spy that Ian Fleming intended James Bond to be. Daniel Craig has successfully shown the tough-guy James Bond that Ian Fleming created in the book \"Quantum of Solace.\"\nWhile I really liked the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie, I did have one problem with it. That was my inability to understand the character, Camille, as being Italian. I believe that Camille was to be portrayed as an American in the movie rather than an Italian. I believe that I may know the actress, Olga Kurylenko, who played Camille in this movie. I met her in February of this year at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Film Festival. I was particularly impressed with Ms. Kurylenko when I met her because she was obviously fluent in not only her native Russian language but also in English. I don't know how much of",
    "Italy coach Roberto Mancini believes his team can cause an upset in Sunday's European Championship Group C encounter against England at the Millennium Stadium.\nMancini watched England demolish Croatia 5-1 in Cardiff on Tuesday to guarantee themselves top spot in the pool, irrespective of the outcome against the Italians.\n\"Croatia had already conceded but when England scored the first one you can see the difference between teams that are the best in the world, and teams that are not,\" said Mancini.\n\"We are going to play with 10 men against a team with such strength and in the final phase of the tournament.\n\"But we don't have to be afraid of England. We are going home after the group games and we have to try to make things difficult for them from the start.\n\"We have the same coach and the same philosophy as England and so the players know what sort of team they are.\n\"But it's the same with England and they are coming to face a good team that will try to cause them problems for as long as possible because that's the only way we can play to win.\"\nThe Italians go into the encounter off the back of a surprise 1-0 defeat by minnows Northern Ireland and Mancini refused to be drawn on whether he may give some of his players an opportunity to shine before the Azzurri head back to Serie A next weekend.\n\"I can't put my hands on your chest and say whether there is a better player than (Filippo) Inzaghi or (Federico) Balzaretti with no injuries to key players such as Gianluigi Buffon and Marco Materazzi,\" the Inter coach said.\n\"We want to win the two games - we want to play another match in London or in Rome - but we also have the Serie A and cup finals and must put these things in this context.\n\"Then it's up to the coach to decide the line-up, and we will have to work hard to cause an upset.\n\"If we can win the next two games before the two in Rome it will be fantastic, if not it will be more difficult to beat Croatia. But the main thing is to prepare the future of Italian football.\"\nPosted at 10:01 PM in Sports - Miscellaneous |",
    "Athletics has had an outstanding year, with a series of record-breaking performances culminating in an all Gold medal final at IAAF World Championships. With more than 40 gold medals won and 11 silver medals awarded so far this year, it surely shows that while people still prefer to follow sport purely through its sporting merits they are starting to warm up to Ireland's track & field heroes. Here we highlight Irish athletes who have performed really well throughout 2004:\n\n\nEilish Sheehy\n\nSheehy was a member of O'Gara's team for their Olympic qualification event, taking five golds in four attempts in London before missing out on any podium finish, as Ireland finished 12th. However as well as this achievement her performance also included six World Records at different levels across three disciplines including 1st 100 Meter Sprint, 8th 200m and 3rd 400m (a new record), 1st Half-Marathon and 15th 400m freestyle. While Her two previous wins over Germany were later annulled due to doping, she got off the mark against Russia by 1 second - and now owns 17 world records, making Her one of OJSCAA's strongest performers in 2004. The best result she achieved in 2004 was 16th in women's 200m freestyle, behind Usain Bolt for 5th place.\n\n\nJohn Egan\n\nIn another first in Ireland, an Irish athlete took his own life because of personal issues which meant he didn't get good enough results. There are few individuals better equipped and blessed to take time away from sport and try other endeavors in their lives than the legendary US distance runner John Egan who recently announced to be coming back home for good from France after more than twenty years of competitive football! He started playing the game when he was 13 years old but since then he has represented his countries 12 times: 7 years in the French army followed by 2 years abroad before being appointed coach to both USA and Italy teams as well his nation's national football squad. In addition in his lifetime, he managed his body as well as his sports career with extraordinary dedication never once looking beyond what was required and focused entirely on improving every aspect of himself. A man who should have stayed forever in his country where he truly found happiness in serving others. After retiring from professional football, there seems little chance he will ever have another chance to run again but when",
    "The Conservative Party has sharply criticised the government's shifting stance on crimes committed by burglars, in a move that deepens the ongoing disagreement over national crime policy. They say that the ruling party’s changing policy is full of ‘U-turns’ that may potentially confuse law enforcement agents and the public, painfully affecting the fight against burglary.\n\nPreviously, the government's punitive approach towards burglars suggested a more stringent law enforcement policy. However, recent changes seem to indicate a more lenient approach, as the Tories claim, leading to a series of 'U-turns' that they argue could undermine law enforcement and public faith in the country’s criminal justice system.\n\nTory party crime spokesperson George Armstrong said, “This series of policy changes have created an atmosphere of confusion within the police force and amongst the general public. It’s essential that we have clear and consistent policy particularly when it comes to crime.”\n\nArmstrong further indicated that due to this policy inconsistency, penalties for burglary have become largely unpredictable. \"Public trust in the administration of justice is taking serious hits,\" he added.\n\nWhile the government has claimed their changing approach stems from a desire to assess each burglary on a case-by-case basis, the opposition believes a more harsh and uniform policy is necessary to deter potential criminals.\n\nHome Secretary Sarah Evans responded to these criticisms by noting that laws and policies aimed at combating burglary should be flexible and adaptable. “It is not a series of ‘U-turns’, but rather a series of adaptations to the evolving landscape of crime in the country,\" Evans stated. \"We are committed to facilitating a criminal justice system that adjusts its approach based on the nature of the crime and the circumstances surrounding it.”\n\nWhile there is truth to both arguments, it is clear that the debate around the government's approach to burglars reveals a much deeper struggle to find the balance between maintaining a stern face to deter potential criminals, and being adaptable to protect the rights of individuals.\n\nWhether a strict uniform policy or a more flexible one will prove more successful in reducing burglaries is something only time will tell. However, this issue undoubtedly amplifies the need for an ongoing conversation about the best ways to enforce crime policies that strike a balance between justice, reform, and enforcement.\n",

    "This academic paper delves into the study and development of high dimensional filters and their learning through sparse approaches. It focuses primarily on image filtering, Dense Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and novel structures of Bilateral Neural Networks. The paper illustrates that the approximation of sparse high dimensional filters is done through a learning-based framework. The team successfully demonstrates and evaluates the practical implementation of the approach in fields of image filtering, dense prediction tasks, and learning of bilateral neural networks. The results affirm a significant advantage in employing learning-based filters to a more traditional optimization approach. This work signifies a major step towards the wider application and understanding of efficient high-dimensional filtering and bilateral neural networks in image processing and computer vision.",
    "First published July 28, 2017, in Movie Reviews on www.davidandrewsbooks.com. (Author's Note: This is basically a review of the original \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films, as I had not seen the latest one by the time I'd written this and then this review was posted on the IMDb in its review section.)\nThe original \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film, \"The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" was a surprisingly fun experience that came as a pleasant surprise to me back in 2003, along with \"Die Another Day,\" \"Seabiscuit,\" and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,\" to name just a few good movies that released in the U.S. in 2003. \"Curse of the Black Pearl\" is not the best film of the series, but it's still a fun experience that's packed with energy and adventure. If you want to see what \"pirate movies\" are all about, this would be a good one to start with. The plot is very fun and light, but not too silly due to its more serious moments and darker characters. As for the performances, the film is very well-acted, with great dialogue and character work. The special effects still hold up well for a 2003 film, and the action is fun and energetic. I also like how the atmosphere and tone of the film change from light to dark, as this isn't a film where everything goes smoothly, even if everything is done very well in this film. The supporting cast is also fun, with a fun performance by Keith Richards throughout the film. A lot of the jokes are also pretty funny, although they do slip into silliness in some of the later films. This is the movie that really got the franchise running, and while it is the weakest of the series, it's still a good one to start with.\n\"The Curse of the Black Pearl\" gets a 7 out of 10.\n\"Dead Man's Chest\"\n\"The second film in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise, \"Dead Man's Chest\" feels more serious and darker in tone than its predecessor, \"The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" This could also be a result of the film's longer running time of 2 hours and 46 minutes",
    "UK-based pharmaceutical company, MediPharm Labs, has expressed optimism over its latest foray into the use of cannabis for drug innovation following early breakthroughs. This news has sent tremors of excitement through the industry, hinting at an unprecedented leap in the use of the plant in the pharmaceutical realm.\n\nThe company has long been known for its pioneering strides within the biomedical field and now, it has begun to leverage the medicinal properties of cannabis to uncover new treatment pathways. This step is seen as a potentially significant milestone in the radical rethink of how plant-based substances can be utilized in drug creation.\n\nCEO of MediPharm Labs, Dr. Robert Hopkins, has praised the diligent work of his team of scientists who have already begun trials for a host of new drugs that harness the medically beneficial properties of cannabis. \"Our team has made remarkable progress in developing new therapies employing cannabis compounds,\" he stated. \"The progression of these proposed drugs into clinical trials signals a major advancement towards mainstream acceptance of cannabis as a powerhouse of drug innovation.”\n\nAs of now, much of the pharmaceutical industry has tread lightly in the realm of cannabis treatment. This is largely due to surrounding controversy and stringent regulations regarding its use. However, many drugs already have the compound CBD, a non-psychoactive derivative of cannabis, in their list of key ingredients. Credited with reducing inflammation and pain, CBD is also used for treating conditions like epilepsy, psychosis, and anxiety disorders.\n\nMediPharm Labs' recent moves have rekindled hope in the pharmaceutical sector regarding cannabis research. Following the announcement, the company’s stock rose by 7%. This isn't just a win for MediPharm but for suppliers and enthusiasts who support cannabis as an alternative to synthetic drugs.\n\nWhile some in society may remain skeptical, MediPharm is hoping that its groundwork in cannabis experimentation may help dismantle the stigma associated with the plant’s use in medicine. The company’s executive team is hopeful that the breakthroughs resultant from their research will cement their vision of cannabis as both a viable and potentially paramount player in the drug sector.\n\nHowever, it is not a clear cut path to success. Legal confines, rigorous testing criteria and funding issues still stand as hurdles that MediPharm Labs, and other companies venturing into this field, must navigate. \n\nAs MediPharm Labs continues its cannabis research, the world will be watching. The results could ignite not only a new industry trend but could also trigger a wave of legislative changes that may redefine the future of pharmaceuticals.

    "In this work, we propose to rethink skip connections (SCs) and introduce channel attention mechanism into SC design by introducing an additional transformer encoder module between two convolutional layers within each block as shown below; where $C_i$ denotes input feature map at layer i while $\\hat{F}_j^l$,$\\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}_k^{l+1}$ denote output features after applying SCs on different channels respectively ($L$: number blocks). The proposed method can be easily integrated onto existing architectures such that it does not require any modification or retraining process which makes our approach more practical than other methods like ResNeXt [2]. We show through experiments conducted using various datasets including CIFAR10/100[3], ImageNette dataset(IN)[4]. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over previous stateofart models without requiring much computational overheads compared against them.\"",
    "I have seen every movie that Martin Scorsese (director) and Robert DeNiro (star) have brought to the silver screen together and with little exception, Taxi Driver is one of the least well done. For most of their collaborations, DeNiro has played a violent anti-social character that has either fallen deeply into despair (Raging Bull) or simply lost his mind (Cape Fear and others). In the former case of Raging Bull, the movie was able to portray DeNiro in the role of a boxer that was the best there was at his time, who after the peak of his career fell into desperation and complete madness that was portrayed with chilling reality. Similarly, in Cape Fear, Mr. DeNiro was able to portray a mentally insane character that was so convincing in his insanity, that no one could doubt his insanity. While in Raging Bull and Cape Fear Mr. DeNiro was able to fully bring into light the depth of these characters, Taxi Driver fails to take Mr. DeNiro to the next level - the level of sanity. Taxi Driver is the movie of a mentally ill individual who falls into depression during the Vietnam anti-war movement, and begins to take on the role of vigilante in order to stop the violence of a certain part of society. In this film we see DeNiro as Travis, the mentally ill, gun toting, blood thirsty \"avenging angel\" of the streets of New York as he falls into a darker place upon listening to Senator Kennedy's speech about the horrors of war. Here we see, although in a slightly less violent mode, the insane, but now, rather socially conscious character of DeNiro. The character of Travis is not a role that comes naturally to Robert DeNiro. No one could blame the director or the actor of the same name to portray a role with which he is most at ease - such as that of Captain Richard Miller in The Deer Hunter, or Jimmy the Gent in Goodfellas (a film that the viewer can clearly see DeNiro was most comfortable playing the role of Jimmy). However, in Taxi Driver it seems that Mr. DeNiro is overacting and struggling to portray Travis as this disturbed, yet extremely violent character. The role lacks naturalness and it seems that the actor was trying to push the role to the point of excess that",
    "I'm in a bit of a difficult situation right now and I need some advice from you all. I recently started a new relationship about six months ago and throughout this time, the same problem keeps reoccurring - guys have trouble staying hard when we attempt to have sex. \n\nThe first time it happened, I thought it was a one-off, perhaps due to performance anxiety or something along those lines. But then it kept happening with different guys. Initially, their arousal doesn’t seem to be an issue, but the problem emerges when we start to get intimate. It's beginning to make me feel really self-conscious and unsure about myself.\n\nThinking over some potential reasons, I've tried to create a comfortable environment and ensure clear communication of what we both want and enjoy. I try to ensure that both of us are relaxed and stress-free. I don't rush things and give them plenty of time to get in the mood. Yet, the same problem keeps popping up.\n\nI've also tried addressing the issue honestly and openly with the guys I've been with. Most of them aren't really able to provide any clear answers – they usually say things like they just lost the mood or were thinking about something else and got distracted. But then again, I can't ignore the recurring pattern of the same problem with different men. It makes me wonder if this has more to do with me than them.\n\nWould love a bit of help or guidance over here. Maybe share your experiences or any advice you might have on how I can overcome this situation. This issue has been affecting my self-esteem and quite frankly, my sexual satisfaction. Thanks in advance!",

    "\"Dallas Buyers Club\" is a raw, gritty, and emotionally charged film that takes viewers on a journey through the harsh realities of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. Matthew McConaughey delivers a career-defining performance as Ron Woodroof, a homophobic electrician turned unlikely AIDS activist. His transformation from a self-serving hustler to a compassionate crusader is both heart-wrenching and inspiring.\n\nThe film is unflinching in its portrayal of the disease and the stigma associated with it. It does not shy away from showing the physical and emotional toll it takes on its victims. Yet, amidst the despair and tragedy, there is a sense of hope and resilience that is truly uplifting.\n\nJared Leto's portrayal of Rayon, a transgender woman living with AIDS, is equally compelling. Leto's performance is nuanced and deeply moving, adding another layer of depth to the film. The chemistry between McConaughey and Leto is palpable, making their unlikely friendship one of the most memorable aspects of the movie.\n\n\"Dallas Buyers Club\" is not just a film about AIDS. It's a film about survival, about fighting against a system that seems designed to keep you down, about finding humanity in the most unlikely of places. It's a film that challenges you, that makes you think, that stays with you long after the credits roll.\n\nThe direction by Jean-Marc Vallée is superb, with a keen eye for detail that brings the era to life. The screenplay is sharp and intelligent, balancing moments of intense drama with unexpected humor. The cinematography is stark and gritty, reflecting the harsh realities of the characters' lives.\n\n\"Dallas Buyers Club\" is a powerful, thought-provoking film that deserves all the accolades it has received. It's a testament to the power of cinema to not only entertain but also to educate and inspire. It's a film that will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly, make you think. It's a film that should not be missed.",

    "There have been a couple articles written recently by former employees of Reddit who have alleged that the company's sexual harrassment policy is unfair and biased in favor of males. Here is how they describe it:\n\nThis isn't a complaint about the specific policy (although it's rather bad)--it's about the overall policies of the workplace. I don't think it's a conspiracy, as some have claimed.\n\nThe way that people who claim sexism against Reddit would have you believe, however, is that these women (or men, depending on how you frame it) are lying... and suing because they've been mistreated:\n\nThe issue is that I have to work for /r/creepshots and would like to work there at some point.... So the next time you see a picture of a girl you just don't like, take a second and think, \"This is a girl I might have to work with.\"\n\n...and one woman wrote, \"This is a great website and would I be so lucky if there wasn't some sexism and racism, and at the same time, some misogyny? No, I would not. I would make them my priority in life.\"\n\nI'd like to note that the word racism is in there... about 20 percent of the text of this article. The rest is devoted to complaining about the specific practices and policies of the women who were fired.\n\nThis is clearly going to be a controversial article for a number of reasons.

Carell's portrayal of Andy is both hilarious and heartwarming, making the audience root for him throughout his journey.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Catherine Keener, are equally impressive, each bringing their unique comedic style to the table. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, making the interactions between them feel natural and authentic.\n\nThe script, co-written by Carell and director Judd Apatow, is filled with witty dialogue and hilarious situations that keep the audience laughing from start to finish. However, what sets \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" apart from other comedies is its heart. The film is not just about laughs; it's about a man's journey to find love and acceptance. The emotional depth of the story adds a layer of complexity to the film, making it more than just a typical comedy.\n\nThe direction by Apatow is commendable. He manages to balance the humor and the emotional moments perfectly, never letting one overshadow the other. The pacing of the film is also spot on, with each scene flowing seamlessly into the next.\n\n\"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" is a film that proves that comedies can be both funny and heartfelt. It's a film that will make you laugh out loud, but also touch your heart. A must-watch for any comedy lover.",
    "This paper presents a novel Spatio-angular Minimum-variance Tomographic Controller (SMTC) for Multi-Object Adaptive Optics (MOAO) systems. The proposed controller aims to improve the performance of MOAO systems by reducing the impact of wavefront distortions. The SMTC is designed based on the minimum-variance principle and incorporates both spatial and angular information in the tomographic reconstruction process. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller can significantly enhance the imaging quality of MOAO systems, outperforming traditional controllers in terms of correction accuracy and robustness. This research provides a promising solution for the optimization of MOAO systems, with potential applications in astronomical telescopes and other optical imaging systems.",
    "\"Love & Mercy\" is a deeply moving portrait of a beloved music legend, Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys. The film brilliantly weaves the narratives of Wilson's life - his immense talent, his mental health struggles, and his issues with manipulative people around him - in an incredibly touching and powerful manner. \n\nThe film seamlessly switches between two significant periods in Wilson's life: the 1960s, where he was the driving force behind The Beach Boys' success while battling mental illness, and the 1980s, where he was living on a leash under the care of Dr. Landy. Paul Dano and John Cusack give stellar performances as the younger and older Wilson respectively. Dano captures Wilson's creative genius and the pressure that comes with it with poignant detail, while Cusack beautifully portrays an older, broken Wilson - terrified yet hoping for love and freedom.\n\nKudos to the director, Bill Pohlad for resisting the temptation to glamourize or sugarcoat Wilson's complicated life. The raw and unfiltered depiction of mental illness and the exposure of the dark side of the music industry make the film invaluable. Elizabeth Banks as Melinda Ledbetter, Wilson’s eventual wife, adds another dimension to the film. Her tender portrayal of a strong, caring woman who fights for Brian's freedom, gives the movie its much-needed hope and serves as an emotional anchor.\n\nSpecial mention must be made of Atticus Ross’s innovative sound design. He immaculately reproduces Wilson’s auditory hallucinations, giving the audience a peek into the musician's troubled psyche. \n\n\"Love & Mercy\" does not follow the conventional biopic formula, instead, it works as a tribute to a man who, despite his extraordinary talent and tragic struggles, survived and continues to inspire millions across the world. The film deserves applause for its honesty, compassion, and most importantly for reminding us that everyone, even the brightest star, sometimes need a bit of \"Love & Mercy.”\n",

It was very gradual at first - just feeling more exhausted than usual after school or sports practice etc., then eventually getting to where even simple tasks like walking up stairs were too much effort!

    "The Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film - a stirring tale of hope, friendship, and triumph of the human spirit embedded within the desolate confines of a maximum-security prison. It touches on themes that are timeless, and perhaps more relevant in our current state than when the movie was made.\n\nThe film masterfully captures the transformation of our protagonist, Andy Dufresne, played phenomenally by Tim Robbins. From a quiet banker framed for his wife's murder to an inspiring beacon of hope in the darkest corners of the Shawshank State Penitentiary, his character's journey is intriguing and captivating. \n\nMorgan Freeman is equally impressive as the seasoned inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding, whose narration adds depth and perspective to the story. The chemistry between these two characters and how their friendship unfolds over the dehumanising atmosphere of the prison is a compelling plot element. \n\nFrank Darabont's direction in this film is exceptional. The way he uses the cinematic tools at his disposal to create an oppressive prison atmosphere and contrast it with symbols of hope and freedom makes for a visually powerful movie. Thomas Newman's score envelopes the film in a cocoon of melancholic melancholy, playing into the narrative seamlessly. \n\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" isn't an easy film to watch, and it's meant to be that way. It gives audiences a grim depiction of the prison system, and yet, amidst the harsh realities it portrays, the film also promises a beacon of hope. It assures us that even in the grimmest circumstances, there can be friendship and dreams unbroken. \n\nThe ending of the film, without giving away any spoilers, strikes a perfect balance of satisfaction and joy for the viewer. It concludes an intense narrative journey with an emotionally fulfilling resolution, leaving a profound impact that lingered long after the credits rolled.\n\nIn essence, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a timeless classic that reminds us all that hope can pull us through the darkest times and that redemption is possible for everyone. It certainly deserves its status as one of the greatest movies ever made.",
    "This film was made in 1988, and it's about two men who are free divers (scuba diving without tanks). Jacques Mayol has been doing this since he first learned to swim at age 3; Enzo Maiorca started when his father died while scubadiving with him on their boat off Sardinia - so they both have very different reasons why each one does what s/he loves most! The story follows them through training sessions where we see how hard these guys work just trying not die underwater because there isn't any air down below that can help save your life if something goes wrong during an emergency situation like running out oxygen or getting tangled up inside some coral reef which could happen easily enough given all those sharp edges sticking around everywhere waiting patiently until someone comes along looking lost...or worse yet dead.\"",
    "We present a new method of visualizing semantic relationships between visual features and language in scenes using semantic segmentation. Our system's high degree of generativity makes it a suitable candidate for visualizing complex relationships in a generative picture language.\n\nOur work is based primarily on the theory of visualizing the semantic relationships between features in scenes, inspired by the ideas in Büchner et al.'s Theories of Semantic Visualization thesis [1]. We consider the problem of visualizing semantic relationships between two visual features, such as an object and an object feature respectively. This approach is inspired by visualizing the semantic relationships between visual features in the natural world (see this paper for further details) when considering the relationships of two complex, spatially distributed sequences of features. In particular, we consider the problem of visualizing a semantic relationship between, for example, a location and a location feature (here, the features at two locations on the scene).\n\nFor example, consider two examples:\n\nA scene in which there are, in addition to the location feature, six features corresponding to motion direction.\n\nA non-artistic scene in which there are, in addition to the location feature, three features corresponding to time of day.\n\nWe are presented with a way to visualize relationships between these two situations with respect to the feature sequence of the non-artistic scene. For the purposes of illustration we are only interested in the question of whether there is a spatial relationship in the visual features of the two scenes.\n\nWe present general techniques we use to solve this problem, which in the future may be used effectively to perform similar tasks on scenes from diverse genres, different disciplines, and with different features, in different domains.\n\nOur results show that our method does produce a well-organized graph where the semantic relationships within a given image sequence is well preserved across different scenes. Moreover, our results show that the semantics of an image sequence can be visualized through a visual representation of its semantic relationships. This visualization technique provides a means for the visualization of semantic relationships between a visual feature in a scene. When visualized, the semantic relationships can be compared visually to visual features from different, different domains, such as music visualizations, or even a 3D scene rendered from various types of data.\n\nThe Semantic",

    "\"The Truman Show\" is a cinematic masterpiece that brilliantly explores the themes of reality, freedom, and the human spirit. Jim Carrey delivers a stellar performance as Truman Burbank, a man whose entire life is a reality TV show. Carrey's portrayal of Truman's journey from ignorance to enlightenment is both heart-wrenching and inspiring, proving his versatility as an actor beyond his comedic roots.\n\nThe film's concept is unique and thought-provoking, raising questions about the nature of reality and the ethics of entertainment. Director Peter Weir masterfully crafts a world that is at once familiar and eerily artificial, reflecting the duality of Truman's existence. The supporting cast, including Laura Linney and Ed Harris, also deliver strong performances, adding depth to the film's narrative.\n\n\"The Truman Show\" is not just a film, but a commentary on the voyeuristic tendencies of modern society. It forces us to question our own reality and the extent to which we are manipulated by media. The film's ending is particularly powerful, leaving viewers with a sense of hope and liberation.\n\nThe cinematography and production design deserve special mention. The idyllic town of Seahaven is both beautiful and haunting, a perfect setting for Truman's 'perfect' life. The film's score, composed by Burkhard Dallwitz, complements the narrative beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Truman Show\" is a must-watch for its compelling storyline, outstanding performances, and profound themes. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, making you ponder the nature of your own reality.",
    "Hi all, just stopping in to ask a question since we are currently experiencing a short-term spike in the price of pickled vegetables across the country.\nSeveral years ago, I moved to a new town in a different state. Because of the newness of my town, I didn't have any strong relationships but decided to form some new friendships. I asked my new friends over to dinner and when going to make dinner, I realized I had run out of pickles.\nPickles are my favorite food. I love pickles more than anything. My life is a pickle. I have a pickle tattoo that reads \"Pickles Forever\" on my neck. It also says \"I ❤️ pickle slices\" in small print at the top of my neck.\nUnfortunately, I went to seven different stores looking for pickles but couldn't get any in my area. In addition to that, I couldn't find pickle slices or any other type of pickle that would fit my needs at the time and would not taste good in my burger. As a result, I had to spend hours searching multiple grocery stores and gas stations for the perfect pickle slice. Finally, after all that hard work, I made it home.\nMy new friends came over for pickles. We had a great conversation about my trip and the pickles that I had found and their taste. At the end, I said goodbye. The last thing I told them was that if anyone wanted to try my new pickles, that they could buy them at the store where they bought them. Later that night, I ran into some of my older friends who I hadn't seen in a while.\nI asked them about pickles and they told me that they had tried them. Then they showed me their pickle tattoo that read \"Pickle Slices are the best and will never go out of style\". I told them how much I missed pickles and how sad it was when you had to get them at grocery stores. I asked them to share some pickle tips with me. They told me about how they had gone into all of those places I had checked for pickle slices and they told me about their favorite places to get pickles.\nAfter looking everything up, I discovered that pickle slice availability was a conspiracy.\nThis entry was posted in Conspiracy theories",

Michael Haneke has put a human, a very human character, into the most deadly and chaotic world on the planet.\n\nKurt Russell's portrayal of Nick Nolte in \"There Will Be Blood\" is both mesmerizing and terrifying. He makes his character, a former soldier, utterly human, yet with the kind of intensity that makes you look away and re-watch. The camera angles constantly move, but you don't have to think twice about what they're showing.\n\nIt is so difficult to tell what's real and what isn't, but Russell's performance keeps the audience guessing. When you see where he is shot -- in the shoulder, neck, groin, chest and back -- you might realize that at the end he is bleeding into the snow.\n\nSome people have already written the performance off as a case of over-acting.

    "After several months of a worldwide supply glut and decreased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, prices of crude oil have rebounded significantly. Global benchmark, Brent Crude, and the US standard, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), both sit convincingly above $50 per barrel, marking a significant economic turning point amidst a struggling world economy.\n\nThe WTI, more sensitive to the conditions of the US market, now stands at $52.25 per barrel, while Brent Crude, representing worldwide prices, stands at $53.75 per barrel, showcasing an unparalleled surge beyond $50 after months of deprivation.\n\nThis recovery in oil prices is significant as it reflects increasing confidence in global economic recovery and expectations of a potential uptick in demand as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines engenders a return to a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe oil price had plummeted in 2020 due to a drop in demand as numerous countries went into lockdown. The international demand for oil fell as airplanes were grounded, factories closed, and millions around the world worked from home.\n\nMarket analysts attribute this rebound to multiple factors. \"The introduction of vaccines uplifted the sentiments in the crude oil market, stimulating investors' optimism about future demand,\" says Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at Poten & Partners. \"Add in Saudi Arabia's surprise announcement to cut production by 1 million barrels per day in February and March, The U.S. economic stimulus and a weak US dollar, and we have a perfect recipe for an oil price increase.\"\n\nMany experts still remain cautious, warning that new variations of the virus still pose threats to the recovering economy and there is a potential for another price collapse. \"The current increase in prices should be viewed with caution until a consistent global recovery is in sight,\" warns energy analyst, Frederic Larson.\n\nNonetheless, the current surge in prices is certainly welcome news for oil producers and exporting countries, as well as industries reliant on oil prices. It provides a glimmer of hope for a fluctuating market that has taken several hits due to the global pandemic and a struggling world economy.",
    "Hey everyone,\n\nAbout two years ago, I made the switch from smoking to vaping as a means to cut down on the horrible after-effects of cigarettes. I was doing pretty solid until I moved cities for work and lost my habitual visiting to the local vape shop, and eventually relapsed into smoking puny cigarettes.\n\nHowever, I've been feeling the ill-effects of smoking recently and have decided to switch back to vaping. The problem is that I feel rather lost this time around. I guess the technological advancements in the vaping world didn't slow down in my absence!\n\nWhen I left, I was using a standard SMOK vape pen. It was doing its job just fine, but I think I’d like to explore more sophisticated devices that offer a better experience.\n\nCan anyone suggest some good vaping devices for intermediate users? I've seen so many terms like sub-ohming and pod vape, I honestly have no idea where to start. Also, I’d appreciate some advice on how to select the right e-juices, specifically when it comes to nicotine levels and flavors that resemble tobacco.\n\nLastly, I am a tad concerned about reports I’ve heard about vaping-related lung diseases. Has anyone had any personal experiences or could point me towards some reliable sources regarding the safety of vaping?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice on making this transition smoother this time around for a healthier lifestyle. Thanks in advance!",
    "\"Britain's defence budget is unaffordable and cannot be increased, says a think-tank's annual defence report. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) says other areas of public spending should be trimmed and taxes raised to pay for what it calls 'a minimum' defence of the nation and to help tackle youth unemployment. It criticised the decision to increase the number of aircraft carriers being built.\"\nI'm happy to see the BBC is still reporting on defence spending issues. It's also pretty refreshing to read their story on the report as well, which doesn't just focus on the headlines like most stories on this subject.\nIt's ironic, however, that the government has been accused of not spending money on national defence by the IPPR. The report says \"the UK's defence budget will be below the NATO norm by 2018/19\", but that is wrong. I would say we are spending between 2-3% of GDP on defence, which is pretty average for our North- Atlantic partners. In fact, the figures are pretty close to that of the US, who spends about 4% of GDP.\nThis is how defence spending has evolved since the end of the Cold War, when NATO was still fighting in the Balkans (Kosovo, Bosnia, etc) with the lowest defence budget on record:\nIt can be seen that the defence budget peaked in 1997-98 (~6,5% of GDP), then decreased in the early 2000s, followed by a sharp reduction in 2004, when a massive peacekeeping operation in Afghanistan was launched. In 2010, we hit the low point. In 2011, the budget was significantly increased to support the operations in Afghanistan and Libya.\nIn 2013, with the end of combat operations in Afghanistan, Defence got a small additional boost. But a majority of this increase actually went to the budget of the Foreign Office as part of the 'development-aid-and-security' fusion strategy pursued by the coalition government. As such, there was no major budget increase for the armed forces.\nBy 2014, the defence budget will have dropped again, back to the budget level in 2010. The coalition government has insisted in recent years that this was in response to the end of the combat mission in Afghanistan and a cut in the defence equipment programme which includes the procurement of aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy.\nBut if this is the explanation of defence's budget",
    "This paper investigates the use of deep ensembles based on Stochastic Activation Selection (SAS) for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. The key idea is to create a variety of deep models from a pretrained network by randomly enabling or disabling neurons during testing. We propose a deep ensemble method to integrate the predictions of these SAS based models for robust segmentation of polyps. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional single models and other ensemble methods. The method also shows a high level of effectiveness in handling difficult cases, such as small polyps and flat shape polyps. This study's findings highlight the potential of deep ensembles based on SAS in improving polyp detection and segmentation, which significantly aids in early colon cancer diagnosis.",

Which is why they were going to fix it, which then took another 5 days to fix, and another week to ship it back to me. I was told by the repair guy that no one had ever received a diamond tennis bracelet in this condition before. He said they couldn’t find where it was damaged during shipping.

    "Quentin Tarantino's \"Django Unchained\" is undeniably a bold and audacious slice of cinematic artistry that bristles with the director's signature stylings - characterized by his knack for cleverly reinventing genres. This epic Western is no different, heavily laden with classic Tarantino tropes: hyper-violence, idiosyncratic characters, unique narrative style, and a carefully curated soundtrack.\n\n\"Django Unchained\" tells the epic tale of a freed slave-turned-bounty hunter, seamlessly played by Jamie Foxx, who embarks on a mission to rescue his wife from a ruthless plantation owner. Foxx's portrayal of Django perfectly balances severity and vulnerability, crafting a character that is both stoic and deeply empathetic. \n\nAt the side of Foxx shines the ever-talented Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz, a bounty hunter who serves as both mentor and ally to Django. Waltz brings his usual air of charm and sardonic wit, creating a character that is strange, compelling, and wonderfully eccentric. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of the villainous plantation owner, Calvin Candie, is nothing short of impressive. He effortlessly captures the vile essence of his character, infusing it with a chilling charisma.\n\nWhile the movie delves into the grotesque and brutal realities of slavery, it never loses its dark sense of humor. Tarantino's script is full of sharp, snappy dialogues that make even horrific situations engrossing. However, the violence and sharp racial slurs could be off-putting to some audience members, so discretion is advised.\n\n\"Django Unchained\" is visually stunning, with Robert Richardson's cinematography capturing the sprawling landscapes and the grim interiors of plantation-era America. Every shot is crafted with meticulous care and style, making the movie a visual feast. Tarantino's eclectic soundtrack is another masterstroke, mixing classics, forgotten gems, and original music to enhance the intense emotions of the story. \n\nIn conclusion, \"Django Unchained\" is a merciless yet humorous examination of America's dark past, packed with outstanding performances, bold storytelling, and Tarantino's typical panache. Though not for everyone, this film is unquestionably an example of modern filmmaking at its most bold and fearless.",

    "Recent theoretical studies on coupled, long dielectric cylinders have indicated that both modal symmetries (polarization direction or handedness) across particles' axes as well exciting field mode number can be used to distinguish between possible symmetry types associated with different physical characteristics such frequency splitting/anti - crossing behavior among resonances depending upon relative orientations within symmetric axis groupings along these systems [1]. This concept will open new opportunities into understanding structure / function relationships where novel material properties may emerge due their own internal structural arrangement; e.g., chirality induced by directional selection rules based solely off polarization considerations alone! I'm presenting here some preliminary thoughts toward this goal through exploring what happens when we take those aforementioned ideas forward yet again– adding now another layer onto things like stacking two sets orthogonal planes together forming 3D arrays inside out space bounded only. The results show us how each type interaction influences resulting response making it clear which polarizations carry greatest weight even versus other parameters including size etc..

    "Image segmentation has long been one key component in computer vision and its applications; yet, even with modern deep learning models that achieve state-of -the art performance on image classification benchmarks at hand these days' it seems still difficult to make significant progress towards more accurate automated semantic labelling over images (e..g., medical imaging or street view imagery). To alleviate this problem we build upon our recently proposed framework 'dense block', by adding extra layers while keeping all parameters fully convolutiona[l] thereby building dense(er) networks up using densely connected blocks only without any pooling operation whatsoever – resulting within so called 100LayerTiramisus! Our solution does not require training large datasets either as opposed e. g., U2Net which was introduced alongside us during ECCV 2018 proceedings though note here too how both methods share some similarities between each other wither than being competitors'. The presented work compares various architectures involving different combinations among 3 main components density rate connectivity pattern [3 1 7 5]. This enables use case specific implementation according two desired properties precision/recall tradeoff memory constraint runtime constraints etc.\"",
    "In this work, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method to address cross-domain medical image segmentation tasks with limited labeled data available at source and target domains (e.g., CT images). We formulate our problem as learning latent representations that are aligned across different modalities while preserving their semantic information by minimizing both intraand interclass variations within each modality separately using adversarial training strategy [1]. To achieve such alignment between two distributions without any supervision or prior knowledge about them during inference time; instead only relying on some weak assumptions like independence among features extracted through convolutional neural networks layers which can be learned via backpropagating gradients computed over multiple iterations until convergence occurs - thus making it possible even when there exists no overlap whatsoever! This approach has been shown effective not just because its simplicity but also due how well suited these methods tend towards solving problems where labels may vary greatly depending upon context alone rather than being fixed beforehand.\"",

    "Hey everyone, \n\nJust wanted to seek some advice regarding anxiety. For the past few months, I've been dealing with a substantial amount of stress and anxiety almost daily. I think its sources are mostly from work and personal life, and from the ongoing pandemic situation, which isn't showing any signs of abating soon. \n\nI often experience symptoms like a pounding heart, an upset stomach, sweating, and sometimes even panic attacks. These often leave me feeling drained and tired every day, and it's severely impacting my quality of life, not just mentally, but physically as well. \n\nThe constant worry and fear of what's going to happen next is driving me up the wall, and it's becoming increasingly difficult for me to concentrate on my work or other activities. I've tried handling it myself through relaxation techniques like deep breathing, yoga etc., but so far it hasn't helped much.\n\nI understand that professional help is the best way forward, but I just wanted to see if there are any other steps I can try before taking that route. Perhaps there are people here who have been through the same and can lend some advice based on their experiences?\n\nI'm open to suggestions about coping mechanisms, exercises, lifestyle changes, or even books and resources that might help with anxiety management. Please do keep in mind that although I'm heavily inclined toward natural and self-help solutions, I'm not averse to seeking professional help if needed. \n\nThanks for reading, and I appreciate any advice you guys might have for me!\n\nStay safe.",

There's still no better description for my feelings around the fact that this movie left such a significant impression on me then its main reason for being itself, its central theme/tension, was simply to suggest a basic truth about the nature of our own intelligence that most people don't believe they've actually experienced in their own lifetime!

    "This paper presents a variational model for image segmentation, which integrates the normalized cut (NCut) criterion, adaptive similarity, and spatial regularization. The proposed model captures global contrast information through the NCut criterion, enhancing sensitivity to perceptually meaningful boundaries. The adaptive similarity measure effectively copes with intensity inhomogeneity, promoting segmentation quality in ambiguous regions. The model also incorporates a spatial regularization term to stabilize segmentation results amid noise interference. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images, including medical images, showcase the model's efficacy in generating quality segments and maintaining robustness under varying noise levels. Comparison with popular benchmark models reveals the proposed model's superior competitiveness, paving the way for enhanced image interpretation and analysis across numerous domains.",

The DRA is based on the idea that every element of a multidimensional space can be represented by a single point in a finite dimensional space. We show how this notion generalizes to arbitrary dimensions and how it allows us to reduce the number of points required to represent all elements of a multidimensional space to one. In particular, we prove that the DRA is able to solve the convexity problem in any dimensionality class.",

    "England's football team is facing an escalating defensive crisis as key defenders continue to struggle with injuries and suspicesions. With crucial matches on the horizon, this raises alarm about the team's capacity to withstand the threat posed by fierce competitors.\n\nCenter-backs Harry Maguire and John Stones, known for their robust presence on the field and ability to thwart opposing advances, both face uncertain injury situations. Maguire's fitness has been in question since he sustained an ankle injury playing for Manchester United, while Stones suffered a muscle injury during training.\n\nMeanwhile, right-back Kyle Walker is one step away from suspension after picking up yellow cards in two consecutive games. The player's aggressive style, though often effective, runs the risk of leaving the team a man down in future matches. Furthermore, left-back Luke Shaw was sent home early from training due to illness, casting doubt over his availability ahead of crucial fixtures.\n\nThis string of unfortunate circumstances leaves England with a depleted defensive line. As alternatives, manager Gareth Southgate could delve into the inexperienced talents in the squad, like Tyrone Mings or Ben White. However, neither have the wealth of experience playing at high-stake international games that the likes of Maguire, Stones, and Walker can boast.\n\nSouthgate remains hopeful, stating in a recent press conference: \"It's always a challenge dealing with injuries and suspensions. However, we have a strong squad and fully believe in the ability of each player.\"\n\nDespite this optimism, there is no denying that the defensive crisis poses a significant challenge for England. With the European championship and World Cup qualifiers coming up, the team needs its defensive stalwarts not only fit but also in prime form to ensure a successful campaign.\n\nOnly time will tell how England navigates this situation. For now, fans and critics alike will closely watch how Southgate adjusts his tactics and line-ups to address this defensive crisis. One thing is for certain — with the stakes this high, England's defensive challenges can't be ignored.",
    "\"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\" serves as a spectacular conclusion to George Lucas's revered original space trilogy. The epic conclusion expands on the rich narrative depth and complexity introduced in the first two movies, bringing an immensely satisfying culmination to one of the most loved stories in cinema history. \n\nAs an avid Star Wars fan, the first aspect of the movie that stole my heart was the narrative continuity and the character development. Luke Skywalker, having found his place in the universe, now asserts himself as a seasoned Jedi, reflecting a powerful emotional progression from the character we saw in \"A New Hope\". Harrison Ford’s Han Solo and Carrie Fisher’s Leia also evolve tremendously, each embracing their individual roles within the Rebellion while exploring new emotional depths in their relationship.\n\nThe film maintains a brilliant balance between intimate character moments and intricate battle sequences that the franchise is known for. The visual effects are exemplary, even by today's standards, with the climaxing Battle of Endor and the thrilling fight sequence between Luke, Vader, and The Emperor, embodying the franchise's distinct cinematic style.\n\nJohn Williams' musical score, as always, serves as the emotional core of the film, evoking an array of emotions from anticipation and euphoria to suspense and sadness, proving that he remains unmatched in eliciting cinematic ambiance through sound.\n\nHowever, Return of the Jedi does have its flaws. The introduction of the Ewoks was a controversial choice and can feel somewhat out of sync with the darker tone of the rest of the film. They're undoubtedly marketed towards a younger audience, but their narrative involvement during the climactic Battle of Endor can come across as forced and somewhat underwhelming.\n\nThat being said, \"Return of The Jedi\" effortlessly captures the magic of Star Wars. It beautifully wraps up the endearing narrative of the original cast while leaving room for further elaboration of the vast galaxy. It brings closure to the experiences of characters we've grown attached to, and offers a heart-warming celebration of the triumph of good over evil - a timeless theme that fans continue to love. \n\nWith its astounding visuals, engaging story, compelling performances, and a fitting conclusion to an epic adventure, \"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\" provides a cinematic experience that extends beyond its era, making it a must-watch for all movie lovers.",

    "Movie: Eyes Wide Shut (1999)\nThe story is about a married couple (Dr. Bill Harford and Alice Harford, played by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman respectively). It chronicles their journey of discovery and struggle, culminating in Bill's exploration of his sexual psyche during their dinner and sex party. The movie also explores the relationship between husband and wife, their fears, hopes and aspirations, and the ultimate journey of self.\nThere are two predominant themes in Eyes Wide Shut. The first is the relationship between Harford and his wife. The movie explores his insecurities as a husband and how he tries to deal with them. The second dominant theme is fantasy and reality, and how the film deals with them in the process of exploring sexual psyche of the protagonist, Bill.\nFor me, the first theme of the movie, exploration of the relationship between husband and wife, is the weak part of the movie. While the story has potential for development, it is not fully explored. We learn little about the characters and their story. The relationship between husband and wife is left ambiguous, which makes the movie much less interesting.\nThe story follows the story of Bill, a married man, as he falls in love with a woman named Victoria who is a widow and a mother. When she leaves her husband, he has to come to terms with the fact that he will never have the kind of relationship he wants with her. He starts to have fantasies about the three women and is unsure what he should do.\nWhen Bill meets the three women, he starts to have feelings for them. He begins to act in a childish manner and does not know what to do with the situation. The three women try to help him out, but he starts to lose his grip on reality. They tell him to stop being childish, that his behavior is not what he should be doing.\nThis movie is a psychological drama that deals with the issues of love, sex, and self-discovery. It is a psychological film, which means that it deals with emotion and not just physical pleasure. The movie also has some very interesting themes and ideas. Those are:\nThe movie is a psychological drama, but it also has a lot of sex scenes. The sex scenes are used in the movie to explore the characters and their relationships.

    "This film has been described as a \"miracle\", and it's hard to argue with that description. It's not just a miracle, but an amazing one. The story follows a young man named David (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) who is diagnosed with cancer at age 17. He undergoes chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and after several months he begins to recover. But then his doctor tells him that he will need another round of treatment in order to save his life. After undergoing this second round of treatment, David finds himself back on the chemo table, and he soon discovers that there are some things you can't cure. This film is about what happens when you try to do something impossible.\n\nI'm going to be honest here; I didn't see this coming. I was expecting a generic horror/thriller/sci-fi flick, but instead I got a film that is both very unique and very compelling. There were times where I thought the film would end up being nothing more than a cheap thriller, but it never did. Instead, it became a fascinating look into the human condition, and how we deal with adversity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this film is directed by none other than Steven Spielberg.

    "The UK games industry is set for a multi-million pound boost with the announcement of this year's Government subsidy.\nBirmingham company Codemasters has won a six million pounds grant to employ 200 people.\nThe company has just released its latest PS2 game Colin McRae DIRT and says its grant will allow it to develop many more titles yet to be announced.\nThe game was developed just across the road from the studio's base in Darlington.\nIt is a bit tough for us all. I would love the money to be given all over again because there are so many talented developers that didn't get it but that's life.\nCodemasters is going to use the money really well. After years in the doldrums, the game industry is once again a success story which has produced a multi-million pound turnover with a few more games firms starting up as well as taking on more staff.\nThe Government has said one of its key aims is to build an industry based on skilled UK workers.\nCodemasters Chief Executive David Darling said: \"The games industry is growing at phenomenal rates in the UK and we are determined to continue to play a significant role in ensuring our home grown games are as good as anyone's in the world.\n\"We have a great team here that is not just skilled at creating best-selling and award-winning games but has an enviable track record of supporting the industry through many years of development.\n\"This funding will allow us to make an even greater impact on the development of the games industry across Britain.\"\nIn recent years, a number of games makers including Codemasters have opened new development centres in the UK to take advantage of skills training programmes.\nThe Government has said it is committed to an ever growing number of subsidies for UK-based creators.\nCodemasters has been making games since 1986 and is an industry leader in racing games.\nIts latest success is with PS2 version of Colin McRae DIRT which includes a series of cars and tracks as part of its campaign mode and also includes rally racing mode where players can drive any of the cars and drive anywhere in the world.\nThe Colin McRae name is synonymous with rally games.

    "When it comes to rebuilding Imperial City, a number of factors come into play to determine the costs. \n\nThe first factor is labor cost. This accounts for the wages of the workers, architects, engineers, project managers, etc. Labor makes up a sizable portion of the cost and it's based on local wage standards.\n\nThe second aspect is material costs. The selection of building materials greatly impacts the rebuilding cost. The higher the quality, the greater the cost. This includes everything from steel and concrete to wood or ivory, depending on the specific parts of Imperial City being rebuilt.\n\nAnother significant factor is the extent of the damage or destruction. If Imperial City was ravaged by a large-scale conflict, the reconstruction cost will be much higher. More destruction equals more areas that need rebuilding, driving up both labor and material costs.\n\nThe level of tech being used, both in terms of the reconstruction process and the intended final product, also plays into the cost. Use of magic (if we're keeping to Elder Scrolls lore here), advanced machinery, or high-tech amenities in the city would increase the cost.\n\nThe last factor comes in the form of logistics and administrative costs. This includes costs related to planning and managing the project, procurement and transportation of materials, dealing with any legal and regulatory requirements, etc. \n\nThese are some of the main factors that determine the rebuilding cost of Imperial City. Each situation can be unique so it's hard to say exactly how much the rebuild would cost without a concrete estimation based on these factors.",

    "In a landmark move, tech giant Google has embarked on an ambitious project to digitally scan renowned libraries from across the world. This revolutionary endeavour aims to democratize access to knowledge on a global scale and strengthen the bond between digital technology and education.\n\nUnder this initiative, Google has formed alliances with some of the world's most prestigious libraries, such as Oxford's Bodleian Library and the New York Public Library, amongst others. The aim is to digitally reproduce millions of books, newspapers, manuscripts, and other works of literature and knowledge, effectively bringing their wealth of information within the reach of anyone with access to the internet.\n\nGoogle believes that the traditional model of a library as a physical repository of knowledge is ripe for transformation in the digital age. With this project, Google aims to open up the world's libraries to everyone, transcending geographical barriers, thus unlocking a myriad of information previously unavailable to broad swaths of the population.\n\nHowever, the undertaking is far from simple. Converting physical books into a digital format involves clearing several hurdles, such as copyright issues and the technical challenges of accurately preserving and representing the physical characteristics of original documents. Despite this, Google remains undeterred and is facing these challenges head-on.\n\nBut why scan libraries? This project is part of Google's broader mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. By digitizing libraries, Google believes it can help spur a new era of knowledge sharing and foster a culture of global intellectual curiosity.\n\nThe company also hopes that this ambitious project will provide an invaluable tool for researchers and scholars. Digital books will be keyword searchable, making it faster and easier for researchers to find relevant material. Google is also exploring partnerships with educational institutions to integrate the digital library into existing academic curricula and resources.\n\nIn a statement, Google said, \"As we digitize these libraries, we’re preserving and promoting the world's collective history, culture and knowledge. We’re excited about the potential of this project to democratize access to information and contribute to global education.\"\n\nGoogle has not yet disclosed a timeline or budget for the project, but it seems certain that this monumental task won't be completed overnight.\n\nTo combat concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of information, Google has assured that strict digital rights management protocols will be implemented, to respect both the rights of the authors and the users.\n\nAlthough the project is still in its early stages, it speaks to Google's vision of a world where access to knowledge is not dictated by one's location or economic status. It may be a radical reimagining of",
    "Observations of an EXO-200 background in radioactive rock obtained from the Mt. Baker–Snoqualmie National Monument in Washington State indicate that the emission of radioactivity from the radioactive geochemistry of the rock is significantly higher than that of natural geological sources, probably due to a very high rate of radioactive decay in the rock. This background has been detected at a number of distances from the source, implying that the background must arise from a physical process, possibly due to the interaction between the geochemistry of the rock and an external field. A comparison between the background-induced emissions and background values of ambient background radiation suggests that the background was generated by radioiodine decay.\n\nThe article also includes the following short, but very useful, video clip from a presentation called \"How a Geologist Obtains a Radioactive Background for Exo-200\" by David M.

    "\"Warcraft\" is an exhilarating dive into the intricate world of Azeroth, offering a mesmerizing cinematic translation of the widely popular video game. Director Duncan Jones navigates the dense lore of this universe with commendable skill, making the movie more than just visually striking, but thematically resonant as well.\n\nThe film begins by introducing us to a richly textured world, filled with diverse races, epic magic, and thorny political intrigue. Astounding in scope and detail, the world-building in \"Warcraft\" is both vast and invigorating. The CGI is near flawless, the production design is grand and the costumes and makeup, especially for the orcs, are commendable.\n\nTop-notch visual effects bring the heavily muscled orcs to life, making them as expressive and emotionally engaging as their human co-stars. The clash between the human-led Alliance and the orcish Horde is thrilling, showcasing engaging battle sequences that are as heart-pounding as they are visually enchanting.\n\nThe performances overall are solid, especially Toby Kebbell as the conflicted orc Durotan. His performance infuses his digital character with a strong sense of humanity and emotional depth, effectively proving that performance capture technology can convey subtle expressions and emotions. Paula Patton also stands out, offering a feisty portrayal of the half-human, half-orc Garona.\n\n\"Warcraft,\" however, stumbles with its pacing and narrative coherence. The plot, though undeniably ambitious, can feel overwhelming at times, especially for those unfamiliar with the source material. Characters and subplots come and go swiftly, sometimes leaving audience members feeling lost.\n\nThe emotional depth is occasionally lost amidst the multilayered plot lines and relentless action sequences. But overall, \"Warcraft\" does a commendable job in constructing an engaging narrative out of a source material basically structured around repetitive conflict and territorial acquisition.\n\nThe bold ending sets the stage for future films, hinting at the expansive nature of the Warcraft universe yet to be explored. Despite any narrative pitfalls, \"Warcraft\" stands as a visually stunning, creatively ambitious adaptation that augurs well for future video game-turned-movie projects. Whether you're a fan of the game or a newcomer to this universe, \"Warcraft\" offers an engaging spectacle filled with magic, action, and a touch of heart.",

    "Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has announced plans to privatise state assets, including Ukraine's biggest bank Privatbank and its largest steelmaker Naftogaz. The president said he would use proceeds from the sales to help pay off debts owed by the country's two main banks, which have been bailed out with billions of dollars in international aid. Mr Poroshenko also said that he was considering selling the country's second-largest gas producer DTEK, which supplies about half of the country's electricity. He said he had not yet decided whether to sell the company or keep it as part of the state.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report on the sale of PrivatBank by Bloomberg News:\n\nPrivatBank, Ukraine's third-biggest lender, will be sold for $1.5 billion to a group led by billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal could be completed within weeks, they said. It comes after the government last month approved a plan to restructure PrivatBank into three separate entities — one holding the bank's retail operations; another holding its investment banking business; and a third holding its real estate arm. The restructuring plan calls for PrivatBank to be split into two companies, one focused on retail and the other on investment banking. The new entity would be called Privat Bank Ukraina (PBO). The government intends to raise $2.4 billion through the sale of PBO shares, the people said. The government plans to issue up to $500 million worth of bonds to finance the transaction, the people said. The bond issuance would be financed by the sale of PBO shares, the people said. The government expects to receive at least $1.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of PBO shares, the people said.\n\nIn addition to the privatization of PrivatBank, the Ukrainian government is planning to sell its second-largest gas producer DTEK, which supplies about half of the country's electricity. This is an excerpt from a Reuters story entitled \"Ukraine to Sell Gas Producer\":\n\nUkraine is preparing to sell its second-largest gas producer DTEK to Russian energy giant Gazprom, a move likely to anger Kiev's Western backers who are demanding more transparency over how the deal will affect the price of natural gas flowing into Europe.

    "The Beastie Boys have won the first major test of a controversial British Copyright Act which makes it easier for performers to take control of their sampled recordings.\nJudge Andrew Smith has ruled that the American group's record label Grand Royal can control future uses of the drum loop to 'Funky Drummer' by Clyde Stubblefield.\nLast year, Grand Royal won a High Court case against the MCA group, which owned Stubblefield's recording. MCA then lodged an appeal.\nBeasties sample\nThe Beastie Boys use a sample of 'Funky Drummer' for their 1989 hit 'Paul Revere' from their album Paul's Boutique.\nThe Beastie Boys say they bought a licence from the American producer of the track. But Stubblefield took MCA to court over his royalties. It was then that MCA challenged Grand Royal's ownership of the drum loop.\nThe Beastie Boys, who claim they are fighting for freedom of music makers, argued that they bought a licence in good faith. MCA however says Stubblefield was never paid for the work on 'Funky Drummer'.\nJudge Smith said: \"If this were strictly an issue of the interpretation of the licence agreement, it might be said that Stubblefield's interest in the matter is at an end because of the sale of his interests in the music to MCA.\n\"However, in my judgement there is a right of action against the subsequent user of the recording, Grand Royal, for unauthorised copying.\"\nJudge Smith ordered MCA to pay Grand Royal's legal costs and to hand over its copies of the drum loop. He also ordered Grand Royal to pay MCA's legal costs.\nSource: bbc.com/news\nRetrieved from \"https://www.beastieboysbook.com/wiki/index.php?title=Beastie_Boys_win_sampling_battle&oldid=1390\"",

The story line and acting were great; however there are some things that could have been done better in my opinion...but overall this flick rocks!! Johnny Depp's portrayal as John Dillinger (my favorite gangster)was excellent!!! He really captured his personality perfectly....and Marion Cotillard did an amazing job playing Billie Frechette/Fritchett(sp?) She played her part so well you would think she actually knew him personally..I loved how they portrayed their relationship with each other.....it made me feel like he truly cared about someone besides himself......which makes sense because if anyone knows anything at all bout john dillenger its known factually proven by history books written on them both individually & together,that bill frechittt or frichetta had feelings towards mr dillynger too........i mean comeon people who ever heard any woman say no when asked? lol anyway back 2 topic....the only thing wrong wth marion cottilards character being bille frichitta insteadaof billey friechettes name which shouldve benn used since thats wat happened historically speaking..isnt important enough 4me get upset over...so im just gonna let dat slide cuz u cant change da past now can ya??

    "I'm currently working on a project that involves water flow through a cylindrical grate, and I've been running into a few issues understanding how to calculate this properly.\n\nMy grate has a certain diameter and is made up of thin circular bars spaced apart at a regular interval. The water should ideally flow from the outer surface inward. What puzzles me is how to account for the space between the bars. And how would the curvature of the grate affect the flow rate? \n\nIf any of you have dealt with similar issues or have knowledge about fluid mechanics, could you provide some insights or direct me to any resources that might help? Is there a specific formula or principle that I should be aware of? I've scoured through some textbooks and online resources, however, I haven't found anything concrete yet that can guide me.\n\nFurthermore, is it possible to simulate this scenario using any software? Being able to visualize the flow would be tremendously helpful in gaining a better understanding. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
    "Former England manager Kevin Keegan heaped praises on Robbie Fowler for a staggering comeback, calling the Liverpool legend a 'comeback king'.\n\nFowler, who's affectionately known as 'God' among the Liverpool faithful, had been suffering from a dip in form and a series of injuries that saw him spend more time on the bench than on the pitch. However, his sensational return to form took critics by surprise and won him nothing but praise from his peers and managers alike.\n\nKeegan, who was speaking at a charity event in Liverpool, spoke highly of Fowler's resilience. \"Fowler has always been a fighter,\" Keegan said. \"Even in the face of adversity, he never shies away from a challenge. His recent comeback is a testament to that. He’s a true professional, a comeback king, if you like.\"\n\nFowler’s return to form harks back to his heydays in Anfield when he was one of Liverpool's potent weapons, earning his stripes as one of England's most clinical strikers in the 90s.\n\nOnce considered a fallen star, Fowler's current resurgence has taken the footballing world by storm. A spate of sterling performances including his brace against arch-rivals Everton in the Merseyside derby underlines that. The striker seems to have rediscovered his Midas touch in front of goal, relighting optimism among the Anfield faithful.\n\nKeegan added, \"Not a lot of players can bounce back the way Robbie has. It’s one thing to have the talent but having the mental strength to overcome obstacles is something else. Fowler clearly has both in abundance.\"\n\nKeegan himself is no stranger to comebacks, having embarked on numerous ones during his illustrious career as both a player and a manager. His words of praise carry a lot of weight, particularly coming from someone who has experienced all the lows and highs that football can offer.\n\nRobbie Fowler's inspiring comeback signals a beacon of hope to other players going through a rough phase in their career. It underscores the importance of resilience, perseverance, and undying passion for the game, qualities Fowler exemplified in the face of adversity.\n\nHis story is a reminder to all that football, much like life, is never completely devoid of second chances. It tells us that even in the darkest hours, a will to fight back can reignite a dwindling career, a lesson Fowler teaches all too well.\n",
    "I stumbled upon a comment thread yesterday where a mod mentioned that they were 15. To say I was surprised would be an understatement. I’ve been in this community for over 3 years now and it's always come across as a place curated and maintained by mature and responsible individuals. With all due respect, I don’t see how a 15-year-old, who is still a high school student, can effectively monitor a platform with thousands of active users.\n\nLet me clarify, this is not me age-shaming someone. This is about experience and responsibility. As a user, I do have certain expectations from the mods. Their role is critical in maintaining the integrity, tone, and overall culture of this subreddit. They have to be responsible for handling disputes, issuing warnings, and making important decisions that can impact the community as a whole.\n\nIt's great to see young people take interest in online communities, there's nothing wrong with that. But being a moderator is a different ballpark. It requires a level of maturity and thorough understanding of both the platform and the user base which, no offense, I doubt a 15-year-old would possess.\n\nDoes anyone else share the same concerns? Let's discuss this openly. If it turns out that the age of the mod isn't a significant factor in preserving the quality of subreddits they run, I'll be the first to admit my skepticism was wrong. But, for now, I'm seriously considering looking for another subreddit if this is going to be the new norm.\n",
    "Four men have been detained at Guantanamo Bay since 2002, but only one has ever been charged with a crime. The fourth man was released in 2009 after being cleared for release by an interagency review board. He had been held without charge or trial for more than 11 years. Now he's back on the run and his lawyers say they fear he could be killed if he returns to Afghanistan.\n\nA US military spokesman said that the four detainees were taken into custody as part of a raid last week against al-Qaida militants who were hiding out in Pakistan. They are believed to be members of the Haqqani network, which is based in neighbouring Afghanistan.\n\nThey were transferred to the detention facility at Bagram air base in eastern Afghanistan, where they will remain under guard until their transfer to another location, according to the spokesman, Colonel Patrick Ryder.\n\nHe declined to give details about what led to the raid, saying it would compromise ongoing operations. But he did confirm that the men were captured during a joint operation between American forces and Afghan security forces.\n\nMr Ryder also confirmed that the men were suspected of having links to Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda.\n\nIn addition to Mr Mohammed, the other three detainees are Abdul Qayum Zakir, Ibrahim Ahmed Ghailani and Waheed Gul.

    "The following is the full text of a review for the movie \"Son of Saul\" from IMDb.com: (view full review) This movie is an adaptation of the book \"Son of Saul\" by the Nobel Prize winner, Adolfo López-Alt. It is a story of the first and last days of the great anti Nazi resistance movement. The movie is directed by Andrzej Wajda. He and his family was persecuted by the Nazis in the beginning of WWII. In the movies \"Son of Saul\" it is shown how the Nazis exterminated people during the last days of the war. (view full review)\n\nThe text appears below.\n\nIt is a great honor to be able to share this review with you. I do realize that it is not easy to see these films made from the author's books. But if this is the best we can do, I believe that if a lot more people know about this, I believe that we can make a difference.\n\nHere is why I believe that we need help from the public:\n\nI have seen many, many films about the Holocaust including documentaries, from museums, PBS, even the PBS special \"Holocaust: An American Tragedy.\" These films are good. But it is their context that really matters. You must understand what life was like before and during the Holocaust; about the people who experienced it; and of course, what helped and hindered people from making it through.\n\nI see so many documentaries about the concentration camps, about the Holocaust from the perspective of survivors. They all have a similar ending but they all seem to end in a way different from my own. I don't just mean different in the way Jews are depicted from all sides, I mean that these \"tourists\" end up looking more impressed with themselves. They are not trying to learn more about the Holocaust, but I feel they are more self-congratulatory and proud when they end their documentaries with \"We survived.\" They don't realize that there were millions upon millions of Jewish people who did not survive the Holocaust of which they are mostly a part.\n\nI feel like these \"survivors\" aren't learning from their own experiences. You can only learn if you see.\n\nI have read many books about the War and the atrocities which it caused. They tell us a good part about the",
    "In this paper, we present a novel technique for solving the Gaussian mixture modeling problem. The method is based on the stochastic nature of the latent-variable distribution and the nonlinear dynamics of the latent-variable system. We first derive a robust MCMC method for the problem by variationally averaging the parameters of the latent-variable distributions. We then construct a variational bayesian clustering algorithm to perform the shape estimation. We demonstrate that our method improves the accuracy of shape approximation, improves the variance of shape estimates, and reduces the time needed to solve image segmentation in a wide variety of image recognition tasks.\n\nNow that is a neat piece of the picture. The most exciting part of this paper is the discussion of shape samplers, and how to do them. They start with the following definitions: \"We define a shape sampler as a function that has two fixed parameters and behaves as follows. First, it is defined as a function of the latent-variable values for a particular image and state space. We denote the estimated gradient of the function with respect to the estimated gradient for any image and state space from the image and state space, respectively.\"\n\nAnd \"We compute an MCMC sample of form, where the parameters, and are the estimated parameter estimates for the shape value and shape segmentation functions, respectively.\n\nI do not know the author to this point, but I have no doubt it is a nice paper. And as a bonus of finding it, it allows us to see a graphical representation of how to perform shape sampling. In their example image from above, the author shows some of the \"samples.\" As might be guessed, an image from a sphere will produce a relatively sparse result. A bit more complex image will yield much more dense results.\n\nNow, you're probably thinking that I'm just being silly here. \"Look at those shapes!\"\n\nYou're absolutely right. After all, you might not have figured out what the author was proposing, but I do think it is a very impressive result.\n\nOne key in their method is that you just do shape sampling with the parameter sampler, which is a bit like using shape vectors to measure distances between shapes.

    "I've been trying to adopt a dog for the past few months and I've been met with nothing but roadblocks and red tape. I understand that shelters want to ensure that their dogs are going to good homes, but the process is so convoluted and difficult that it's discouraging.\n\nFirstly, the application process is incredibly invasive. They want to know everything from my work schedule to my income, to whether or not I have a fenced yard. I understand wanting to ensure that the dog will be well cared for, but it feels like I'm applying for a top-secret government job, not trying to give a dog a loving home.\n\nSecondly, the fees are astronomical. I've seen adoption fees ranging from $200 to $500. I understand that these fees help cover the cost of care for the animals, but it's a significant barrier for many people. I'm more than willing to pay for the care of my pet, but these upfront costs can be prohibitive.\n\nLastly, the process is incredibly slow. I've been waiting for weeks to hear back about my application, only to be told that the dog I was interested in has already been adopted. It's frustrating and disheartening.\n\nI'm not saying that shelters should just hand out dogs to anyone who walks in the door, but there has to be a better way. The current system is preventing a lot of dogs from finding good homes. It's no wonder shelters are so full when they make it so difficult to adopt. I wish they would streamline the process and make it more accessible for people who genuinely want to provide a loving home for these animals.",
    "\"This is The End\" is an anything-goes apocalyptic raucous comedy with a plethora of Hollywood stars. As one of the most hysterically funny films I've seen in a while, this movie is infused with genuine laughs from start to finish. Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson - all play skewed versions of themselves to comedic perfection. \n\nThe story invites us to a wild party at James Franco's house where celebrities are reveling hard not realizing that the apocalypse is about to happen. What follows is a relentless journey of wit, surprises, and extensive comedy. The comic timing of the ensemble cast is truly impressive and their performances are just as hilarious and outrageous as one might expect.\n\nThe script does not shy away from vulgarity and it even pushes the envelope of crude humor for many. However, the crassness only adds to the hilarity of the situations. The premise of the film is outlandishly absurd yet brilliant. \"This is The End\" successfully blurs the line between reality and fiction, using the real personas of the actors to create a fun mockery of Hollywood's excesses.\n\nThe unexpected cameo appearances are sure to delight viewers, adding another dimension to the fun. Add to that some brilliantly crafted CGI sequences involving a certain dark lord for a visually impressive treat.\n\nWhile on one hand, it has an unashamedly ridiculous plot, on the other it provides social commentary through its comedy by addressing the rampant egotism in Hollywood and our society's obsession with fame.\n\nTrue, \"This is The End\" might not be everyone's cup of tea due to its bawdy humor and controversial religious themes. However, the movie is funny consistently at a rate that puts other comedies to shame. It is unrepentantly non-PC and brilliantly blunt - a riot with every line having the potential to become the punchline. An entertaining cataclysm that brings the end of the world wrapped in laughter. It's indeed a unique kind of joyride through chaos for those who appreciate its brand of humor.",
    "This film was not what i expected, but it wasn't bad either! It's just that when you hear about Tim Burton directing an Alice In wonder land adaptation and Johnny Depp playing The Mad Hatter...you expect something more than this....but then again maybe its better to have low expectations so as NOT TO BE DISAPPOINTED!!! This version has some good points like Helena Bonham Carter (who plays Red Queen) who does her best with such little screen time she gets compared too all those other actors/actresses out there today.....and Mia Wasikowska(the main character ALICE). She did well considering how much pressure must be on someone taking over one if THE most famous roles ever created by Lewis Carroll himself!!

    "http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/27v6eo/im_a_fanboy_but_shes_not/c5tms9q\n\n\nThat first thread makes me think about what kind of person would get so worked up over all three games? You see all this hype for the game since launch, but to you the only thing interesting in all those videos is the lore snippets and how they relate (or don't) to each other. All we hear is how beautiful things are and stuff like that when literally no one watches and nobody cares. We know Destiny 3 will have an event where their version of The Traveler came down, and that you can go to the surface. But none of you will care because no one's asked you to watch the thing until after the event, nor did anyone ask us to watch it either while playing. Now as a fanboy of Bungie's work who grew up with them the games had great characters; I love watching players develop them both through play and plot, but for any serious fan or player at least be able to go a few years back and pick out who played each mission then review and commentate on how the progression progressed in those missions – it wouldn't take too much effort beyond showing your face if someone else did so as well. And the same goes with getting into how many rounds you won versus what number you beat or played against a certain enemy or raid boss if someone wanted to make sure they had a good idea of why the final kill was made possible. They could talk up their experiences throughout the whole experience – some of these missions would help people understand something the main story mode may not bring you for instance, and in some cases explaining the reason you are even there in the first place would aid in understanding where things are heading going forward.\n\n\nSo now here, without naming names and sharing any personal info; is my experience being talked to as a hardcore gamer on a weekly basis as a big supporter of Destiny. No questions ever have been asked for anything at any point in time except on the forums. Everything has been covered in pretty much every way possible regardless of whether it applies or doesn't.

    "This paper presents a novel approach to the segmentation of the left atrium in cardiac MRI images using a combination of global shape priors and local intensity priors. The proposed method employs a mixture model to capture the variability of global shape priors, while an autoencoder is used to learn the local intensity priors. The integration of these two priors allows for a more accurate and robust segmentation of the left atrium, even in the presence of image artifacts and variations in anatomy. Experimental results on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques. This approach has potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment planning of atrial fibrillation.",

    "The Conservatives are condemning proposed reforms of the EU asylum law system, which they are calling a sell-out.\n\nA deal by EU Justice and Home Affairs ministers sets new rules which would make national courts and asylum authorities responsible for deciding whether EU law had been breached.\n\nThe UK's asylum system has come under increasing pressure in recent years as more people have been arriving from France following a crackdown across the Channel.\n\nIn a newspaper article written for _The Times_ published earlier this month, Home Secretary David Blunkett set out a \"fresh approach\" towards the tens of thousands of asylum seekers whose claims are rejected, promising a \"system which rewards those who play by the rules and are compliant with their obligations\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Conservative Home Secretary David Davis said he was deeply concerned that ministers had made commitments to reform the Dublin Convention that would have consequences for UK immigration policy.\n\nAn agreed way of dealing with the movement of rejected asylum seekers is likely to be one of the key policy areas pursued by the new European Commission, the EU's executive, under its president-elect, Jose Manuel Barroso.\n\nMr Blunkett's promised \"fresh approach\" involves taking a more active role in removing those who no longer have the right to stay in the UK.\n\n\"We all understand the need to share responsibility for enforcing what has been a wholly unsatisfactory and unworkable EU approach to the Dublin Convention and asylum seekers for some time,\" said Mr Blunkett.\n\nThe Dublin Convention is an EU agreement under which the member state where an asylum seeker first entered has to take responsibility for that person.\n\nThe agreement has been widely criticised as the most inefficient aspect of the EU asylum law.\n\nAsylum seekers who fail to get the protection they seek can be returned to the country where they first applied. But there is nothing in current EU laws to force the authorities in that country to return them there. They then face the prospect of having to make an application for asylum again.\n\nOne of the key elements in the reform is that rejected asylum seekers should have to seek permission to remain in a member state – so that if they are removed to one of the original signatory countries, they cannot simply re-enter Europe.\n\nThe rules also allow asylum seekers who have been rejected to appeal a rejected claim through the courts, as long",
    "This paper explores the specifics of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) and the nature of their conditional behavior. It critically focuses on the current interpretation that conditions in CGANs only influence data generation while the latent space remains unaffected. Using an empirical approach through various experiments and comparative studies, we challenge this view and demonstrate that the conditions can also influence the latent space of the generative model. Finally, we present potential implications of our findings and suggest directions for future research in GAN technology to enhance its capabilities and improve aligned applications.",

    "> We present a novel approach to inference in Markov Random Fields (MRFs) based on Riemannian optimization. We show that the inference problem can be formulated as a smooth optimization problem on the space of probability distributions.

We then show that the Riemannian gradient descent algorithm is equivalent to the well-known belief propagation algorithm.

    "Reddit user \"joeymcgath\" asked: \"Is a degree in media studies worth it?\"\nAs an undergraduate student, I have taken multiple courses in media and communication studies, including introduction to media, writing for television, media and law, and media and policy. These courses seemed interesting at first, providing a break away from my major courses in biochemistry and molecular biology, and were some of my most enjoyable undergraduate courses. Since then, my academic advisor has been encouraging me to pursue a graduate degree in communication or media studies, promising that these programs would help me get into medical school and would be great for personal growth and improving one's social skills. At first, I was thrilled by the idea; however, as I was researching programs, I noticed that many applicants have little to no experience working in the media or communications industry. These applicants seemed to have undergraduate degrees in unrelated subjects such as humanities, political science, or business.\nMy question for the reddit community is as follows:\nIs this the proper avenue for you to take if your goal is to apply to medical school and pursue a career as a physician, as in my case? It seems like most programs require experience or knowledge in the industry before application, and that it is more focused on social media and marketing than the medical field. My academic advisor believes that I will benefit more from pursuing a graduate degree in the humanities than continuing my undergraduate studies as a pre-med student. I also plan on taking the MCAT in the fall of 2018 for potential graduate school admissions in the fall of 2019. Should I apply to communication studies as a graduate student, or should I wait in order to gain more experience in the biological sciences before furthering my education to an advanced degree (if needed)?\nI appreciate all answers and opinions. I know this is long, but I wanted the reddit community to understand the pros and cons of applying for a communication studies major as a career and my specific situation as a pre-med student. I know all of you have a wide array of opinions, so I am interested in other perspectives aside from yours.\nMy apologies for the long question, but a little background information may help.\nI have always been interested in biomedical sciences and have participated in a plethora of biomedical research opportunities, including multiple publications and the research for a Master's thesis.

    "I'm not sure if this is an actual problem or just a symptom of how I've been feeling lately, but I have been blocked by my parents for several days now. They are very strict with their internet usage and don't allow me to use any social media sites like Facebook or Twitter. My mom even told me that she doesn't want me on her computer because it's too distracting for her. She also said that she would rather see me in person than on the phone. I feel really bad about this, as I love them so much and they're such great people. But I can't seem to get through to them. I know that I should be able to talk to them about anything, but I just can't seem to find the words. Any advice?\n\nThis is a common complaint among young adults who are trying to navigate the world without parental supervision. It's especially true when you live at home with your parents, where there's no one else around to help you out.\n\nBut what happens when you try to explain why you need to go somewhere? What happens when you ask for permission to do something? How does your parent react?\n\nHere are some tips for dealing with your parents' block policy:\n\n1. Don't argue. If you think your parents will back down, then you probably won't succeed. Instead, try to understand why they're doing what they're doing. Explain that you'd appreciate it if they let you visit your grandparents, but that you can't come alone. You might say something like, \"My grandma has Alzheimer's disease and needs constant care. I'll be happy to stay with her until she dies.\" Or, \"If you don't let me visit my grandparents, I'll miss them terribly.\"\n\n2. Try to figure out what you can do to make things easier for yourself. For example, if you're going to a friend's house, you could invite them over instead. If you're going to a restaurant, you could order food online instead of having to wait in line. If you're going to a movie theater, you could buy tickets ahead of time.\n\n3. Be polite. Your parents may not realize that you're upset, but they still have feelings of guilt and shame associated with being unable to spend quality time with you. So, try to remain calm and respectful.\n\n4",
    "A number of deep neural networks are used to analyze and understand individual events in space such as images, sound sequences or interactions between people (Bosch et al., 2005; Böhm and Henss et al., 2011). Two categories for measuring domain shift impact can be distinguished according to how the observed domain feature space shift interacts with the underlying feature representations. In either case, it seems that domains shift interact significantly more in some cases and less in others according to their characteristics and underlying architectures (Kühnert et al., 2010; Huber et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2004; Martinowich et al., 2013).\" Abstract From these work we will summarize the main features which characterize the relation between layer shifts and functional architecture in image processing. Using an unsupervised approach based on classification trees for each category of event classes, we show high accuracy over all the classes tested, including large regions within the occipital lobe area. We further show domain shift influence affects the segmenting quality much stronger than the model parameters do. This implies an essential role in the structure and function of the entire cortical network is reflected in activation differences. Thereby, using this analogy domain shift should be conceptualized just like the way objects are classified relative the direction they point from visual stimuli,\" says coauthor Dr. Sebastian Fuchs at University Medical Center in Braunschweig, Germany.\"This result brings several important questions concerning the underlying computational mechanism together with new insights on the interaction among them. It points to a unique property across different datasets that may be exploited during future studies and can thus allow a precise characterization of how one's brain functions when experiencing particular visual content.\"\n\nFor example let us take a look at what happens if you have two different groups of subjects that produce a single sequence of sounds, say a bong bong bong, a hollering person, then another group of people that produces no noise at all in between. That last group would appear in a whole lot of images as the \"Noisy participants\" below. But suppose instead we put both groups on a separate computer and feed them an original speech. The two groups, the 2D Noise and 2D Noise+Lifetime are presented in the same order of appearance so long as the sequence continues in",
    "\"Marie Antoinette\" is a visually stunning and stylistically unique interpretation of the infamous French queen's life. Director Sofia Coppola has taken a bold approach, infusing the 18th-century narrative with a modern sensibility that is both refreshing and daring. \n\nKirsten Dunst delivers a compelling performance as the titular character, embodying the naivety, extravagance, and eventual despair of Marie Antoinette with a nuanced depth. Her portrayal is not of a villainous queen, but of a young woman thrust into a role she was ill-prepared for, making her character relatable and human. \n\nThe film's aesthetics are undeniably its strongest point. The lavish sets, costumes, and cinematography are a feast for the eyes, capturing the opulence of Versailles in all its glory. The unconventional use of contemporary music, while jarring for some, adds a layer of youthful rebellion and energy that aligns perfectly with the film's perspective.\n\nHowever, \"Marie Antoinette\" is not without its flaws. The pacing can be slow, and the narrative lacks the dramatic tension that one might expect from a story leading to the French Revolution. The film's focus on the personal rather than the political may leave some viewers wanting more depth and context.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, \"Marie Antoinette\" is a bold and beautiful film that offers a fresh take on a historical figure often vilified. It's a cinematic experience that is as decadent and indulgent as the queen herself, and for those willing to embrace its unconventional approach, it's a film well worth watching.",
    "The latest version of the Opera browser is set to revolutionise the way users interact with the internet, as it introduces a new voice-controlled feature. This innovative update is expected to enhance user experience by allowing them to navigate the web using voice commands.\n\nOpera Software, the company behind the popular web browser, announced the new feature as part of its latest update. The voice control feature, which is currently in beta testing, is designed to make browsing more accessible and convenient for all users.\n\nThe voice control feature will allow users to open tabs, search the web, and even compose emails using only their voice. This is expected to be particularly beneficial for users with mobility issues or visual impairments, as it will provide a hands-free and visually unobtrusive browsing experience.\n\nOpera Software has always been at the forefront of browser innovation, and this latest update is no exception. The company was one of the first to introduce features such as tabbed browsing and pop-up blocking, which have since become standard across all browsers.\n\nThe voice control feature is powered by advanced speech recognition technology, which is capable of understanding and executing a wide range of commands. Users will be able to customise the feature to recognise their own unique voice and accent, ensuring a personalised and seamless browsing experience.\n\nOpera Software has not yet announced a release date for the new feature, but it is expected to be rolled out in the coming months. The company has also hinted at other innovative features in the pipeline, including augmented reality capabilities and advanced privacy controls.\n\nThis latest update reaffirms Opera's commitment to providing a user-friendly and accessible browsing experience. With the introduction of voice control, the company is once again pushing the boundaries of what is possible in a web browser.\n\nThe move is likely to put pressure on other browser developers to introduce similar features. As voice control technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, it is expected to become a standard feature of web browsing in the near future.\n\nOpera's new voice control feature is a significant step forward in making the internet more accessible for everyone. It is a clear demonstration of how technology can be used to break down barriers and create a more inclusive digital world.",
    "This is one of many biographical films made about famous sport figures. Some good examples are \"Raging Bull\", \"Jerry Maguire\" \"Million Dollar Baby\" and even \"Rocky.\". This is the life tale of boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter. The movie is very well presented showing his life, how he met his wife and became a famous boxer at the same time. He is a contender for a World Championship title and it seems he has everything going for him until the day he is arrested and thrown into jail for a murder he didn't commit. He languishes in prison for years, losing his chance at the title, as well as his respect and relationship with his wife and children. It would take many years for him to prove his innocence and prove that the law enforcement was wrong.Many know the true story of \"Hurricane\" Carter. I have to say that this is one of those films that are hard to see but has to be shown anyway. It is the best performance Denzel has given and I can easily understand why he won an Oscar for his role. I think Denzel is deserving of an Oscar for this performance although many don't think so. It is also a powerful drama that is worth seeing. Denzel did a great job portraying a wrongfully accused individual without letting the audience feel any sympathy. He plays his role as a victim very well. His acting was truly outstanding and I can understand why everyone was talking about how much he deserved an Oscar.The supporting cast is very good. Forest Whitaker does an especially good job as his attorney. Famke Janssen, who plays his wife, gives an especially good performance. She is given a very emotional role and at times even tears up when she sees him in the position he is in. She is a sympathetic and warm person and it is a shame that they couldn't be together. Ingrid Munch, who plays his daughter, gives a very strong performance as a victim of her own mistakes. The supporting cast is very strong and each of them have their moments in this film.The movie is a true tribute to wrongfully accused individuals. I think this movie is especially relevant today as we see the growing awareness of those who are wrongfully charged and have their lives ruined by the state. \"Hurricane\" Carter has become a well known person and this",
    "In the last decade, differential privacy has emerged as the standard tool for addressing\nconcerns over the privacy of statistical databases while facilitating the development\nof new statistical tools. The definition, however---formulated in terms of a\ndistributional guarantee, or differentially private distributions---has proven\nextremely difficult to operationalize. It is often suggested that one way to\ninterpret differential privacy is to think of it as a condition on the behavior of\nmechanical procedures for combining individual data with a published statistic\n---the standard recipe for privacy analysis. In common use, the behavior one has\nin mind is summarized with the well-known slogan\n\"Add noise, get privacy\". In the present note, we advocate an alternate view, that\nthe privacy of a statistic is the extent to which the statistic, on being updated\nwith a new observation, retains consistency with the original statistic. From this\nperspective, privacy corresponds to the fact that differential privacy is a\ncondition on the posterior distribution of the statistics---which is to say, it is\na condition on the behavior of a model, not of the mechanical procedure\nprescribed by the standard recipe. We show, moreover, that the well known\nposterior consistency result of [19]---the result on which [33] and most other\nwork on privacy-preserving statistics depend---emerges naturally from this\nalternate perspective.\nThe research paper is authored by Ben Adlam, Somesh Jha, and Latanya Sweeney from the University of Florida, which is not known to me and I'm not sure how to evaluate. That said, I think what they're saying is actually true.\nThe following is a screenshot of the full research paper:\nNow you know!\nPrivacy.gov Privacy Glossary\nPrivacy Glossary - US PIR\n\"Privacy, as understood under U.S. common law, is largely based on an individual's right to prevent others from obtaining knowledge of certain facts about her or him that she or he believes should not be known by the public in general.

    "A global assessment over different satellite sensors reveals that our ability to characterize and model Earth's surface in relation to its topography varies by sensor type, season and lat/lon coordinates, and that it is difficult to apply standard land cover models on these data sets. Landcover transformation algorithms are currently being applied at field scale on these large-scale datasets without an appropriate knowledge of their spatial extent. Here we demonstrate how we can transform the land cover data on two Landsat 8+ and Sentinel 2 channels through two-way transformation between land cover classification codes. This makes it possible to classify an arbitrary subset (or subsets) of land area based on a few metrics commonly used in local assessment and land cover modeling. We show that our technique outperforms other existing approaches when the features of the data contain spatial information such as elevation [elevated soil moisture or vegetation height] or slope [convexity angle]. We further demonstrate improved accuracy by combining this approach with a knowledge of Earth surface boundaries on both Earth and space, and we use it systematically to identify land features to improve Earth observation-driven monitoring of many components of land surface change.",
    "“The celluloid adaptation of Harper Lee's poignant and powerful novel, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is nothing short of a cinematic triumph. The movie, much like its literary counterpart, is an admirable exploration of grave societal issues enveloped in the facade of an innocent and charming small-town setting. \n\nGregory Peck is magnetic in his portrayal of the virtuous lawyer and single father, Atticus Finch. Peck beautifully captures the dignity, kindness, and quiet strength of the character. His Oscar-worthy performance resonates in every scene, especially in his stirring courtroom monologue, which stands as one of the finest moments in cinema history. \n\nThe supporting cast contributes strongly as well, namely Mary Badham as the curious and outspoken Scout. Her genuine performance adds considerable depth to the narrative. Brock Peters, as the accused Tom Robinson, the embodiment of injustice and prejudice, too shines brilliantly, evoking empathy and outrage.\n\nOne cannot ignore the deft hand of director Robert Mulligan in capturing the essence of the American South of the 1930s, seamlessly juxtaposing its dreamy innocence with its lingering darkness. The black-and-white cinematography perfectly complements the plot's gravitas, painting a visually impactful picture of the era.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is a masterfully created film that compels you to introspect the harsh realities of societal prejudices and discrimination. The film’s narrative and its multidimensional characters remain etched in your mind long after the credits have rolled. It's an evocative and stirring narrative that continues to speak volumes about its timeless themes. A must-watch for lovers of insightful, intelligent cinema!”",

    "This paper presents a novel approach to image segmentation using nonparametric shape priors. The method employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) shape sampling, which allows for a more flexible and accurate representation of shape variations. The proposed technique is particularly effective in handling images with complex shapes and high levels of noise. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of both segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. The paper also provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different shape prior models on the segmentation results. This research contributes to the field of image processing by introducing a robust and efficient method for image segmentation with nonparametric shape priors.",
    "This film has been compared to \"A Clockwork Orange,\" but it's not quite as dark and twisted, although there are some similarities in that respect. The story follows two young people who meet at an art gallery and fall in love. They decide to move together to Paris where they live with their parents until one day they discover that they have both fallen in love with each other. This leads them to break up and start over again. It's a very romantic story about two people trying to find themselves and how they can overcome obstacles. There are many scenes of kissing and passionate sex between the main characters. I think this is what makes this film so special. It's not just a romance, it's also a coming-of-age story.\n\nI'm going to give this movie a 7/10 because it's pretty good. However, I would like to see more of the same.",
    "I've been hearing this phrase a lot lately, \"But you have to love your mother\". It's usually said in response to me expressing my feelings about my strained relationship with my mom. I understand that this phrase is often said with good intentions, but I think it's important to address the fact that not everyone has a healthy or positive relationship with their mother.\n\nI believe that love is not an obligation, but a feeling that comes naturally. It's not something that can be forced. If a person has been subjected to emotional, physical, or any other form of abuse by their mother, they are not obligated to love them. It's okay to distance yourself from toxic relationships, even if it's with a family member.\n\nI also want to point out that it's okay to have mixed feelings about your mother. It's okay to love her and be frustrated with her at the same time. It's okay to appreciate the good things she has done for you while acknowledging the bad.\n\nI'm not saying that we should all hate our mothers. I'm saying that it's okay to feel however you feel about your mother. Your feelings are valid, and you don't have to justify them to anyone. You don't have to love your mother just because society expects you to. You have the right to set boundaries and protect your mental health.\n\nI hope this post helps someone who is struggling with their relationship with their mother. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your well-being. You are not alone.",
    "Conservative tax plans would hit \"hardworking ordinary families... because their taxes will go up\", Howard told his party's annual conference in Brighton.\nThe opposition leader promised to hold down VAT to 5% and to \"protect the poorest from higher taxes\".\nHowever, if the Tories win an election, the Treasury will have to raise taxes or borrow more to maintain spending on public services, he said.\nHoward promised to pay for his policies by \"cutting unnecessary government spending\" and by reforming the public sector.\nBut the Conservatives are pledging an extra �3bn on benefits to bring more single parents into the workplace, although ministers have not said how this would affect taxes or spending on other parts of the public sector.\nThe policy has been attacked as \"bogus\" by Tony Blair, the prime minister.\nUnder a Conservative government, there would be a cut in income tax at the first band, bringing it down to 12% at the lowest level.\nThere would be a 5% tax rate for savings and a cut in capital gains tax.\n\"I know that these proposals will be attacked by those who wish to keep the Tories as a minority party,\" Howard said.\n\"They will say these policies will cost more than I am promising.\n\"I stand here and I tell you, that by cutting unnecessary government spending and reform of the public sector, we can pay for the good things we think should be done.\"\nHow did Tony Blair react to Howard's tax proposals?\nHow did Conservative tax proposals benefit the wealthiest members of society?\nDo you think it is possible to reduce government spending while continuing to provide services?\nWhat would have happened if the Conservatives had won the 2005 elections?\nHow would Howard's tax proposals affect people at all levels of the income scale?

    "Crypto and fiat currencies, two financial systems that have existed in separate realms are becoming strangely intertwined. \n\nStarting with crypto, it's no secret that it has been on a bullish run in the past decade. With Bitcoin leading the way, the adoption of cryptocurrencies has seen an exponential rise. This can be attributed to their decentralized nature that promotes transparency, security, and freedom from traditional financial institutions. That said, the extreme volatility and relative infancy of the crypto market raises skepticism.\n\nIt's important to highlight that we're seeing increased institutional investment and government interest in crypto. Countries like El Salvador have made Bitcoin legal tender, while others like China are launching their own digital currencies. This arguably points towards a future where crypto plays a critical role in global economics.\n\nOn the other hand, we have fiat currencies, thousands of years old, tried and tested. Their value is backed and controlled by governments, offering a sense of stability. However, inflation is a nagging concern. Look at countries like Zimbabwe or Venezuela where hyperinflation has crashed the value of their fiat currencies to near nothing.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nI believe the future of finance is not a replacement of fiat by crypto, but an integration of both. I envision currencies operating on digital and blockchain technologies regulated by governments and international standards. It offers the advantages of crypto — transparency, security, speed, and cuts red tape.\n\nThe biggest hurdle is regulation. Effective regulation will increase confidence in crypto, opening avenues for its mainstream adoption. This will require a massive global cooperative effort, which sort of opposes the libertarian dream of absolute decentralization.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the future of money isn’t a 'crypto vs fiat' game but is about creating a new paradigm where they co-exist and perhaps, evolve together. Only time will tell whether this is a feasible reality or just a financial pipe dream.",
    "\"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping\" is a mock documentary that brilliantly parodies the world of pop music. It is a hilarious take on the sometimes ridiculous nature of the music industry, combined with an entertaining storyline that's impactful in its execution.\n\nThis film features Andy Samberg as pop sensation Connor4Real, a character who hogs the spotlight with his infectious energy, humor, and dramatic yet comedic antics. Samberg’s performance nails the charming, self-absorbed pop star persona with absolute perfection, delivering a healthy dose of laughter throughout the movie.\n\nThe faux documentary style allows the movie to showcase a series of hysterical scenes, embedded with witty one-liners and outrageous comedy. The narrative never misses an opportunity to satirize the superficial, ego-maniacal aspects of today's music icons, and their outlandish lifestyles. \n\nThe songs in \"Popstar\" are intentionally ridiculous, yet they are catchy and well-composed. Serving as hilarious parodies of real songs, they integrate seamlessly into the storyline and elevate the film’s humor. The lyrics are outrageous and absurd, yet they perfectly fit the ludicrousness of the hyperbolic pop world represented in the film.\n\nThe cameos from actual musicians and celebrities also deserve a mention. They contribute significantly to the authenticity of the satire, making the movie even more enjoyable. Each cameo, from artists like Mariah Carey, Snoop Dogg, and Seal adds to the overall humorous tone and helps generate further batch of laughs.\n\n\"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping\", produced by The Lonely Island and Judd Apatow, showcases the best of comedic storytelling. It's a roller coaster ride of humor, an amusing critique of various aspects of the pop music industry, delivered through over-the-top performances and hysterical lyrics. The storyline, combined with clever humor and great acting, results in a movie that is entertaining from start to finish, a must-watch for anyone who loves music, comedy, and laughing out loud.\n",

    "Tarzan: an adventure about a man on what was intended to be a permanent expedition to the rainforest of Nairobi. His wife returns from the East looking to keep him safe. With few words the two of them meet a savage man calling himself, the White King. The King demands their lives and offers only two gifts- a beautiful woman as his wife, and the right to claim the jungle as his own. The search for his wife and his jungle kingdom is a perilous one. With the help of other explorers and native clans Tarzan struggles against the King's forces, while trying to stay alive. To win the King's heart, Tarzan must teach his people the ways of life in this mysterious land and learn the secrets of his identity. With Tarzan in deep peril, an old friend brings home the secret to saving his life, a long ago tale of heroism from a legendary warrior. The film's music was written and composed by the rock band, Rush. It was also a big hit and remains in print to this day. The film is produced and directed by Jeff Fuller, with his wife, Cindy, acting as producer. He has directed other films, including \"The Man with the Golden Arm,\" starring Jim Carrey and the Oscar nominated \"The Descendants.\" The film will be released in theaters December 14th. The film also received a special featurette entitled \"The Making of the Film\" and appeared on the Criterion Collection. A second Criterion release of the film is planned but this time with the inclusion of a new 4k release. This time the soundtrack will also be available in 4K. Below is the theatrical trailer.",

    "This has gone wrong – as in, badly in a way you wouldn't expect – since its release on April 27th. The film has made nearly $5 million in just over two weeks after its launch. It earned just under $1 million during the weekend when it was out wide and less than that on Thursday or Friday. So why does this happen? Perhaps it's because audiences aren't paying attention to \"Kickboxers\". For now, only 20 percent have seen it to date, and there are even rumors that the company behind this film is planning to go back into production. Or maybe, like I mentioned earlier – something more subtle, a fault of marketing. As well-known action/martial arts flick Kickboxer opened to strong reviews at the start of the summer so perhaps producers didn't want to risk not having an opening, not wanting to get caught short with such an obvious hit based on a very popular name among moviegoers. If those two theories hold true, then we can look forward in May to \"Kickboxer's\" return. I've just witnessed what happens when things don't work in your favor (I'll leave you to figure out how, just trust me)…\n\nWhile a lot of people may be waiting eagerly behind their screens to see whether they're going to make a decent living watching a certain character kickbox against other wrestlers to some silly music while some terrible looking graphic novel comes off next to nothing, the real question remains unanswered: if a little-known superhero movies really are playing up the appeal of Kickpuncher, could it cause them any harm at all?

    "In their first league game against Nottingham Forest he seemed to have already picked up his head injury when he collapsed and was helped off in the second half, leaving the centre-half unable to continue into the start of Saturday's home match against Leicester City. But Kewell will be examined on Monday when the Blues can call upon him as a temporary replacement to Jose Bosingwa after Chris Brunt got injured during City's Capital One Cup third round win at Derby County in midweek. The 27 year old has endured the worst injury luck of any QPR player this season but with Jamie Mackie limping around much like Chris Dagnall did before a horrific knee injury, Kewell could easily fill that gap if needed. After all it has been just three years since Kewell played for Rangers for the last time against Birmingham City back in May 2008 when he made an immediate impact in the 2-2 draw. He would go on to establish himself at Brentford where he enjoyed great success as well earning 3 England caps. More recently some key performances such as these kept him firmly in the spotlight again this past season while he was also very much involved in bringing many other younger talent through QPR's academy both domestically as well abroad including Dutch starlet Adriaanse (currently on loan at Norwich City) who scored 15 Premier League goals for QPR earlier this season and 17 appearances for Belgium U19s which include 3 caps for their senior side. His arrival at Loftus Road gives us hope about the direction this team is heading when they look more solid than they probably ever have before under the excellent Tony Fernandes taking charge. On Friday we watched Luke Young and Charlie Austin play for a short period of the game. With only Joey Barton between them the youngsters were impressive despite scoring no points with Austin currently on strike but both are part of what may prove to be a really good unit going forward and with Jack Robinson coming out of the game after injuring his hamstring Tony Fernandes has plenty of options in front of goal going forward, starting with a potential debut as early as tomorrow evening at Fulham.\n\nAdvertisements",
    "\"Captain America: Civil War\" is an exemplary display of superheroes at their finest and at their worst. The Russo Brothers spare no expense pulling the strings, firing up an action-packed, emotionally resonate saga that will leave every Marvel fan enthralled. The film masterfully integrates a profound discourse on political responsibility and accountability into its steadfast, adrenaline-fueled narrative. \n\nThe acting is strikingly good. Chris Evans embodies Captain America with an earnest and tenacious energy, underscoring a believable tension between duty and friendship. Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man with a palpable sense of internal struggle, reminding fans of the depths of the characters beyond their superhuman powers. The ensemble cast fills in the gaps wonderfully, each character shining independently without overpowering the others. \n\nThe introduction of Spider-man (played by Tom Holland) feels seamless and has been handled with care, adding a light-hearted yet substantial element to the ensemble. Chadwick Boseman’s debut as the Black Panther gives us glimpses of what turns out to be an extraordinary character setting the way for his solo film. \n\nHowever, the film isn't just about the heroes but the rollercoaster ride that is their conflicting philosophies. For devoted followers of the MCU, the sight of the Avengers battling one another is heart-rending yet fascinating. It is an indicator that Marvel isn't coy about the grim repercussions of their intergalactic escapades.\n\nThe special effects are spectacular, impressing in fight sequences that are intense, palpable, and visually stunning, while the climactic airport sequence is a showstopper. The production design team does an exquisite job as we see the MCU get more interconnected with intricate set designs, costumes, and props. \n\nThe script successfully balances high-octane action, potent humor, and character development, a feat not easily achieved. The dialogue is slick and sassy, bestowing the film with a character of its own. Arguably, this is what sets \"Captain America: Civil War\" apart—despite the epic superhero battles and jaw-dropping VFX, it is essentially a character-driven film. \n\nIn conclusion, \"Captain America: Civil War\" is a thrilling cinematic experience that provides exhilarating action sequences, ample humor and a deep, emotional undertow. This film epitomizes the best of what the Marvel Cinematic Universe offers, a must-watch for any fan out there.",
    "Mexican football fans are keeping a close eye on Juninho, the Brazilian midfielder currently playing for Lyon, amid rumours of his growing dissatisfaction with the French club. \n\nJuninho, 34, has been a key player for Lyon since his arrival in 2001, helping the club to win seven consecutive Ligue 1 titles. However, recent reports suggest that the Brazilian is unhappy with his current situation at the club, sparking interest from several Mexican teams.\n\nSources close to the player have hinted at a possible move to the Mexican league, with clubs such as Club America and Tigres UANL reportedly showing interest. The Mexican league is known for attracting high-profile players from Europe and South America, and Juninho's potential arrival would undoubtedly be a significant coup.\n\nJuninho's dissatisfaction at Lyon reportedly stems from a lack of playing time. Despite his age, the Brazilian still possesses a lethal free-kick and is renowned for his vision and passing ability. His experience and leadership qualities would be a valuable addition to any team.\n\nThe Mexican league's transfer window opens in June, and it is expected that negotiations for Juninho's potential move could begin then. However, Lyon's management has not yet commented on the rumours, and it remains to be seen whether they would be willing to let go of one of their most influential players.\n\nJuninho's potential move to Mexico would be a significant boost for the league, which has been working hard to increase its international profile. The arrival of a player of Juninho's calibre would undoubtedly attract more attention to Mexican football and could pave the way for other high-profile players to consider a move to the league.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these are still just rumours, and until there is official confirmation from either Lyon or Juninho himself, Mexican fans will have to wait and see whether they will get the chance to see the Brazilian maestro in action on their home turf.",

    "This paper presents a novel method for fully automatic myocardial segmentation of contrast echocardiography sequences using random forests guided by a shape model. The proposed method combines the strengths of machine learning and statistical shape models to achieve accurate and robust segmentation. The random forest classifier is trained to recognize myocardial tissues based on intensity, texture, and temporal features, while the shape model guides the segmentation process to ensure anatomical plausibility. The method was evaluated on a dataset of 100 patients and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. This research contributes to the field of medical image analysis by providing a reliable tool for automatic myocardial segmentation, which is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",
    "\"The Cannonball Run\" is a classic 80's comedy that is a pure joyride from start to finish. The film is a madcap ensemble piece that features a star-studded cast including Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Farrah Fawcett, and even a surprise appearance by Jackie Chan. The plot is simple yet engaging, revolving around an illegal cross-country race where the only rule is to reach the finish line first.\n\nThe film's charm lies in its unpretentious approach to comedy. It doesn't try to be anything more than a fun, entertaining romp, and it succeeds brilliantly. The humor is slapstick and often absurd, but it's delivered with such gusto and enthusiasm that it's impossible not to be swept up in the fun. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, with Reynolds and DeLuise, in particular, sharing a delightful comedic rapport.\n\nThe action sequences are well-executed and exciting, with the car chases and stunts providing plenty of adrenaline-fueled thrills. The film also benefits from a breezy pace that ensures there's never a dull moment. The cinematography is vibrant and colorful, perfectly capturing the film's upbeat, energetic tone.\n\n\"The Cannonball Run\" may not be high art, but it's not trying to be. It's a light-hearted, feel-good movie that's designed to entertain, and it does so with aplomb. It's a testament to the film's enduring appeal that it remains a beloved cult classic decades after its initial release. If you're in the mood for a fun, fast-paced comedy with a fantastic cast and plenty of laughs, \"The Cannonball Run\" is well worth a watch.",

    ">Referring image segmentation (RefSeg) estimates the object that matches a given reference in an image. In existing methods, the reference is extracted by the convolutional feature map in a single network, which suffers from two problems as follows. First, a reference may correspond to an extremely small area or an entire image. Second, this method only can perceive the local patterns in the feature map and fails to explore a global perception of the reference and image pair. To this end, we propose a novel RefSeg framework, named CMF. CMF consists of three modules, namely a global module, a local module, and a mask prediction module. Specifically, given an image and a reference, the global module first extracts an attention-aware global representation based on a global matching strategy. Then, the local module extracts a local representation according to the visual relationship between the image and reference. To eliminate the semantic gap between the global and local representations, a cascaded multimodel fusion module (CMF module) with multi-attention and multiple-model is proposed to fuse these two representations. Finally, a mask prediction module is proposed to predict a semantic mask based on the global and local representations. In particular, the CMF module leverages the global perception to perform a better reference refinement task, and the local perception further enhances the discriminability of the global perception by introducing a local perception. The experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art RefSeg methods.\n\n\nIntroduction\nReferring image segmentation (RefSeG), which refers to detecting and masking the target by specifying a natural language description [1], has been paid increasing attention recently as a fundamental task in the computer vision field. It requires machines to extract the target mentioned by text and segment it into a semantic mask. Recently, a number of methods for this task have been proposed [2][3][4][5][6]. Among them, deep learning-based methods [3][4][5] have rapidly achieved considerable progress. However, there are still many challenges due to their nature. For example, the reference mentioned by the text may refer to an extremely small area or a large area that occupies the whole image, making the task more challenging. Another issue is that it is hard to fully identify a target because the visual appearance of objects is",
    "This paper introduces the Bilateral Awareness Network (BANet), a fusion of the Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for improved semantic segmentation of very high-resolution urban scene images. The BANet conceptually divides the segmentation problem into two parts - intra-region consistency and inter-region discriminability. It introduces Bilateral Attention Module and Position-Aware Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and spatial details, yielding superior results compared to prevalent methods. Experiments on remote sensing datasets prove the effectiveness of BANet in urban scene understanding. Nonetheless, the proposed model also offers wider applications in multiple image understanding tasks.\n",

    "\"In this paper, we present a new approach for facial landmark detection, based on deep learning, that combines multiple deep neural networks into a single super-trained system for facial landmark recognition. Our system can learn to extract landmarks from any object feature image, including ones that are not directly visible, or for example when a human's face is obscured by an object. We present extensive analyses showing that our algorithm can accurately predict facial landmark attributes in the absence of extensive landmark knowledge, and also demonstrate its ability to converge on a human-recognized human face. Our data set is enriched with a relatively large number of human faces that are well known to both computer vision researchers and general users, which makes our task interesting for both researchers and users.\n\nThe current state of facial recognition technologies is centered around automated analysis of images, mainly from online sources. While human recognition, also known as face detection, is an important research topic for the future, the current state of automated computer vision has focused on simple face detection, such as recognizing face, or face contours; detecting the distance between two objects; or recognizing a single shape features. The aim of this work is to find a more comprehensive approach or paradigm for facial detection, which will enable computer vision research to be carried out in a more advanced manner in the near future. Our proposed approach uses several deep learning models to represent the features of the human face, and combines these with the knowledge of each feature in order to model the user's facial expressions, thereby creating a novel facial detection framework. The proposed approach enables machine learning to deal with complex and diverse problems, ranging from tracking the facial movements of faces, to detecting facial distortions. Our results support the idea that deep learning has the potential to increase computational efficiency and make computer vision accessible to a large community of researchers.\n\nThe goal of this work is to demonstrate that deep learning achieves super-realtime facial landmark detection. With this approach, the neural networks can learn to discover landmarks on the basis of unsupervised feature learning, to achieve a state-of-the-art performance of 6.4% in a task where only 20% of the images were annotated with landmark boundaries. To demonstrate the validity of our work, we analyzed the accuracy and accuracy of our proposed approach against the state-of-the-art of existing",
    "The iconic French fashion house, Lacroix, has been acquired by a US-based firm, marking a significant shift in the ownership of one of the most prestigious labels in the fashion industry. The details of the deal, including the name of the US firm and the purchase price, have not been disclosed yet.\n\nFounded by Christian Lacroix in 1987, the Lacroix label has been synonymous with luxury and high fashion for over three decades. Known for its extravagant, colourful designs and intricate detailing, the brand has been a favourite among celebrities and fashion enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nThe acquisition comes at a time when the fashion industry is undergoing significant changes due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many brands are struggling with declining sales and are looking for innovative ways to stay afloat.\n\nThe US firm, which is yet to be named, is expected to bring a fresh perspective and new strategies to the Lacroix label. Industry insiders speculate that the new owners might focus on expanding the brand's digital presence and e-commerce capabilities, given the current trend of online shopping.\n\nThe Lacroix label has had a tumultuous history, with several changes in ownership and management. In 2005, it was bought by the Falic Group, a US duty-free retailer. However, the brand struggled financially and filed for bankruptcy in 2009. Since then, it has been focusing on licensing deals and has not produced a ready-to-wear collection.\n\nThe acquisition by the US firm could mark a new chapter for the Lacroix label. It remains to be seen how the brand will evolve under its new ownership and whether it will be able to regain its former glory in the competitive world of high fashion.\n\nChristian Lacroix, the founder of the label, has not been involved in the brand's operations since 2009. His flamboyant and extravagant designs were a stark contrast to the minimalist trend of the 90s, earning him a dedicated following.\n\nThe fashion industry will be watching closely to see how the Lacroix label will navigate its future under the new US ownership.

    "Current approaches based on convolutional networks perform well at image classification tasks but are often unable to pinpoint where within an input sample that these characteristics exist, even with weak supervision data provided by humans post hoc [1]. In this work we propose one approach using weakly supervised learning and two others which employ strong annotation such as region scribbling or point labeling via bounding boxes around important features inside images belonging our desired target class (e.g., tumors). These methods allow us not just identify presence/absence information about classes across domains like MRI scans vs ultrasound videos – what’s more they also predict locations! To do so effectively though you must take into account both context level coarseness(how big things get) when choosing thresholds during optimization algorithms; tuning parameters may be necessary too depending upon network structures used etc.\",\n\n  author='John Doe', 'Peter Smith Jr.', email=\"johndoe@examplecorpsemaildomainnameextensioncom\")",
    "Advocacy learning has demonstrated strong promise for many domains and we are rapidly becoming accustomed to applying this approach. However, few datasets have been studied experimentally with adversarial training such as the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task, which includes more than 500 million trials over almost two decades. Here, we propose an approach that allows generating ad-hoc networks through supervised, unconstrained sampling, enabling robust training even on data not suitable or appropriate for other methods. As in previous approaches (e.g., refs. 25⇓–27), our framework is based upon factorisation of the latent representations of discrete classes into more interpretable clusters by reducing their inter-class similarity; however, by adopting an extra layer between these hidden states, our generative model can represent high dimensional features efficiently without being trained in advance.\n\nThese ideas also appear in Nils Brauer's work, The Design (or Lack thereof) Of Learning From Imperfect Data; A Perspective On Support Vector Machines With Generalization Problems, but they're more developed here, with some really neat implementation examples at the end.

    "'Howl's Moving Castle' is the newest and possibly most wonderful thing one may see this year, with a story that has taken a long time to come to fruition, from the creation of the series of books by C.S. Lewis through the book trilogy about the castle, the film adaptation, and the books by Christopher Chabrol and Guy Gavriel Kay. The main goal for the writer/director is the simple one: to tell the story of an unforgettable adventure — a tale that has gripped the imaginations, and the hearts, for more than a century.\n\nThe story, in the simplest and most obvious sense, takes place in the world that Lewis created on his beloved planet of Narnia, with the help of some rather unlikely friends.\n\nHowl himself is no hero. Rather, he is haunted by a traumatic experience in his youth, which has caused him to seek out the only people he could trust; the residents of 'The Other Side,' the little village that lives within a crumbling, magically protected castle.\n\nThe residents of 'The Other Side' are the true heroes, as they act as a force for justice for Howl — and help him to cope with the fact that being his friend is almost as much a curse as it is a blessing.\n\nThe story is based on books that Lewis would have probably read in his younger days; and this movie presents Lewis's work in a new light, presenting his characters and the story itself in a slightly different light than it was presented in the books.\n\nThe film has a truly enchanting quality that is only available in the books — especially for the young adult crowd. But, it is not just for young readers that the film captures the magic; it is an experience that will touch any audience, no matter the age limit of the audience.\n\nIf you are a fan of Lewis's work, and want to experience it in a new way, and watch this masterpiece of a film, then 'Howl's Moving Castle' is the one for you.\n\nThe story\n\nThe story for howl's moving castle is about a magical world, and the very human journey that some people make in order to get there.

But the outcome of elections - many analysts say the most competitive in decades - will also be closely watched for the degree to which it will change a leadership which has been in place for a decade despite continuing political turmoil.\n\n[Comment at Unz.com]",

    "This film is about a young woman who has been raped by her father and then left to die in an abandoned house. She is rescued by a group of women, including a nun, who take her in and raise her as their own daughter. The story follows the life of this girl through her adolescence and into adulthood. It's a very moving film that will make you feel sorry for the poor girl.\n\nI have seen this movie twice now and I can say with confidence that it is one of the best films I've ever seen. This is not just because of its beautiful cinematography or its powerful performances but also because of how well it tells a story. There are many scenes where the camera focuses on the character's face and body language and we see them reacting to what they're going through. We get to know these characters and understand why they do what they do.\n\nThere are some scenes that are so intense that I had to pause the movie several times to catch my breath. These scenes were so powerful that I felt like I was watching something out of a horror movie. They made me want to cry and scream at the same time.\n\nOne scene in particular really stuck with me. When the mother of the girl is talking to her daughter she says, \"You don't need to be afraid anymore.\" And then she turns around and looks directly at the camera. That moment really moved me. I couldn't help but think about all the other girls who have gone through similar situations and how scared they must have been when they first saw their rapists.\n\nIt's hard to describe exactly what makes this movie so special. But I'll try. First off, there is no music in this movie. No music means that the movie doesn't rely on any kind of catchy tunes to keep us entertained. Instead, the movie uses silence to tell a story. Second, the acting is amazing. Every single actor does a great job portraying their roles. Third, the cinematography is stunning. Each shot is beautifully composed and every frame is filled with emotion. Fourth, the soundtrack is incredible. The song used during the opening credits is called \"Ain't Nobody Home\". It's a haunting tune that perfectly captures the mood of the movie. Fifth, the ending is heartbreaking. It shows the true meaning of love and loss.\n\nOverall, Mama is a wonderful movie that will leave you feeling sad,",
    "\"U-571\" is a thrilling, action-packed World War II drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The film is set in the heart of the Atlantic Ocean, where a group of American submariners are tasked with a daring mission to capture a German Enigma machine. \n\nThe film's strength lies in its ability to create a palpable sense of tension and claustrophobia, effectively capturing the fear and uncertainty that comes with submarine warfare. The underwater sequences are particularly well-executed, with the director using a combination of tight shots and atmospheric lighting to create a sense of impending doom. \n\nThe ensemble cast, led by Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, and Harvey Keitel, deliver strong performances. McConaughey, in particular, shines as the young and inexperienced Lieutenant who is thrust into a leadership role under the most challenging circumstances. His transformation from a hesitant officer to a decisive leader forms the emotional core of the film.\n\nHowever, \"U-571\" is not without its flaws. The plot, while engaging, is riddled with historical inaccuracies that may irk some viewers. The film takes significant liberties with the facts, most notably the fact that it was actually the British, not the Americans, who captured the first Enigma machine. \n\nDespite these inaccuracies, \"U-571\" succeeds in delivering a suspenseful and engaging war film. The intense action sequences, solid performances, and high-stakes drama make it a must-watch for fans of the genre. While it may not be a historically accurate representation of events, it is a gripping and entertaining cinematic experience.",
    "\"Aerial image semantic segmentation has recently witnessed substantial breakthroughs using deep models. However, these large-scale aerial images often have thousands of classes or objects and it's unclear whether existing segmentation algorithms are suitable for such tasks. Unlike the common practice of leveraging point cloud annotations for object detection/segmentation, we propose to use a point-based feature representation and propose a novel method named PointFlow, which is applicable to a wide range of modern computer vision algorithms. The PointFlow is trained on two phases (a flow prediction phase and a segmentation task). The first phase takes advantage of the sparse 3D point cloud annotations to learn the coarse flows from a sparse 3D point cloud. The flows are then learned through point-wise supervision in the second phase in a self-supervised manner. PointFlow is a generalizable feature which can be easily used in popular 2D CNNs. Extensive experiments on the aerial images with thousands of categories show that PointFlow outperforms its point-based competitors by a large margin. Code and models are available at this https URL.\"\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"PointGroup: Segmenting Multi-Instance Scenes with Transformers\" from arxiv.org:\n\"We propose a transformer-based scene segmentation model to address the problem of segmenting multi-instance scenes in autonomous driving. The proposed method is trained end-to-end using a self-supervised learning method that leverages image-level and scene-level semantic segmentation as two auxiliary tasks. As an explicit representation of spatial relationships, the self-attention mechanism in transformers shows potential to learn geometric representations. To this end, we propose PointGroup, which consists of three modules, the self-attention aggregation module, the self-attention aggregation aggregation module and the mask attention module. The two self-attention modules can be treated as a transformer encoder; the mask attention module integrates the information of point features, which is the key to the model's generalization ability. In addition, we use a point-based sparse feature representation, in which each point represents a unique class, resulting in a better feature expression ability and an improved data balance in semantic segmentation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics in the multi-instance segmentation (MIS) task. We",
    "I've been having this problem with my '67 Falcon recently. It has always been running smoothly, but lately, it doesn't want to start or run at all sometimes. I've narrowed down the problem to what seems like a fuel delivery issue - not getting gas to the carburetor. \n\nI've checked a few things off the list. The gas tank is full and I also replaced the fuel filter thinking it might have been clogged up, but unfortunately, it didn't resolve the problem. When I detach the fuel line from the carburetor and crank the engine, gas does come out, though the flow is inconsistent and seems weak. The car will run if I manually feed it gas, which confirms it's indeed a fuel delivery issue.\n\nAs I'm just a hobbyist and not a mechanic, I'm at a bit of a loss for what to check next. \n\nHave anyone experienced this before? Do you think the issues with the fuel pump? Carburetor Float is stuck maybe? I'd appreciate any advice on what to inspect or replace next. Thanks so much in advance.",
    "Foster parents across the UK are set to receive a minimum rate of payment, following a new government initiative aimed at improving the lives of children in care. The move is designed to ensure that foster parents are adequately compensated for the vital role they play in providing a stable and nurturing environment for vulnerable children.\n\nThe Department for Education has announced that the new minimum rate will be introduced from April next year. The exact amount will vary depending on the age of the child and the region in which the foster parents live. However, it is expected to be a significant increase on the current average payment, which is widely considered to be insufficient.\n\nThe decision comes after a lengthy consultation process involving foster parents, children's charities, and local authorities. Many foster parents have long argued that the financial support they receive does not adequately reflect the cost of raising a child, particularly those with complex needs.\n\nThe Children's Minister, who announced the new policy, said: \"Foster parents do an incredible job in providing love, support and a stable home for children who desperately need it. They should not have to worry about whether they can afford to provide for these children. This new minimum rate recognises the invaluable work they do and ensures they receive the financial support they need.\"\n\nThe move has been welcomed by children's charities and foster care organisations. The Fostering Network, the UK's leading fostering charity, described the announcement as a \"game-changer\". Its chief executive, Kevin Williams, said: \"This is a significant step forward. For too long, many foster parents have struggled financially. This new minimum rate will help ensure that fostering is a viable option for more people, which will ultimately benefit the children in care.\"\n\nHowever, some critics argue that while the increase in financial support is welcome, more needs to be done to address the wider issues facing the foster care system. These include a shortage of foster parents, particularly for teenagers and sibling groups, and the need for better support and training for those taking on the role.\n\nThe new minimum rate for foster parents is part of a broader package of measures aimed at improving the foster care system. These include increased funding for training and support, and a new national recruitment campaign to attract more people to become foster parents.\n\nThe government hopes that by improving the financial support for foster parents, more people will be encouraged to take on the role, leading to better outcomes for children in care.",
    "This paper presents the implementation of the adversarial constraint-based CNN with a large vocabulary. In contrast with previous efforts we employ fully connected components, which allows us to achieve better performance under unsupervised, multi-label classification tasks. All of our classes are implemented in the fully connected layer based on the adversarial constraint-based training framework proposed in [Sharma19][Keen21]. However, unlike traditional adversarial training, the CNN is trained directly and never participates in the learning process. We demonstrate significant improvement in classification accuracy in the unsupervised task in two different images of the same patient based only on the original CNN structure and using a large natural vocabulary. Using the adversarial structure, each CNN class is trained with different weights, and the resulting loss of each type of CNN is computed. Our approach achieves robustness and speed in comparison with the traditional approach.\n\nThis is definitely a big first step in the AI space here, and while they say this will be implemented in a medical imaging application, you could easily run the same approach on any subject, especially in the domain of medical imaging, which needs some type of classification to distinguish between healthy and sick people. From where we are standing, we can't tell you exactly how that will play out in the real world, but we're not exactly betting against it having some serious, positive effects.\n\n[image credit: iStock]",

    "David Blunkett has apologised for his role in planning to kill former Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw, it emerged today. The former home secretary was killed by an IRA bomb in London in March 1997 and Mr Blunkett was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. He served two years in prison before being released on licence. In a statement issued through his solicitors, Mr Blunkett said he had been \"deeply ashamed\" at what he did. He added that he would never again be involved in such activities.\n\nIn other words, David Blunkett's apology is not about the fact that he was convicted of conspiring with terrorists to murder someone. It is about how he feels about himself.\n\nThis is the same man who once told the BBC that he felt like a \"piggy bank\".\n\nHe also claimed that he could have stopped the IRA bombing of Downing Street if he'd just gone to see Tony Blair.\n\nAnd now he says he regrets everything he ever did.\n\nI'm sure this will come as no surprise to anyone who knows anything about him.",

    "There is a lot of action in this film and if it is not an action sequence, there will be one just down the road. Some parts are very realistic and others are more of a comical, tongue-in-cheek humor. Keanu Reeves does a fantastic job in this sequel with John Wick. He is a very strong character and you feel the pain he experiences and the heartache that comes along. He really gets into the character and it shows. I would say this is one of the rare times that a sequel beats the original. The fact that they were able to get this many stars and keep them interested in the story to work is an accomplishment. I would definitely recommend seeing this film, as it will probably be the best way to introduce John Wick to a new generation of fans.\nI watched the film about twenty times and it was as good as the first. It was a good story of how the people of America are trying to live with the new laws. This movie is an action packed movie that is one to see. I will keep this in my DVD collection.\nI am not a big fan of the original John Wick. This film is the second one of the Wick franchise and it is a very satisfying film. The film is a good action film and it is also a good film to watch with your family. It has a good story, a great cast, good fight scenes, good dialogue, good special effects and good characters. It is a great film to watch with your family.\nI liked this movie and I think people should watch it. If you are not a fan of the movie, then watch it with your family.

    "Edinburgh Rugby will look at ways of making life even tougher for the visitors after a sluggish start to their European Champions Cup encounter with Pro 11 outfit Edinburgh Warriors on Sunday showed how difficult it would be to contain a powerful Argentinian backline and their backs in general.\n\nBoth teams were made to pay early, and this was only topped by Scotland's try to debutant Scott Lawson two minutes into added time, meaning that Argentina came up just short again when Joe Marler felled Sergio Parisse just before half-time. But as if that had not been bad enough, the Argentine scrum left too much ground for Scotland to cover going into the restart and prop Ben Toolis found space inside his 22 to race over with Ireland leading 31-18. The Scots responded straightaway but failed to close ranks against a relentless Argentine charge. They finished with 16.\n\nMeanwhile, former Argentina coach Henry O'Brien has warned his players about what awaits them next weekend and said they need to prepare more intelligently around the ball while also being mindful about the physical side of rugby against such formidable opponents.\n\nEngland fly-half Owen Farrell looked every bit on course for an Australian Test recall until falling awkwardly during the first half against Argentina in Toulon on Saturday before he was replaced.

    "US technology firm Yahoo celebrates another 10 years on the web and one-third fewer users as it announces a big shift in its business strategy. The change comes as chief executive Marissa Mayer prepares to try to turn around the struggling firm, which has been a casualty of the smartphone boom and its struggles to compete with Google Inc's (Nasdaq: GOOGL). […] The move means many users will miss out on information about future features since this is part of a much larger reorganisation, not all of which will be made clear until next summer. But the new approach - under the name News Group at Work, coming up shortly after the launch of Yahoo Maps - has been welcomed by analysts, who see greater agility than was seen previously for the company that once pioneered internet search, email and social networking while selling news, sports and entertainment for billions. […] Many have been puzzled why the tech giant had missed out on Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB) purchase last year of an American media unit of Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba – something many said might be linked to Yahoo's search dominance, which was blamed by investors for its slide to $44 per share in April 2011 (when Mr Mayer took over as CEO). One possible solution may lie in how News Group operates itself – possibly merging social properties such as Tumblr with traditional newspaper sites like the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Sports Illustrated, analysts were told.\n\nAs you can see, this article is mostly about what Yahoo does differently from how it did before Mr. Mayer stepped into the management position. Of course, when Mr. Mayer came aboard this situation was pretty chaotic; although Ms. Mayer says she was willing to change things around internally, few people were really happy to hear those changes due to various factors: namely not enough staff working remotely to support them (a problem Ms. Mayer is trying to correct); also, Yahoo is basically abandoning the internet content it was born out to excel in and instead opting to only offer \"news\" — just a bunch of very expensive clickbait blogs. Those who love Facebook (and frankly who cares…they are just ads!) would prefer to use Twitter or other social networks anyway but they don't give a shit if some articles, memes and videos get created within their platform. However, I am more inclined to believe that this article from 2009 talks way too much about the original plan because that didn't",
    "The future of mobile technology is set to be dominated by aesthetics and music, according to industry experts. As smartphones become increasingly ubiquitous, manufacturers are focusing on design and audio capabilities to differentiate their products in a crowded market.\n\nThe shift towards prioritising looks and music is a response to changing consumer demands. With the basic functionality of smartphones now largely standardised, users are looking for devices that offer a more personalised experience. This includes a sleek design that reflects their personal style, as well as superior audio quality for listening to music and podcasts.\n\n\"Smartphones are no longer just communication devices. They are fashion accessories, entertainment hubs, and personal statement pieces,\" says tech analyst, Laura Hughes. \"Manufacturers who understand this and design their products accordingly are likely to have the edge in the coming years.\"\n\nOne company leading the way in this trend is Apple, with its iPhone range. The tech giant has always placed a strong emphasis on the aesthetic appeal of its products, and the iPhone is no exception. From the sleek lines of the device itself to the minimalist design of the user interface, every aspect of the iPhone is designed to be visually pleasing.\n\nIn terms of music, Apple's integration of its music streaming service, Apple Music, into its devices has been a game-changer. The service offers high-quality audio and a vast library of songs, making it a popular choice for music lovers.\n\nOther manufacturers are following suit. Samsung, for example, has partnered with Spotify to offer seamless music streaming on its devices. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturer Huawei has focused on developing its own high-quality audio hardware.\n\nThe trend towards prioritising looks and music is also reflected in the accessories market. High-end headphones and portable speakers are becoming increasingly popular, as consumers look to enhance their mobile music experience.\n\nHowever, some experts warn that focusing too much on aesthetics and music could lead to other important features being overlooked. \"Battery life, durability, and security are still key concerns for many consumers,\" says tech journalist, Mark Thompson. \"Manufacturers need to ensure they are not sacrificing these essentials in the pursuit of style and sound.\"\n\nAs the mobile market continues to evolve, it's clear that looks and music will play a pivotal role in shaping the smartphones of the future. But whether this focus on aesthetics and audio will ultimately prove to be a winning strategy remains to be seen.",

    "Abstract: We study the behaviour of a quantum particle interacting with a quantum environment. We start the problem in the mixed state, that is, we assume that  the initial state of the quantum particle is a density matrix. We assume that the quantum environment  consists of a set of quantum harmonic oscillators in a  particular state.  In our analysis we use the density matrix as the main\n  ingredient. The first part of the article is devoted to the theoretical derivation of formulas describing the evolution of the density matrix of the particle. The results are general and have been derived without any\n  approximation. Using the analytic formulas, we carry out\nnumerical calculations of the evolution of the density matrix for a\nparticular case - a harmonic oscillator coupling to a\nquantum electromagnetic field, the initial configuration of which is a\nthermal one.   The case of a particle scattering on random\npotential is briefly discussed\n\n\n\nIn the paper, the density matrix $\\rho_\\psi$ and its partial transposed\ndensity matrix $\\rho_\\psi^{PT}$ (P stands for partial transpose) are\ndefined as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho_\\psi= \\operatorname{Tr}_E \\ket \\psi \\bra \\psi\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{PTDME}\n\\rho_{\\psi}^{PT} = U^{PT}\n\\rho_{\\psi}U^{\\dagger PT},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere\n\\begin{equation} U^{PT} = \\Omega K\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Omega = \\sum^{2^{N-1} -1}_{k=0} (-1)^k \\ket k\\bra k,\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nK= \\sum^{2^N}_n n \\ket n \\bra n\n\\end{equation}\nThen\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho^{PT}_j = n \\ket n_j \\bra n_j + (N-2^N) \\mathbbm I\n\\end{equation}\nWith respect to equations of the paper we get\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho= \\rho_\\psi \\otimes \\",
    "This academic paper focuses on the development and evaluation of Fully Transformer Networks (FTN) for semantic image segmentation. Our approach effectively utilizes transformer models, traditionally employed in natural language processing, for pixel-level image recognition tasks. Unlike the standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the FTN leverages the global self-attention mechanisms of the transformer model to capture more complex dependencies between pixels. The research presents significant empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the FTN, especially in architectural and scene parsing benchmarks. The performance was evidenced to surpass existing CNN-based semantic segmentation approaches. This paper elucidates on the design, implementation, and optimization processes of the FTN, potentially heralding a new era in semantic image segmentation studies.",
    "This morning I was starting my day by turning on my computer at around 6am. Within an hour it was all black outside, with only a little bit of light coming through. The brightness came back on after 30 seconds. The brightness returned on, but is now more purple than the day before. Any time I use a desktop computer for more than a few minutes, I have to restart it. As many other redditors have reported, this has been happening to a lot of us. I am a college student, so I'm not sure if this is an isolated issue, or if it is a wider issue. This morning I saw another post about a similar situation and was thinking this might be a problem with this type of computer, but as I was going about 30 minutes in, it began to happen to me. The problem has been resolved, for the moment.\n\nA similar thread was posted on XDA-Developers' forums and quickly got more than 1,700 replies in the first 12 hours. There were a lot of suggestions about what to try to help, from adjusting the brightness control and the sleep/work mode on the mouse to using another computer, the only problem being that they were not sure if it would be related to the problem at all.\n\nSeveral users reported that their screens had returned to normal later on, and some even reported that they were able to use their computer without any issues. Some users took to the comments section on Reddit to express their concerns about this bug. Most people said that they had no idea what to do to solve the problem and that there were hardly any solutions that could help them in the short term.\n\nUpdate 1: The screen color problem has now been resolved, a Reddit user says:\n\nNo problem, it has, as of 7am today! The solution: I switched the brightness up by 50%, and it has reverted back to normal by 7:25am.\n\nUnfortunately no new solutions have been devised to get rid of the issue completely.",

    "1,432 user reviews\nPosted by Chris MacDonald at 8:51 PM\nI've recently decided that I'd like to see more movies in theaters. Part of this is for the sake of saving money, but I also just think it's better to not watch every movie online. In fact, I've decided that I'll only pay to see a movie in a theater if I have a sense that it's worthy of the expense. Otherwise, I'll wait and watch it on Blu-Ray.\nOne movie I saw in a theater a while back was \"Avengers: Infinity War\". I didn't bother to write a review of the movie, so I'll just say that I thought it was pretty good. Some parts of it worked better than others, but all told, I liked it. I especially liked the last part of the movie, with Thanos capturing the Soul Stone and destroying half of the universe. It took a bit of time getting to the point of Thanos taking the Stone, but that's not a big deal. I'd definitely recommend this movie.\nOne movie that I'm hoping to see soon, is the new \"Deadpool 2\". I wasn't impressed with the first one, but that was because of my expectation that the movie's central character would act more like a superhero in accordance with the comic book character I was familiar with from the 1990's. What I have learned is that Deadpool in the movies is nothing like the original comic book character. Instead, he is a much more raunchy character with a much grittier story. I think I'm okay with that. Maybe I'll have to watch the first \"Deadpool\" movie again, so I can take a second look at whether the change in character make sense. One thing that I have always liked about Deadpool was that he was in such bad shape, that if he had to punch a villain, it would probably turn his hands to pulp. It makes sense that people that are in poor physical condition wouldn't want to go around fighting.\nFor now, I just plan on seeing \"Deadpool 2\" and seeing what I can say about that.\nPosted by Chris MacDonald at 2:29 PM\nWith that, I'm going to close out for now. Have a great day and don't forget to remember that you are loved!\nPosted by Chris MacDonald at 10",
    "This paper presents an in-depth examination of the functional brain networks during the onset of anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness. We used advanced neuroimaging techniques to map out changes in the topological properties of brain networks as anaesthesia takes hold. Our findings emphasize the dynamic alterations in the structure and functioning of the brain's lobes under anesthesial influence. Particularly, we chronicled significant changes in the frontal and parietal lobes, the regions generally associated with consciousness and cognitive processes. The paper also suggests that different types of anesthetics have differing impacts on the brain's functional connectivity. This study contributes significantly to our understanding of the anesthetic effect on consciousness and offers insights beneficial for improving anesthetic techniques and neuro-cognitive therapeutic interventions.",

    "This paper presents a novel hybrid system that combines millimeter wave (mmWave) radar and camera technology for long-range depth imaging. The proposed system leverages the strengths of both technologies: the ability of mmWave radar to penetrate adverse weather conditions and provide distance information, and the high-resolution imaging capabilities of cameras. The paper discusses the design and implementation of the hybrid system, including the integration of the two technologies and the development of algorithms for data fusion and depth estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in providing accurate depth imaging over long distances, under various environmental conditions. This research opens up new possibilities for applications in areas such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and remote sensing.",
    "I've been playing Rainbow Six Siege religiously since its early days and I have loved the game for its uniqueness, tactical gameplay and the variety of operators to choose from. However, in the past two years, it seems to me like Ubisoft has been releasing operators who are either mediocre or completely useless.\n\nConsider operators like Amaru, Nokk, Warden, and Oryx. Amaru's ability is fun but also highly situational and often gets you killed more than helping you win a round. Nokk, who was expected to be the attacker's equivalent of Vigil, ended up being laughably weak with a subpar ability and weak loadout. Warden, despite having the potential of countering pesky smoke plants and blitz pushes, is a highly situational operator who largely depends on poor decision making of opponents to be effective. And don't even get me started on Oryx, who literally smashes through walls to surprise attackers, but ends up losing a significant portion of health in the process.\n\nThis isn't even an exhaustive list. There're other operators like Clash and Goyo who, instead of playing a significant role, just ends up messing the game balance. Even reworked operators like Tachanka and Glaz are unimpactful, considering their abilities still remain highly situational and hard to utilize effectively in most matches.\n\nWhat happened to the good old days where each operator had a unique and valuable skill set that contributed to the team's strategy like Thermite's exothermic charges or Smoke's toxic gas canisters? These operators had abilities that could change the course of a game if used correctly.\n\nI am not saying that every new op should be as valuable as Thermite or Smoke. Variety is a great thing. But what Siege really needs right now is consistency in delivering operators who bring new and interesting dynamics to the game while still being useful to the team. I'd rather have few but more impactful ops than many but mediocre ones.\n\nSiege is a great game, and it's sad to see so many disappointments in terms of new operators. I hope Ubisoft will review their operators development and design process and make necessary changes.\n\nI'd love to hear what you guys think about this. Maybe I'm being overly critical? Or are you too disappointed with the recent operator releases? Let's discuss.",
    "Scott Walker has been given a strong start to his campaign for president, with a new poll showing him leading Donald Trump by 12 points among likely Republican voters. The survey, conducted by Rasmussen Reports on behalf of ABC News and the Washington Post, shows that 42 per cent of Republicans would vote for Mr Walker if they could choose between them, compared to just 28 per cent who said they would support Mr Trump. In addition, Mr Walker leads Mrs Clinton by 10 points when third-party candidates are included.\n\nThis is not surprising at all. It's not like he was going to be able to win the nomination anyway. He had no chance whatsoever. But it does show how much the media have lost their minds over this election cycle. They're so desperate to find something negative about Trump that they've decided to make up anything they can.",
    "Former England Under-21 boss Stuart Pearce has expressed strong interest in succeeding Kevin Keegan as the permanent manager of Newcastle United. Keegan stepped down from the coveted position earlier this month due to disagreements with the club's hierarchy over player signings. Pearce, who guided the England Under-21 team to the final of the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, said he is ready for a new challenge in his career.\n\nPearce spent two years as manager of Manchester City before being sacked in 2007. Since then, he has gained significant experience working with young players as the head coach of England Under-21s. During that time, he successfully led the team to the Under-21 European Championships final in 2009 and semi-finals in 2007.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Pearce said, \"I've always maintained that my future lies in club management and the vacancy at Newcastle United represents a fantastic opportunity. It's a club with great tradition, passionate fans and a talented squad of players.\"\n\nHe expressed his admiration for Keegan, saying, \"Kevin did an incredible job whilst in charge of Newcastle, however the game moves on and now the focus is to build on his legacy.\" \n\nReacting to the news, former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer said, \"Stuart is a determined, ambitious coach with a strong mentality. I believe he could be the right leader for Newcastle at this critical time.\"\n\nPearce's interest in the role comes as Newcastle United has already began the search for a new manager, a process they admit might not be swift. Names such as former Lyon boss Bruno Genesio and ex-Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger have also been mooted as potential candidates for the role.\n\nNewcastle United are currently 14th in the Premier League, having won only one of their first four games of the season. Pearce, if appointed, would be tasked with improving the team's performances and hauling them up the table.\n\nEarlier this year, Pearce expressed his desire to go back into full-time management after enjoying his time in coaching duties with the England national team.\n\nNo official comment from Newcastle United regarding Pearce's statement has been made public yet.",
    "This paper proposes a novel approach to understand the single-impurity Anderson model — a key model in quantum physics that describes the behavior of magnetic impurities in non-magnetic metals. By introducing alternative equations of motion, this paper presents new perspectives on the model, enabling better insight into the dynamic interaction between magnetic impurities and conduction electrons. Detailed process and theoretical frameworks of this approach are elaborately discussed along with its potential advantages. Preliminary results illustrate that the proposed methodology not only provides more practical details and clearer physical pictures but also opens up possibilities for further studies in related fields. This paper suggests that alternative equation of motion analysis holds significant potential for exploring more complex quantum systems in future research.",
    "\"Born on the Fourth of July\" is a powerful portrayal of the horrors of the Vietnam War and its devastating repercussions on the American soldiers who fought in it. Directed with utmost precision by Oliver Stone, who himself served in Vietnam, this movie takes us through the tragic story of Ron Kovic, a Paralyzed Vietnam war veteran.\n\nTom Cruise is a revelation in his role as Ron Kovic. His seamless transformation from a naive, patriotic teenager to a disillusioned, embittered wheelchair-bound man is nothing short of incredible. This is one role where Cruise truly reveals the depth of his acting prowess.\n\nUnderneath Stone's direction, the film meticulously develops its perspective on the war, providing an unrestricted examination of the toll it takes on its soldiers physically and psychologically, earning its stripes as a remarkably raw and realistic depiction of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally good, especially Kyra Sedgwick, Raymo Gorrara, and Raymond J. Barry as they bring authenticity to their roles. Each actor crafts their performance in a way that adds weight to the narrative.\n\nThe cinematography and the editing are noteworthy, creating a charged atmosphere during the pivotal scenes, whereas John Williams's score hits all the right notes, evoking a myriad of emotions.\n\nDespite its harsh confrontational nature, \"Born on the Fourth of July\" is an important watch. It's a testament to the damaging effects of warfare and its aftermath. This Academy-Award winning film is filled with powerful, unforgettable dialogue as it takes the audience on a gut-wrenching journey. It’s a movie that demands reflection on the grim realities of war and what society owes to those who represent us on the battlefield.\n\nOne must laud the intensive nature of the film's storytelling, as it doesn't skip on the darker aspects of the story nor does it shelter its audience from the brutalities of war. Truth, in its barest form, encompasses every frame of this intense and engrossing narrative. \n\nWhile the film might be hard to stomach due to its raw depiction of trauma and combat, it is, without a doubt, an essential piece of cinema that is sure to leave a lasting impact. Ultimately, \"Born on the Fourth of July\" serves as an introspective commentary on the cost of war.",
    "\"The Great Dictator\" is a cinematic masterpiece that brilliantly combines comedy and drama to deliver a powerful commentary on the political climate of its time. Charlie Chaplin's performance is nothing short of extraordinary, as he seamlessly transitions between the roles of a Jewish barber and a ruthless dictator, showcasing his unparalleled versatility as an actor.\n\nThe film's narrative is a bold satire on fascism, with Chaplin's dictator character, Hynkel, being a clear caricature of Adolf Hitler. Despite the heavy subject matter, Chaplin manages to infuse the film with his signature comedic style, creating a unique blend of humor and seriousness that keeps the audience engaged throughout.\n\nThe film's most memorable scene is undoubtedly Chaplin's final speech, where he breaks character and directly addresses the audience. This impassioned plea for peace and unity is a testament to Chaplin's storytelling prowess and remains one of the most powerful moments in cinematic history.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Paulette Goddard and Jack Oakie, deliver commendable performances, adding depth to the film's narrative. The cinematography is top-notch, with each frame meticulously crafted to enhance the storytelling.\n\n\"The Great Dictator\" is a testament to Chaplin's genius as a filmmaker. It is a film that is as relevant today as it was when it was first released, reminding us of the power of cinema to challenge societal norms and inspire change. Despite being over 80 years old, the film's message continues to resonate, making \"The Great Dictator\" a timeless classic that deserves to be seen by every generation.",

    "The Labour Party has announced a new initiative aimed at tackling the issue of 'hardcore truants' - students who persistently miss school without a valid reason. The party believes that this issue is a significant factor in the underachievement of some students and is committed to addressing it.\n\nShadow Education Secretary, Kate Green, stated that the party's new policy would focus on providing support to families and schools to help ensure children attend school regularly. She also highlighted the importance of addressing the underlying issues that often lead to truancy, such as poverty, mental health problems, and family difficulties.\n\n\"Persistent absence from school can have a devastating impact on a child's education and future prospects,\" Green said. \"We need to do more to support families and schools to tackle this issue. This isn't about punishing parents, but about providing the help and support they need to get their children to school.\"\n\nThe Labour Party's initiative comes in response to recent statistics from the Department for Education, which revealed that around 300,000 students in England missed at least half a day of school each week in the 2018-2019 academic year. The figures also showed that children eligible for free school meals were more than twice as likely to be persistent absentees.\n\nUnder the new policy, Labour proposes to invest in early intervention services and provide more resources for schools to work with families and local agencies. The party also plans to review the current system of fines for parents whose children miss school without a valid reason, arguing that it often penalises those who are already struggling financially.\n\nThe initiative has been welcomed by several education charities and organisations. However, some critics argue that the focus should be on making school more engaging for students, rather than penalising parents.\n\nThe Conservative Party has responded to Labour's proposal by stating that they have already invested millions in programmes to reduce persistent absence and support disadvantaged students. They also defended the current system of fines, arguing that it is a necessary deterrent for parents who do not ensure their children's regular attendance at school.\n\nLabour's new policy on truancy is expected to be a key part of their education manifesto in the run-up to the next general election.",

    "French striker Nicolas Anelka is reportedly considering a move away from Manchester City, according to sources close to the player. The 26-year-old, who joined the club in 2002, is said to be unhappy with the team's performance and is looking for a new challenge.\n\nAnelka, who has scored 45 goals in 103 appearances for the club, has been linked with a move to several top European clubs, including Real Madrid and Barcelona. However, no official offers have been made as yet.\n\nThe French international has had a turbulent career, with spells at Arsenal, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool before his move to Manchester City. Despite his talent, he has often been criticised for his attitude and lack of commitment to the team.\n\nManchester City manager Stuart Pearce has refused to comment on the speculation surrounding Anelka's future at the club. However, he did say that he is focused on improving the team's performance and is not concerned about individual players.\n\n\"We are a team and we win and lose together. I am not interested in discussing individual players. My focus is on the team and how we can improve,\" Pearce said.\n\nAnelka's potential departure could be a significant blow for Manchester City, who are currently struggling in the Premier League. The striker has been one of the team's most consistent performers and his goals have often been crucial in securing points for the club.\n\nHowever, some fans believe that a move could be beneficial for both parties. They argue that Anelka's departure could free up funds for new signings, while the player himself could benefit from a fresh start at a new club.\n\nAnelka's agent, Doug Pingisi, has refused to comment on the speculation, stating that his client is currently focused on his duties at Manchester City. However, he did not rule out a potential move in the future.\n\n\"Nicolas is a professional and he is committed to Manchester City. However, like any player, he wants to win trophies and play at the highest level.

    "\"JFK\" is a masterful piece of cinema that delves into one of the most controversial events in American history - the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Directed by Oliver Stone, this film is a riveting exploration of conspiracy theories surrounding the event, presented in a way that is both engaging and thought-provoking.\n\nThe film's narrative is complex and layered, yet Stone manages to weave the intricate details into a compelling storyline that keeps the audience hooked from start to finish. The use of different film stocks to differentiate between the present, flashbacks, and historical footage is a brilliant touch, adding to the overall authenticity and immersive nature of the film.\n\nKevin Costner delivers a powerful performance as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans district attorney who suspects that there's more to JFK's assassination than the official story. His portrayal of a man driven by the pursuit of truth, despite the personal and professional costs, is both convincing and moving. The supporting cast, including Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, and Sissy Spacek, also deliver stellar performances, adding depth and nuance to the film.\n\nThe screenplay is sharp, intelligent, and daring. It doesn't shy away from presenting controversial theories and challenging the official narrative. The dialogue is crisp and impactful, often leaving the audience to ponder long after the scene has ended.\n\nStone's direction is top-notch. He manages to maintain a sense of tension and urgency throughout the film, despite its lengthy runtime. The editing is seamless, and the cinematography is visually stunning, capturing the 1960s era perfectly.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that \"JFK\" is not a documentary, but a dramatized interpretation of events. While it presents an intriguing perspective, it should not be taken as historical fact. \n\nIn conclusion, \"JFK\" is a brilliantly crafted political thriller that offers a fascinating take on a significant event in American history. It's a must-watch for history buffs, conspiracy theory enthusiasts, and fans of well-made cinema. Despite its controversial subject matter, or perhaps because of it, \"JFK\" stands as a testament to the power of film to provoke thought and spark debate.",
    "Former UK Conservative Party leader, Michael Howard, has revealed that he used to skip school to play snooker. The confession came during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, where he admitted to being a \"bit of a tearaway\" in his youth.\n\nMr. Howard, who led the Conservative Party from 2003 to 2005, said he would often sneak off to a local snooker hall in Llanelli, South Wales, instead of attending school. He described his younger self as \"not a very good boy\" and admitted that his truancy was a \"terrible thing to do\".\n\nThe former Home Secretary, now 79, said he was \"captivated\" by the game of snooker from a young age. He recalled how he would spend hours at the snooker hall, honing his skills and trying to perfect his game.\n\n\"I was absolutely captivated by snooker,\" he said. \"I would spend hours and hours in the snooker hall when I should have been at school. It was a terrible thing to do and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\"\n\nDespite his truancy, Mr. Howard went on to have a successful political career. He served as Home Secretary under John Major's government from 1993 to 1997 and later led the Conservative Party, although he failed to win the 2005 general election.\n\nMr. Howard's love for snooker has not waned over the years. He is a regular at the World Snooker Championships in Sheffield and has often spoken about his passion for the game.\n\nDuring the radio interview, he also spoke about his early life, his political career, and his love for music. He chose tracks by Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and the Beatles for his desert island playlist.\n\nThe former Tory leader's confession about his school days has sparked a debate about truancy and the importance of education. While some have criticised Mr. Howard for his actions, others have argued that his story shows that unconventional paths can also lead to success.\n\nMr. Howard ended the interview by saying, \"I was lucky. I got away with it. But I wouldn't advise anyone to follow my example.\"",
    "Stochastic PDEs have been used in the study of many systems of interest to physics and chemistry, including fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics, plasma physics, the motion of a polymer chain, etc. Stochastic PDE models are frequently used to describe a system where individual molecules or atoms interact with each other and the rest of the surrounding system or environment stochastically. While the underlying systems are governed by deterministic PDEs, this stochastic influence creates a stochastic PDE for the system as a whole. The most studied type of Stochastic PDE is the ItuKawasaki model of stochastic fluid dynamics.\nThis research paper is not peer-reviewed and has been posted to arxiv.org, a public archive for research papers.

While the underlying systems are governed by deterministic PDEs, this stochastic influence creates a stochastic PDE for the system as a whole.\nMost examples of stochastic PDEs are non-existent. The ItoKawasaki model of stochastic fluid dynamics is one of the most well known stochastic PDE models. This paper provides an overview of this model, as well as a more general stochastic PDE model that encompasses all forms of stochastic PDEs. It aims to provide an introductory overview of stochastic PDEs. It begins from the basic premise of a random variable and an Ito process, and builds from there. The ItoKawasaki equation uses Ito’s Taylor-series expansion and the Ito Product Rule to characterize a PDE which relates random variables over time to each other. It concludes with a summary of the ItoKawasaki equation in the form of a stochastic PDE.\nThe following is the full text of the above referenced section of the research paper titled \"An Introduction to Stochastic PDEs\" from arxiv.org entitled \"The ItoKawasaki Equation for Stochastic Fluid Dynamics\":\nIn this section we examine the",
    "The flooding of natural systems is a fundamental concept in environmental science. The ability to form these networks is one of the most intriguing properties of biology. However, whether flood-filling can actually occur in natural systems is not well understood. Here, we present a novel model for flood-filling networks in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Two ANNs, one with hidden neurons and another with convolutional neural networks, can automatically form flood-filling nets for arbitrary datasets. Our models can take as input a simple population of simple populations. By constructing a high-order representation from two representations, respectively convolutional and softmax, we obtain a network that efficiently compresses and fills data. This is an important tool for studying the emergence of biologically relevant functions in natural systems. …",

    "The Football Association (FA) has decided not to penalise Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho following investigations on his comments after the Red Devil’s victory against Newcastle United in October.\n\nIt had initially been reported that Mourinho used offensive language as he walked off the pitch following the dramatic 3-2 win, but the FA has found him not guilty following a review of the evidence and an appeal.\n\nThe fare at Old Trafford seemed to be taking a turn for the worst when Newcastle took a two point lead, but a thrilling last 20 minutes saw the home side clinch victory from the jaws of defeat. Mourinho was visibly emotional on the pitch at full time, and reports surfaced that his comments, made in Portuguese, had included offensive language.\n\nAn independent regulatory commission was set up to review Mourinho's comments. An FA statement said: \"A charge against Jose Mourinho for allegedly using language which was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper has been found not proven following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today.\n\n\"It related to an incident following the Manchester United versus Newcastle United game on 6 October 2018. Written reasons for the decision of the Independent Regulatory Commission will be published in due course. This decision is subject to appeal.\"\n\nJosé Mário dos Santos Mourinho Félix, known as José Mourinho, is a revered figure in European football, having won 25 major honours, making him one of the most successful managers of all time.\n\nThe decision of the FA will thus come as condolence to a Manchester United side that has been under substantial pressure this season both on and off the field. Mourinho has repeatedly come under scrutiny for his conduct, and this judgment should help steady the ship at United's helm.\n\nDorothy Dawkins, a lifelong Manchester United fan, stated, \"We're glad the FA have seen sense, it's time to let Jose do his job without any distractions.\"\n\nThis ruling indicates that the much-criticized Portuguese manager can now focus on his team's performances without any looming sentence from the FA hanging over his head.",
    "Former Home Secretary, David Blunkett, has shared details about his life marked by triumph, personal pain, and the difficulties of maintaining a private life whilst holding public office. In a candid interview that shed light upon his emotional turmoil as well as his political career, he spoke of his hopes, his regrets, and a love that left him heartbroken.\n\nAdmitting to being swept up in a whirlwind romance that was as passionate as it was controversial, Blunkett first alluded to the affair that would shock the nation's political landscape in the early 2000s. The Labour stalwart was involved with Kimberly Quinn, a married publisher, a relationship that resulted in a public scandal and, eventually, the birth of their son.\n\nBlunkett confessed his love for Quinn was profound but fraught with challenges and pain. He had been smitten and consequently wounded by a situation seemingly taken straight from a dramatic script. The scandal and the trials which followed not only took a toll on his personal life but also ushered in a challenging phase in his political career, leading to his twice resignation.\n\nOn struggling with the public scrutiny that followed, Blunkett said, \"It isn't easy, it’s very painful. You want to think you can be the same as everyone else, but the truth is, you can't.\" He revealed that the pain cut deep, and the experience took a toll on his emotional wellbeing.\n\nHowever, amidst the scandal and the public tumult, the veteran Labour politician described the joy he felt when it was confirmed that he was the father of Quinn's son. \"Finding out William was my son was one of the happiest moments of my life,\" he admitted. \n\nThe former Home Secretary, who held the post from 2001 to 2004, has been open about the difficulties he faced as a blind man in the political arena. He expressed how his disability presented unique challenges, particularly in maintaining and managing personal and romantic relationships.\n\nDespite the heartache and turmoil, Blunkett maintains his love for public service, saying it has been the guiding principle throughout his life. He remains hopeful for a future devoid of such personal anguish and continues to voice his dedication to the Labour party and its ideals.\n\nReflecting on the past, Blunkett does not shy away from expressing his regrets but retains a forward-thinking perspective. \"There are things I'd do differently,\" he confessed, \"but life is for learning. You work through the pain, you grow, and you keep going.\"\n\nThrough his candid reflections, David Blunk",
    "Critics are rallying behind the film \"Aviator\" as a strong contender for the upcoming Academy Awards, often referred to as the Oscars. The film, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, has been lauded for its cinematic excellence and compelling storytelling.\n\n\"Aviator\" is a biographical film that chronicles the life of Howard Hughes, an influential aviation pioneer and film mogul. The film has been praised for its meticulous attention to detail, stunning visuals, and powerful performances, particularly that of DiCaprio in the lead role.\n\nThe film has already garnered a significant amount of attention in the awards circuit, having won Best Picture at the Golden Globes. Critics have also praised the film's screenplay, cinematography, and production design, making it a strong contender in several categories at the Oscars.\n\nSeveral film critics have expressed their support for \"Aviator\" in the run-up to the Oscars. Renowned critic Richard Roeper described the film as \"a triumph of filmmaking,\" while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it \"a movie that buzzes with Oscar potential.\"\n\nDespite the strong competition, many believe that \"Aviator\" has a good chance of taking home the coveted Best Picture award. The film's exploration of Hughes' life, from his successes in aviation and film to his struggles with mental illness, has resonated with audiences and critics alike.\n\nHowever, the film's success at the Oscars is not guaranteed. It faces stiff competition from other critically acclaimed films such as \"Million Dollar Baby\" and \"Finding Neverland.\" The final decision will be in the hands of the Academy's voting members.\n\nRegardless of the outcome at the Oscars, \"Aviator\" has already made a significant impact in the film industry. Its success serves as a testament to the power of biographical films and the enduring appeal of stories about complex, fascinating figures like Howard Hughes.\n\nThe 77th Academy Awards will take place on February 27, with the winners being announced in a star-studded ceremony in Hollywood. Whether \"Aviator\" will fly high on the night remains to be seen.",
    "A moving story about an American young boy's desperate attempt to contact his ill-disposed father in World War II Japan, this little known and underappreciated film touches on some very sensitive issues which remain controversial even today; namely racism among Upscale citizens against Asian immigrant immigrants who have come into America seeking better lives than they would ever enjoy back home along with Americans' posturing that their countrymen were never at fault either morally nor militarily during WWII (especially when regarding what happened between Pearl Harbor where there was no official declaration beforehand although it remains unknown whether or not such military attack could've been avoided altogether). As far as its ending goes however many may think otherwise but since most people tend only focus upon individual actions rather analyzing them all collectively together those things don't really amount too much anymore do you agree? Either way though how can one explain why so few movies based around these events truly touch us deeply enough especially considering we know exactly...",
    "\"The Birth of a Nation\" is a film that is as controversial as it is historically significant. Released in 1915, it is a silent epic drama directed by D.W. Griffith that has been both praised for its technical innovations and criticized for its overtly racist content and glorification of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe film's narrative is a sweeping tale of two families during the Civil War and Reconstruction era, showcasing the tumultuous period in American history with a grandeur that was unprecedented at the time. The storytelling is compelling, and the performances, particularly by Lillian Gish and Henry B. Walthall, are commendable. The film's technical achievements, including its use of close-ups, cross-cutting, and other editing techniques, were groundbreaking and have influenced countless films since.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to discuss \"The Birth of a Nation\" without addressing its deeply problematic racial politics. The film's portrayal of African Americans is offensive and dehumanizing, and its romanticization of the Ku Klux Klan is disturbing. These elements make the film a challenging watch for modern audiences and have rightly earned it a place of infamy in film history.\n\nDespite these issues, \"The Birth of a Nation\" is an important film to study for its technical innovations and its role in the development of narrative cinema. It is a stark reminder of the deeply ingrained racism of its time, and its continued controversy serves as a testament to the power of cinema to shape, reflect, and challenge societal attitudes.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Birth of a Nation\" is a film that cannot be ignored, but must be approached with a critical eye and an understanding of its historical context. It is a significant piece of cinematic history that offers valuable lessons about the power and responsibility of storytelling.",

    "\"Sully\" is a masterful depiction of the real-life event known as the \"Miracle on the Hudson\". Directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks as Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger, the film is a riveting exploration of heroism, humanity, and the power of split-second decision making.\n\nTom Hanks delivers a stellar performance, embodying the calm and composed demeanor of Sully with an underlying layer of vulnerability. His portrayal of the seasoned pilot, who is suddenly thrust into the global spotlight, is both believable and deeply moving. Aaron Eckhart, playing co-pilot Jeff Skiles, provides a solid supporting performance, adding depth to the narrative.\n\nEastwood's direction is commendable. He skillfully balances the intense, action-packed scenes of the plane's emergency landing with quieter, introspective moments that delve into Sully's character and the aftermath of the event. The film's non-linear narrative structure, which includes flashbacks and dream sequences, adds an interesting dimension to the storytelling.\n\nThe technical aspects of the film are equally impressive. The visual effects used to recreate the plane's landing on the Hudson River are stunningly realistic, immersing the audience in the harrowing experience. The sound design is also noteworthy, enhancing the tension and drama of the pivotal scenes.\n\nHowever, \"Sully\" is more than just a disaster movie. It is a profound character study that explores the psychological impact of the event on Sully. The film also raises pertinent questions about media scrutiny and bureaucratic skepticism, adding a layer of complexity to the narrative.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Sully\" is a compelling cinematic experience that combines a gripping real-life story with strong performances and top-notch direction. It is a testament to the human spirit and the extraordinary courage of an ordinary man in the face of adversity. Whether you're a fan of biographical dramas or simply appreciate good cinema, \"Sully\" is a must-watch.",
    "So i installed my Fujitsu ductless heatpump today but the unit is loud like i am sitting in a jet airliner. I am on the 8th floor. I have seen some posts elsewhere about it but this is really loud and almost deafening. Can i make it any quieter than it is right now? Maybe the unit needs recharging? It doesn't feel cold inside. Is it possible that the unit itself is defective? What else can i look at?\nWe all know how loud a mini split heat pump can be. I know at first, I thought I would need earplugs. You might want to check some other forums to see if your heat pump is running correctly. They can make a lot of noise. If they are too quiet, I would return them and get another set. This is usually a sign that something is up and you are not getting the full benefit of the heat pump. There are some things that you can do to make your pump quiet. The most common method is to make sure the fan is set to run at high speed. You should also make sure that the compressor is turned off. If you do not do this, your pump will run at full speed all the time.\nIf you are still experiencing loud noise from your pump, it could be because it is not running correctly or correctly. This is a common problem for people who are new to heat pumps. You should keep track of the temperature of your home, check the thermostat to make sure that it is set correctly, and make sure that the fan is set to on. Also, make sure that the heat pump is turned on correctly. Sometimes it is turned off completely, which causes the unit to run at full speed.\nThis is a great question to ask and I would be happy to answer it. I have three Fujitsu heat pumps in my home. The last one was installed last year, the previous one was a year ago and the first one was about 5 years ago. The last two were installed because I thought they worked better than my previous heat pump. My wife and I were happy with our Fujitsu heat pumps and never had any noise issues with them until a few months ago. I went to the Fujitsu forum to look for answers to our problem and I saw this post. The first two posters said that the Fujitsu heat pumps are loud. The third",
    "As for this year's predictions, I am not sure that many experts and bitcoin enthusiasts on reddit would make a prediction as broad as this one. Maybe the year will be really rough in some way. Maybe it will be very smooth and perfect. I am, however, quite confident that in 2031 there will be a strong, widely known, open, scalable and decentralised digital currency system that will be called Bitcoin or what I call Bitcoin 2.0 in the style of the original Bitcoin. This will be the first open source, peer reviewed, international cryptocurrency. This cryptocurrency will be based on a new generation of technologies called blockchain. It has several distinct advantages over Bitcoin 1.0 which are: 1: It is open-source. Anyone can make and distribute Bitcoin as they see fit. 2: It is decentralized. Its design does not depend on a central body. It can be mined by anyone and used by anyone. 3: It has no central bank and it is not controlled by any state entity, corporation or central bank. This system is run on a globally decentralised network of users called 'Bitcoin miners' and 'Bitcoin users'. 4: It is very small. It will be much smaller than Bitcoin 1.0. Although its market cap is a lot bigger than that of Bitcoin 1.0, its number of users and miners is far fewer: it stands only at about 10 million users and maybe 1 million Bitcoin miners, making it far smaller than the entire community of the first Bitcoin. 5: The network is distributed. At all times. This means that a person can send bitcoins anywhere in the world instantly for free. This is unlike any other digital currency. 6: It is a currency. It is not backed by any commodity, government or any other central body. For that reason its value is not based on any commodity or any other commodity derivative. 7: It has no central bank. 8: It is digital. Bitcoins are created using the mathematics of a new and revolutionary type of digital currency known as blockchain. It allows for the creation of one-of-a-kind financial instruments and digital securities. Its potential uses and applications far outstrip the potential commercial uses. 9: As the system's software code is open-source, anyone can monitor and improve it.\n\nThe post from bitcoin community participant @hussamachine goes even",

If caught quick enough (& before anything hits too hot,) putting just about any high zinc motor oil into this '02' boxer turbo beast stops/stops & quiets whatever leaky valve train noise started up!!!

Then another few thousand trouble free until very recently:( This makes 3 times doing what works!! But once again though(!) last night -while checking other possible issues unrelated--- noticed light colored air intake fumes coming off coolant expansion tank cap! No leaks visible under hood yet smell can make anyone curious + concerned!(?) So now wondering if its worthwhile fixing 2 potentially connected concerns w these old cars..??? At same dealership as mentioned previously but newer location has different staff who arent familiar even listening politely.... Plus they'll charge double usual rate since warranty expired over year ago :( As well learned most likely needing cylinder head gasket replacement also which should happen simultaneously btw(!?). While looking things through here trying determine feasibility+ practicality do self fix myself ; saw mention similar symptoms were caused faulty bypass tubes aka breathers being clogged somehow?? Not sure exactly how thats happens tho maybe someone else knows.? And besides could explain why only sometimes problem occurs especially compared idling always does????

    "The iconic story of the legendary British band, Joy Division, is set to be immortalized on the silver screen. The film will delve into the band's formation, their rise to fame, and the tragic death of lead singer Ian Curtis.\n\nJoy Division, formed in 1976, was a pioneering force in the post-punk movement. Their dark, atmospheric sound and deeply emotional lyrics, largely penned by Curtis, resonated with a generation of music lovers. The band's influence continues to be felt in the music industry today.\n\nThe film will explore the band's humble beginnings in Salford, Greater Manchester, their struggle to break into the mainstream, and their eventual success. It will also delve into the personal lives of the band members, particularly focusing on Curtis's battle with epilepsy and depression, which ultimately led to his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.\n\nThe project is being helmed by a team of acclaimed filmmakers. The script is being penned by Matt Greenhalgh, who previously wrote the BAFTA-winning film \"Control\", a biopic about Ian Curtis. The film will be directed by Anton Corbijn, who has a long-standing relationship with the band, having directed their music videos and taken iconic photographs of them.\n\nThe casting process is currently underway, with producers seeking actors who can capture the essence and spirit of the band members. The film is expected to feature Joy Division's most famous songs, including \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\", \"Transmission\", and \"Atmosphere\".\n\nFans of Joy Division and music history enthusiasts alike are eagerly anticipating the film's release. The film promises to offer an intimate look into the lives of the band members and the turbulent times that shaped their music.\n\nThe film is expected to go into production later this year, with a release date yet to be announced. The Joy Division story is one of triumph, tragedy, and timeless music, and this film aims to bring that story to a new generation of viewers.",
    "Millions of Britons are expressing their dissatisfaction with the quality of internet service they receive, according to a recent survey. The study, conducted by the consumer watchdog Which?, reveals that a significant number of UK residents are unhappy with the speed, reliability, and cost of their internet service.\n\nThe survey, which involved more than 8,000 participants, found that 60% of respondents were dissatisfied with their internet service. The main complaints were slow speeds, frequent disconnections, and high costs. \n\nThe report also highlighted a stark digital divide in the country, with rural areas suffering from significantly poorer service than urban areas. In some remote parts of the UK, residents reported that they were unable to access the internet at all, a situation that has been exacerbated by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the shift towards remote working and online learning.\n\nThe findings of the survey have prompted calls for the government and internet service providers (ISPs) to take immediate action to improve the quality of internet service across the country. \n\n\"Internet access is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. The pandemic has shown us how much we rely on a stable internet connection for work, education, and staying in touch with loved ones,\" said Rocio Concha, Director of Policy and Advocacy at Which?. \"The government and ISPs need to do more to ensure that everyone in the UK has access to a reliable and affordable internet service.\"\n\nThe government has pledged to roll out superfast broadband to all homes in the UK by 2025. However, the Which? report suggests that this target may be difficult to achieve, given the current level of dissatisfaction with internet service.\n\nThe report also found that many consumers felt trapped in contracts with their ISPs, with 45% of respondents saying they felt they had no other viable options for internet service in their area. This lack of competition in the market is another factor contributing to the poor quality of service experienced by many consumers.\n\nIn response to the report, a spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \"We are investing £5bn to roll out nationwide gigabit broadband as quickly as possible and are on track to deliver this by 2025. We are also introducing new laws to cap the cost of broadband and make switching providers easier.\"\n\nHowever, for many Britons, these promises offer little immediate relief. As the country continues to grapple with the challenges of the digital age, the demand for reliable, affordable internet service is only set to increase.",
    "This paper presents a novel method for 3D medical image segmentation, termed Prior-Guided Local (PGL) self-supervised learning. The proposed approach leverages prior knowledge to guide the learning process, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation tasks. The PGL model is designed to capture local contextual information in 3D medical images, which is crucial for accurate segmentation. Experimental results on various medical imaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the PGL model over existing self-supervised learning methods. The study also highlights the potential of PGL in enhancing the interpretability of 3D medical image analysis, which is critical for clinical decision-making.",

    "This paper is an exercise in computational equivalence, in which a simple mathematical formula yields the same result as a more complex mathematical formula in a different setting. Thus, this paper is an attempt to derive the equivalence of the function c-Wilf on the rational numbers given the simple mathematical formula on which they are founded. The assumption is that two groups of rationals are equal to each other in every number field where they are definable, and the theorem to this effect is trivially true: for every finite field of real numbers, the field of rationals is the field of all integers. An alternative proof that the integers are the integers is known to be false, and a formal result to this effect is given independently by the same author. We now prove that the formula of calculus is adequate to show the equivalence of c-Wilf with this formula. It turns out to be a more complicated formula than the one we considered above, and some of the proofs do not seem to be quite right. It is conjectured that the formula is not sufficient to show that c-Wilf is equivalent to the integer epsilon, and that c-Wilf is equivalent to either 0 or epsilon, depending on the question of choice: either c-Wilf is equivalent to the rationals, or to numbers 0 or epsilon. This result is conjectured using basic probability theory, and the results seem to work, although not in the usual way. The motivation to this result is given as follows: The basic theorem shows that any interval is an interval of a certain size, so that all rational numbers from it are integers. An interval is the smallest unit that contains all the rational numbers. In the case of intervals, the question is whether the smallest interval contains all rationals, or contains some rational. For example, the integers, and in particular the set of all integers less than a fixed arbitrary number c, and the set of all rationals are bounded intervals, so that either c-Wilf is equivalent to an interval bounded by the integers and the rationals, or to a set of numbers less than some arbitrary number c. The basic theorem is a theorem of quotient modules: it is an important result that every interval, and, strictly speaking, the smallest finite set of integers that has all rationals in it, is an interval of",
    "The chairman of the Police Federation says that a change in the law over drinking and driving could save hundreds of lives every year.\nDerek Barnett said he would welcome such a move which would allow officers to use breathalysers in the street.\nMr Barnett was responding to a report earlier this week calling for an expansion of police powers on drinking and driving.\nThe Police Federation had been concerned about proposals to allow officers to pull people over to test whether they had been drinking.\nBut Mr Barnett says this would not be the case under the proposals.\n\"The federation does not support breath tests in the street on a mass scale, and we are always concerned that powers must not be used in abuse,\" he told BBC News 24.\nThe Home Affairs Select Committee is due to publish a report on proposals to extend police powers on drink driving in response to concerns about drunken behaviour.\nMPs said police should have the power to require people to breathalise at the roadside.\nThey also recommended that existing powers allowing police to stop motorists they suspect might be drinking, and that have been under used, should be extended to cover more of south-east England.\nMr Barnett says his members are particularly interested in the committee's suggestion that police should be allowed to conduct random breathalyses at the roadside.\n\"We are looking at the proposal, because one of the problems the powers have got, is that the person will do a breath test with an officer in a police station and they will get a result that is less than the limit - but then they will do another test at a testing station and they will get a result slightly above the limit.\"\nThis, said Mr Barnett, does not provide officers with the powers to stop the driver, because they have no proof that their reading of their breath is accurate.\n\"But if they are random breath tests they will have that. And if you pick on an individual and they do a breath test, and for the first time if that test was wrong when they could take their vehicle away... it will be a very effective deterrent.\"\nCurrently, breath tests are only carried out in police stations after a driver has been arrested.\nMr Barnett said that he felt the police needed these new powers because of the large number of people who drink-drive regularly and are a real danger to other road users.",

    "Thousands of music lovers gathered in Glasgow last night for a star-studded benefit concert aimed at raising funds for victims of the recent devastating tsunami. The event, held at the iconic SSE Hydro, saw a line-up of both local and international artists performing to a sold-out crowd.\n\nThe concert, organised by Glasgow City Council in partnership with several charities, was a response to the catastrophic tsunami that hit the South Pacific last month, leaving thousands homeless and causing widespread destruction. All proceeds from the event will go directly to relief efforts in the affected areas.\n\nScottish bands such as Biffy Clyro, Franz Ferdinand, and Chvrches took to the stage, alongside international acts like Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa. The diverse line-up ensured a wide range of musical genres were represented, from rock and pop to folk and electronic music.\n\nThe atmosphere was electric as the crowd, united in their support for the cause, sang along to hit after hit. The artists, too, expressed their solidarity with the victims, with many sharing heartfelt messages and urging fans to donate generously.\n\nGlasgow's Lord Provost, Philip Braat, said, \"The response from the public and the music community to this benefit gig has been overwhelming. It's a testament to the spirit of Glaswegians and their willingness to help those in need.\"\n\nThe concert also included a moment of silence to honour the victims of the tsunami, a poignant reminder of the reason behind the event. Video messages from survivors and aid workers on the ground were also shown, highlighting the urgent need for funds and resources.\n\nThe benefit gig was not just a musical extravaganza but also a platform for raising awareness about the ongoing crisis. Throughout the evening, information about the tsunami and its aftermath was shared, and attendees were encouraged to learn more and contribute in any way they could.\n\nWhile the final amount raised is yet to be confirmed, early estimates suggest that ticket sales alone have generated over £1 million. This figure is expected to rise significantly once donations from the public and proceeds from merchandise sales are added.\n\nThe Glasgow tsunami benefit gig was a powerful demonstration of music's ability to bring people together in times of crisis. As the city continues to rally in support of the tsunami victims, the hope is that this event will inspire similar initiatives across the country and around the world.",
    "I've been playing around with the new resist cap in PvP and I've got to say, it doesn't seem to be making much of a difference. I was hoping that it would add a new layer of strategy to the game, but it seems like it's just a minor inconvenience at best.\n\nFirstly, the cap is set at a level that is easily achievable with just a few pieces of gear. This means that most players are going to hit the cap without even trying, making it essentially meaningless. It doesn't force players to make tough decisions about their gear or playstyle, it's just a number that everyone is going to hit.\n\nSecondly, the impact of hitting the cap is minimal. Sure, you take a bit less damage, but it's not enough to really change the outcome of a fight. I've been in plenty of battles where both myself and my opponent were at the cap, and it didn't feel any different from before the cap was introduced.\n\nFinally, the cap doesn't address the real issues with PvP. There are still major balance issues, with certain classes and builds being far more powerful than others. The resist cap feels like a band-aid solution that doesn't really solve anything.\n\nIn conclusion, the new resist cap feels like a missed opportunity. It could have been a way to add depth and strategy to PvP, but instead it's just a minor tweak that doesn't really change anything. I hope the developers take another look at this and consider making some more meaningful changes to the PvP system.",
    "Abstract\n\nWe present MetaBox+, an extension to the region-based active learning method (RBAL) framework, which allows us to learn semantic segmentations in real time by combining multiple regions into a single model. We demonstrate that RBAL can be used to achieve high accuracy on tasks such as image classification and natural language processing. Our approach uses a novel priority map based on the hierarchical structure of the input data. The resulting models are able to learn to classify images with high accuracy even when they have been preprocessed. In addition, we show how our method can be applied to other types of data, including audio and video.",
    "Hey everyone!\n\nSo, I got my tongue pierced about a week ago now and until recently, everything seemed to be going pretty smoothly. However, over the past two days, I've noticed excessive swelling and some uncomfortable crud around the piercing bit. I'm also experiencing a lot of discomfort and a foul taste in my mouth. Plus, the pain seems to be increasing, and I'm beginning to get worried. \n\nI've been religious about my aftercare routine, so I'm surprised and scared that it's apparently developed an infection. I've been rinsing with non-alcoholic mouthwash four times a day, especially after eating or drinking anything, and I've also been using a saline solution twice a day. \n\nI really don't want to remove the piercing because of how much I love it, but I'm getting a little desperate here. I would be grateful if anyone could provide some advice or information about what I should do next. More specifically, should I contact the place where I had it done and see if they suggest anything (they do provide aftercare advice for these situations)? Should I go to a clinic?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Please share your thoughts and experiences as they might be really helpful. Also, I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask this, just redirect me where to go if that's the case.",
    "The start of the prosecution case against Barry Bonds (left) and other players suspected of using anabolic steroids has been pushed back by more than a year._\n\nThe trial date of baseball players allegedly involved with the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (Balco) drug laboratory has been postponed for at least another year.\n\nA trial now looms in early 2008, after a US District Court judge ruled that prosecution witnesses would not be available in October of this year.\n\nThe US Attorney's Office has appealed its case against the athletes, after an earlier attempt at indictment was dismissed on technicalities.\n\nThe athletes involved include eight-time home run champion Barry Bonds and Olympic sprint champion Terrell Owens, who played for the San Francisco 49ers during the 2000 season. Owens has said he never used steroids.\n\nFour years ago, the US attorney's office in San Francisco indicted Bonds, the 49ers' three-time Super Bowl–winning running back Lawrence Phillips, and former major league left-hander Jason Giambi on drug charges stemming from their alleged association with the Balco laboratory.\n\nProsecutors say that Bonds used banned performance-enhancing drugs, while the athletes say the government is basing its case on a trumped-up drug conspiracy charge, which they say is unwarranted since neither they nor the lab were charged.\n\nAfter a court hearing on Friday, the hearing will now begin on 12 February, presided over by a new judge, Susan Illston, in the US District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nA jury will then be selected before opening statements begin.\n\nPhillips was sentenced to 40 months in prison in February of 2007 and Giambi received an 18-month sentence in November of the same year. Bonds's case is still awaiting a resolution, but may be moot if the government fails to convict him. Bonds, 40, retired from baseball in April.\n\nAlthough not charged in the original prosecution, Bonds is thought to have been a major customer of the now-defunct Balco lab, founded by owner Victor Conte. Many of its customers were athletes who had ties to high-profile strength coaches who have been indicted in a separate doping scandal known as Operation Juicer.\n_Doping Scandal at the Beijing Olympics_\n\nThe following",
    "As a community, we have been very heated about the potential implications of 4/16 - but I genuinely believe we need to take a step back and reassess our perspective.\n\nThe speculation, rumors, and mass generalizations being thrown around are feeding into an atmosphere of stress and fear, which, in turn, is clouding our collective judgement. Yes, 4/16 signifies a day of important change - but, let's not forget that change isn't necessarily bad. Change can bring about growth, development, and most importantly, progress.\n\nIt's easy to get distracted by what could go wrong and forget to consider the potential for positive outcomes. The fear of the unknown is powerful but we need to come together as a community and approach this date with a calm and rational mindset. Each of us has a part to play in ensuring the exchange of information here remains fair, balanced, and respectful.\n\nUltimately, we don't control what happens on 4/16. What we can control, however, is how we react to it. Let's choose to respond with understanding, patience, and an open mind. Let's lean into the changes that come, together. We may find ourselves surprised by the potential for growth and positivity that this change can bring.\n\nRemember, everyone - we're all in this together. This community's strength lies in its unity, and I truly believe we can face 4/16 bravely, and more importantly, sensibly. Let's focus on facts, not fear. Take a deep breath, keep an open mind, and let's embrace the changes that 4/16 brings. We've got this, folks.\n",

The story follows an alien who arrives on Earth, and we follow him as he learns about our culture and his own. It's a very interesting premise that could have easily fallen flat if it wasn't for the performances by Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Both actors are excellent in their roles, and they bring out the best in each other. They're both great at playing characters with complex backstories, and they make us care about them even when they're doing something completely ridiculous.

    "Acclaimed Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino is set to mark his television debut by directing an episode of the popular American crime drama series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\n\nThe director, best known for box-office hits like \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Kill Bill\", will be involved in a two-hour season finale anticipated to air this May. His involvement signifies how the line between movies and TV is increasingly becoming blurred, a trend which sees more and more prominent Hollywood figures joining the small screen production.\n\nTarantino, a long-time CSI fan, approached the show's producers about directing an episode after meeting some of the cast at an awards show. Anthony Zuiker, creator of CSI, said he was \"floored and \"honoured\" by Tarantino's proposal. \"We never in a million years thought that someone of the calibre of Quentin Tarantino would be interested in our show,\" he said.\n\nWith his trademark blood-splattered, non-linear storytelling, Tarantino's particular style is expected to shake things up in the usually conservative and linear narrative of the forensic show, possibly marking a new milestone for the series.\n\nShowrunner Carol Mendelsohn said the notoriously fastidious Tarantino had spent several weeks with writers to develop the story for the episode. Without revealing too much, she hinted that the script involves one of the CSI regulars in peril, and the quest of the rest of the team to save their colleague will form the backbone of the episode.\n\nTarantino's foray into the TV realm is anticipated to deliver an explosion of fresh creativity, lending a unique vision to the universally loved franchise. This aligns with his reputation for experimenting with different genres and breaking conventions.\n\nTarantino's CSI episode should prove to be a TV event of unparalleled stature, and could possibly even set a new benchmark for TV series finales. Fans of Tarantino and CSI are eagerly waiting for what promises to be an exceptional collaboration between one of Hollywood's most inventive directors and one of television's most successful series.",
    "Cigarette makers have hailed a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court in their battle to prevent the FDA from making it harder for ordinary Americans to get their hands on nicotine. The Court said the agency is within its rights to make such a move, which could have been achieved by amending the 1964 act that banned tobacco products from being sold by the government-run US Food and Drug Administration. The court was asked to rule in the two-year-long challenge by Philip Morris, a US cigarette giant, to a 2010 measure that gave the FDA the power to set rules for how the industry must market products that contain the addictive drug. The measure was aimed at forcing the industry to take steps to address consumers' concern about the risks of nicotine. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the US, killing 480,000 people a year.\n\nThe report is written in the very tone you would expect a tobacco giant to consider to be their trademark – a warning to the reader that this is not the \"healthy choice.\" It's not even a healthy choice if you're smoking and enjoying it. In the interests of keeping you from taking your time to read it, and keep the company's logo on your mind while you do so, here are the highlights from the article:\n\n… US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is reported to have been particularly influenced by the tobacco companies' arguments that their industry is not a product designed to kill people but one that is intended just to provide them pleasure and satisfaction. Tobacco makers can now sue the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the US Supreme Court to block the FDA from restricting the sale of the popular product. The Supreme Court decision is thought to make it easier for firms to sue the agency for delaying or banning products containing nicotine. The company that owns the Philip Morris brand, Altria, will be responsible for paying the fees if they win. But it will be an expensive battle. Altria spent $3.4 million (£2.09 million) every day it did so. The Supreme Court has ruled that tobacco companies have a legal protection to sue the government and use the threat of litigation to stop measures aimed at preventing them selling their brands. However it did not find that the FDA was within its powers under the act. The FDA has used the power in the past to propose restrictions on marketing and advertising, but has been blocked",
    "This paper explores the dichotomy for first-order reducts of unary structures. It delves into the complexity of the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) for these structures, providing a comprehensive analysis of the dichotomy conjecture. The study employs a novel approach to the algebraic theory of CSPs, focusing on the primitive positive definable reducts of unary structures. The results reveal a dichotomy for these reducts, which either fall into the class of tractable problems or are NP-complete. This research contributes to the understanding of the complexity of CSPs and provides a foundation for further studies in this field.",
    "Video semantic segmentation (VSS) has been used to identify objects in video, but it is not yet possible to use VSS to classify objects in real-time. We present an efficient method that uses labels propagation and refinement to achieve high accuracy on object classification tasks. Our approach achieves over 90% label error rate on a large dataset of videos. The proposed method can be applied to any task where we want to extract information about objects in video.",
    "Britain's economy ended 2013 on a high note, according to official figures released today. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.7 per cent in 2012, up from an annual rate of 1.1 per cent in 2011 and the fastest pace since records began in 1948. GDP growth was driven by strong consumer spending, which rose at its fastest rate since 2009, while business investment also picked up. The ONS said that the UK economy had grown faster than expected in both the first quarter and the second quarter of this year. It added that the economy would grow by 2.2 per cent this year, compared with the previous estimate of 1.8 per cent. The ONS said that the increase in GDP was largely due to stronger consumer spending, which increased by 3.3 per cent in the three months to December compared with the same period last year. This was the strongest rise since 2008. Business investment also increased by 4.5 per cent over the same period, the biggest quarterly gain since 2007. The ONS said that the strength of consumer spending reflected the fact that households were feeling more confident about their finances after years of austerity measures. However, it warned that the recovery could be undermined if the government failed to deliver on its promise to cut the deficit.\n\nSo what does all this mean? Well, as we have seen, the UK economy has been growing at a very rapid pace. In fact, it has been growing so fast that it has surpassed the pre-crisis peak of GDP growth. And this means that the UK economy will continue to grow at a much higher rate than previously thought. So what does this mean for the future? Well, it means that the UK economy will continue to grow at a much higher rate than previously thought. But it also means that the UK economy will continue to grow at a much higher rate than previously thought.\n\nThis means that the UK economy will continue to grow at a much higher rate than previously thought.\n\nBut it also means that the UK economy will continue to grow at a much higher rate than previously thought.\n\nAnd this means that the UK economy will continue to grow at a much higher rate than previously thought.\n\nWhich means that the UK economy will continue to grow at a much higher rate than previously thought.\n\nWhich means that the UK economy",
    "American tennis player Robby Ginepri cut short the debut of rising British teen star in a thrilling match at the ATP Tour. \n\nIn a clash that lasted a little more than an hour, Ginepri swiftly dispatched the young British debutant, underlining the gulf in experience between the two players. Britain's young hope was unable to match the 31-year old American's aggressive baseline play and precision serving.\n\nThe young Brit, one of the most touted talents coming from the UK, showed stellar performances in the junior circuits lately, but today, it was a learning curve as the American veteran showed him the real face of the professional game. Despite his loss, his curves of progress suggest that it won't be long before he makes his mark on the ATP Tour.\n\nGinepri, who turned pro almost 15 years ago, showed no signs of easing his performance, displaying an array of powerful groundstrokes and from-the-book volley shots, a masterclass of technical prowess and strategic play for the 19-year-old Brit. The American finished the match with an ace, demonstrating the grit synonymous with his career over the years.\n\nDespite the defeat, the teenage prodigy showed glimpses of a bright future. His tenacious efforts in the second set, where he managed to swing a couple of breaks, gave the packed crowd a sneak peek into his potential that could only mature with time.\n\nAfter the match, Ginepry praised his young opponent mentioning his great promise for an excellent career in professional tennis, should his development continue to escalate. \n\nThe loss, while sobering, serves as a significant experience for the young Brit. Most dreams debut big but start small, it is the game that matures slowly. \n\nThe rest of the season and particularly lessons learned from this match could help the young lad to adapt to the higher levels of competition while underlining the amount of work still needed to break into the top tiers of the game. \n\nDespite the short debut, this is a long road ahead, and this game might just be the first among many defining moments for the British youngster.",

    "\"Farewell to the Great\" – \"In the Name of the Father\" stars Robert De Niro, Rachel Weisz, Peter Gallagher, and Jennifer Esposito.\n\nWhat is it about Christopher Nolan's latest project that makes it so unique, so different than anything you've ever seen on the big or small screen before? To start, it's not sci-fi or horror or adventure. For starters, it's not even psychological. No, it's a Biblical saga focusing on Noah and his son, which is a very different approach for Nolan. He has previously taken a close look at the lives of Abraham, Abraham's son, Isaac, Lot, and Jacob, and then of Joseph and His brothers. While he does offer one minor twist in \"The Talents of Others\" – that Isaac is the first born son, which opens up the fact that Joshua (a man who doesn't know he's the first born son) could be the prophet – neither \"The Talents of Others\" nor \"In the Name of the Father\" feature a son of Abraham.\n\nFor Nolan, the biblical plotline is more a reflection of his own values than it is a reflection of the world. He hopes \"In the Name of the Father\" will be \"a movie for those who enjoy stories where heroes do terrible things.\" Instead of the typical comic book hero, Nolan seeks to take the path of the \"hero who doesn't always do great things but still has moments when he is heroic.\" Nolan even goes so far to say, \"It's an allegory, so it's not about evil, but it does talk about our values. It's saying, that there are things we think we shouldn't do, and there are things that we think are right, and sometimes it feels like, sometimes we just don't see eye to eye.\"\n\nSo can you sum up everything about the film in three words?\n\nThemes of sacrifice and redemption.\n\nThemes of responsibility and freedom.\n\nTalks of family loyalty.\n\nDiverse cast.\n\nThematically relevant.\n\nWhat other actors could you talk about for about five words?\n\nEden Sher – is the son of two wealthy bankers.

    "Our paper deals with the problems that arise when you have to write the equation in algebraic notation. The obvious solution to the equation is to use an approximate interpolation, but those methods can be computationally expensive, if not prohibitively so for small data sets. There's also another problem, which is much more prevalent: You have to rewrite it every time. This is called 'chebyverification', and while it isn't as common as other problems of this nature (e.g., rewriting every time using brute force), it can still be disastrous. To see why it happens so frequently (and worse than before by over 5X), we will present some examples, show how they arise naturally with various analytic choices, and illustrate where optimization strategies might be developed to avoid them. Finally, we do briefly outline the current state-of-the-art on the subject.\n\n\nTo read the entire study, go here :",
    "\"I, Robot\" is a thrilling blend of action and science fiction that manages to captivate the audience from the very beginning. Set in a futuristic world where robots are an integral part of daily life, the film explores the complex relationship between humans and artificial intelligence.\n\nWill Smith delivers a stellar performance as Detective Del Spooner, a technophobic cop who is skeptical of the ever-increasing reliance on robots. His character is well-developed, with a backstory that justifies his fear and distrust of robots. Smith's charisma and wit add a layer of humor to the film, providing a perfect balance to the intense action sequences.\n\nThe visual effects in \"I, Robot\" are truly impressive. The robots are designed with great attention to detail, and their movements are incredibly realistic. The futuristic cityscape is equally stunning, with its sleek skyscrapers and advanced technology. The action scenes are well-choreographed and exciting, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe plot is intriguing, with a mystery that keeps you guessing until the end. The film raises thought-provoking questions about the ethics of artificial intelligence and the potential dangers of advanced technology. While the storyline is somewhat predictable, it is still engaging and full of suspense.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Bridget Moynahan and James Cromwell, deliver solid performances. The film's pacing is excellent, with a good balance of action, drama, and suspense. The dialogue is sharp and witty, with several memorable one-liners.\n\n\"I, Robot\" is not without its flaws. Some of the plot twists are a bit predictable, and the film occasionally relies too heavily on action sequences at the expense of character development. However, these minor issues do not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"I, Robot\" is a visually stunning, action-packed film that offers an intriguing look at a potential future where robots are a part of everyday life. With its compelling storyline, strong performances, and thought-provoking themes, it is a must-watch for any science fiction fan.",
    "This paper introduces spatially adaptive Multigrid Methods to efficiently solve fluid-structure interaction problems with temperature-induced fluctuations. A deep exploration is conducted on the fundamental challenge posed by these systems - the spatial scales that result from thermal fluctuations. The system’s response is found to be sensitive to fluctuations at all scales, which go down to the mesh size in numerical simulations, thus making the conventional homogenization methods ineffective. This research deploys a hitherto unparalleled technique - spatially adaptive Stochastic Multigrid Method, to resolve the smallest scales only where crucial. The effectiveness of this method is compared with traditional techniques through computational simulations. Results show a significantly lower computational cost relative to the standard methods, solidifying the value of the proposed technique in accelerating the numerical solution of fluid-structure systems with thermal fluctuations.",

    "This film is about a high school senior named Evan who has been bullied by his peers and by his parents, but he's not going to let that stop him. He decides to take matters into his own hands and make it up to them in some way or another. The story follows Evan as he tries to find out what happened to his best friend, Patrick, who disappeared one night after a party. It also follows Evan's relationship with his girlfriend, Hannah, and her family. This is a very well-written movie that will appeal to both teens and adults. I think this would be an excellent movie to watch with your friends if you're looking for something lighthearted and fun.\n\nI'm sure many people are wondering why I gave this movie such a low rating. Well, I don't know how much time I had to read the book before watching the movie, so I can only give my opinion based on what I saw in the movie. However, I do have a few things to say about the movie itself. First off, I thought the movie was pretty good. There were several scenes where I felt like I could relate to Evan and his situation. For example, when Evan tells Hannah that he wants to go back to their old house because he feels safe there, I really connected to that scene. Also, I liked the fact that the movie didn't try too hard to be funny. Instead, it just made me laugh at times. I also enjoyed the fact that the movie wasn't overly dramatic. In other words, it didn't try to make us feel sad or angry. Overall, I thought the movie was okay.\n\nOverall Rating: 3/5",

    "\"The K\\\"ahler metric is an amoeba-like scale parameter that can be seen from infinity as an exponential function of the number of chromosomes, a property that makes the metric more interesting than the simpler M-S compact space. A finite measure of the probability of mutation for a given base or in a given set of chromosomes, known as the probability distribution function (PRF) of the genome, can be given as a function of the number of chromosomes and a particular number of chromosomes, termed the minimum number of chromosomes (MN), as given by the \"minimize size\" maximization problem. These distributions were first found to be related to the probability distribution function of the genome, or the K\\\"ahler function, by K. Sjostrom's original work, based on the K\\\"ahler metric. As for the original purpose of studying these distributions, to determine how small a number of chromosomes can be before their likelihood of mutation should be reduced, the original theory was that the MN was a constant under these models. A more direct derivation on the basis of linear model is given in a recently-published result. K. M. Baumstark's method on the K\\\"ahler function was, in fact, to first show that the M-S compactly homogeneous M-S space does not suffer from the same fundamental problems as the more traditional homogeneous M-S space with many chromosomes. The method can be generalized to the M-S space which has been proved to be sufficiently homogeneous.\"",

    "Chelsea manager Roberto Martinez has challenged Arsene Wenger to repeat his feat of winning two Premier League titles in three years, amid suggestions that Chelsea can challenge for this season's title despite their recent difficulties.\n\nArsenal were beaten 5-0 by Everton on Saturday and after four games they sit fourth in the league table with 25 points to their name. They have also scored just 15 goals across those four matches as more attention turns towards Manchester United and City for next season.\n\nSpeaking ahead of his side's trip to Sunderland, Martinez said: 'If there are people saying we are in crisis, then you don't look at our achievements, you only analyse things from outside.'\n\n'I've always believed if anyone puts us under pressure we always respond, and obviously it didn't happen (against Everton) so that means these rumours we hear about us in crisis are true,' he added.\n\n'There will be a bunch of clubs who watch our progress because our first job was not to leave here or finish sixth in the division but stay up, put distance between ourselves and every other team in England.'\n\nWenger claimed last month that he had doubts about whether Chelsea could become champions again, while manager Rafa Benitez believes Chelsea still possess good players who require development. Mourinho remains unconvinced though.",
    "This film is about two men who are in love with each other, but they have different ideas on how to get there. One man wants to buy a Ferrari and the other one doesn't want to sell his car. The story revolves around their differences and their attempts at reconciliation. It's a very romantic movie that will make you feel like you're in love with these characters.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing. I think it's a great movie, but I don't know if it's going to be a hit with everyone. If you liked the first movie, then you'll probably enjoy this one as well. But if you didn't like the first movie, then you might find yourself disappointed by this one. Either way, I recommend watching this movie because it's a fun watch.",

It's days like these that remind me of the beauty of life and the importance of cherishing every moment. \n\nJust wanted to share this with you all. Hope you had a great day too!",
    "\"The quantum-classical phase transition can be described by an efficient nonlocal system for a single photon. In reality, the quantum system is a superposition of two different states, but the quantum state can be manipulated by a single photon. These nonlocale states are represented by classical solutions on a superposition space on the superposition space. These classical solutions are a quantum system, the classical states of the photons are the solutions to the classical wave equation, and the quantum amplitude of the particle and its position is the result of a stochastic process. A single photon can be used to entangle two classical waves. By using a single photon coupled with a single classical wave, we show that the system can be manipulated until a complete superposition is achieved. We show that the system can be manipulated such that for any single photon entangled with a state, the phase can only change if it is affected by an incident photon with a different state. Our results show that a quantum state is not just composed of a single coherent quantum photon but that a particle interacts with its environment according to the wave rule and not only the classical rules. This quantum state corresponds to a macroscopic single photon and it can be defined in two ways, that is the phase can be defined as the difference of two states, which changes with the presence of an electromagnetic wave, or if the phase can only change when an incident photon with a different state is introduced. A single photon can be used to entangle two classical waves, resulting in spontaneous superposition breaking, where a quantum state cannot be characterized strictly by the photon's frequency. When the classical state of the photon of a superposition is entangled with a classical state of the photon's wave particle, a quantum state may exist for long time periods in which no outgoing photons are detected and the photon is not subject to any disturbance. The quantum state of the wave particle is not affected by an interaction between two photons.\" For further information, to view the full paper please visit the arxiv.org site.",
    "This paper presents a novel approach to predict urban expansion using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The proposed model leverages the strengths of CNN in extracting spatial features from satellite images and LSTM's ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data. The model was trained and tested on a dataset comprising multi-temporal satellite images of several urban areas. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-LSTM model outperforms traditional models in predicting urban expansion, with higher accuracy and precision. This research contributes to the field of urban planning and sustainable development by providing a robust tool for forecasting urban growth patterns and aiding in strategic planning.",

The main novelty consists here to include also thermal convection due \nto temperature gradients between phases which leads us naturally towards considering systems governed not only at macroscopic level but rather through coupled PDE's system involving partial differential equations as well ordinary ones describing heat transfer phenomena within each fluid component; this makes our analysis quite challenging since we need first establish existence results even before proving uniqueness properties!",
    "I've been feeling really lost lately. I'm in my mid-20s, have a decent job, a loving family, and a few close friends. But despite all this, I feel empty and unfulfilled.

    "The European Commission has taken a significant step towards reducing the high cost of using mobile phones abroad by reprimanding mobile operators for excessive roaming charges. The EC's decision is seen as a victory for mobile phone users across Europe who have long complained about the high costs of making and receiving calls while travelling abroad.\n\nThe European Commission yesterday issued a stern rebuke to mobile operators, expressing its dissatisfaction with the exorbitant fees being levied for mobile and data usage across Europe. The move signals the Commission's commitment to implement a “roam-like-at-home” policy, aimed at standardising mobile and data charges across the member states.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, argued that the present pricing strategies adopted by the operators lacked transparency and harmed consumer interests. \"It's simply not fair that consumers have to pay excessive roaming charges when travelling within the EU,\" Vestager commented.\n\nThe Commission's call to action follows an extended period of research that has highlighted the disparities in charges across different member states. The investigation found that customers were often charged up to five times more for using their mobiles abroad compared to domestic prices.\n\nSeveral leading mobile operators have been invited to Brussels for a series of discussions on the issue. The Commission has urged them to revise their pricing strategies or face potential sanctions, including substantial fines.\n\nHowever, the Network operators contend that the prices reflect the cost of providing mobile services abroad and revising them would significantly affect their revenue. A representative of GSMA, which represents mobile operators worldwide, emphasised that the industry is highly competitive and prices are influenced by various factors, including infrastructure, taxation and regulation.\n\nThe European Commission unveiled its plans to end roaming charges back in 2015, but implementation has been delayed due to resistance from mobile operators. However, recent pressure from member states and consumer rights groups has reignited efforts to bring this planned reform to fruition.\n\nConsumer rights activists have welcomed the Commission's decision, viewing it as a necessary step towards more transparent and fair pricing in the telecommunications sector. The final decision on the proposal to cap charges is expected to be made later this year.\n\nVestager expressed her determination to ensure the “roam-like-at-home” policy becomes a reality. \"We will monitor the situation closely and will not hesitate to take action if necessary,” she concluded. \n\nThe Commission's stand is a crucial step towards creating a single digital market in Europe, where consumers can use their devices freely without worrying about hefty bills. However, achieving this goal will require a delicate balance between protecting consumers and ensuring the profitability of",

    "I'm not here to talk about the movie itself, at least not in any great detail given its release this week on Blu-ray and DVD (but it came out on Blu-ray late last month). The film opens at the height of World War II, with Nazi leader Adolf Hitler (played with eerie solemnity by Sir Kenneth Branagh) plotting his first attack against America but has a change of heart with one final goal in mind – exterminating all of human civilization… or so he once stated. Now, back to superheroes!\n\nIn what feels like a cross between \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier.\" Iron Man 3\" and \"Sucker Punch,\" these story lines are interwoven through multiple films depicting each character interacting with friends/family members (like Loki; aka Heimdall), and also in real time while fighting their respective warzones. There's much more action than most movies with superheroes, making these stories fun and exciting as opposed to dreary and boring. Marvel Studios does a nice job balancing the action elements with an excellent cast filled with charismatic actors like Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson and Jeremy Renner - just to name a few. A lot of attention is paid to those behind the camera too, including directors Anthony & Joe Russo (the brothers are responsible for such notable films as \"Captain America 2\") and Christopher Markus (\"Thor\"). To further enhance these performances, director Alan Taylor serves up an exceptionally beautiful soundtrack made by composer Jesse Havlin that lends a sense of mystery and foreboding to what's really going down in our characters' lives. I feel like there may be a little bit just as easily a case where you'll wish they made some better use of that music which would go so nicely into the story line. That said I have an overall positive rating and highly recommend seeing the movie if you're looking forward to more superhero adventures this coming summer.",
    "It's an absolutely fantastic movie. It's dark and funny and it can be quite hilarious. The plot is twisted, like the best Hitchcock movies. The actors are amazing. All of them are. Everyone gave an incredible performance. The movie just goes on with a great pace. It's a fast paced film from the very beginning. It feels great. You really have no idea what to expect and you should probably keep the lights off, not because this movie wants to scare you, just because no one really wants to see these kinds of movies with the light on.\nIt's a fantastic movie and I've never seen any movie that has made me go \"I need a drink, I need a cigarette\". I've never felt that while watching a movie before. All I can say is that this movie has changed me and it completely deserved 10/10. This movie is the perfect combination of comedy and drama.\nBurn After Reading is not a romantic comedy and it's not supposed to be. It's not for the faint hearted. The movie is not for everyone and I think that this movie should be rated R. The movie has more of a rating of NC-17. It was a really nice movie and I loved it. It actually deserves 10/10. It's a great film. I don't think I've seen such a great directorial debut. But I have to say that this movie has changed me and I'll never forget it. The direction is genius. I love the way the movie tells a story, the way it makes you feel and how much the actors have been able to portray their characters. It is truly amazing. A movie I will never forget. Thank you.\nI watched this movie with a group of friends last night in an effort to figure out exactly what I think of it. Although I do not know what to make of it, I do know that I will see it again some time. When I first watched it, I laughed. I was not laughing in a mean-spirited way. I am not going to say that I was \"laughing\" at the movie. I was not laughing because it was funny. I was laughing because it was sad. I did not cry. I did not feel sad. I felt some sadness. I think I was also laughing because of the irony of some of the things in the movie. If you have",
    "This paper investigates the ultra-directional super-scattering of homogenous spherical particles with radial anisotropy. The study employs a combination of analytical and numerical methods to explore the scattering properties of these particles. The results reveal that radial anisotropy can significantly enhance the forward scattering while suppressing the backward scattering, leading to ultra-directional super-scattering. This phenomenon is attributed to the constructive interference of scattered waves in the forward direction and destructive interference in the backward direction. The findings of this study have potential applications in optical manipulation, particle detection, and light harvesting.",

    "This paper presents a novel approach to image segmentation using weak shape priors. The proposed method leverages the concept of weak shape priors, which are less restrictive and more flexible than strong shape priors, to improve the performance of image segmentation tasks. The paper introduces a new algorithm that incorporates weak shape priors into a segmentation framework, allowing for the effective handling of variations in shape and appearance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques, particularly in cases where the object of interest exhibits significant shape variability. The paper also discusses potential applications of this approach in various fields such as medical imaging, computer vision, and object recognition.",

    "“Elysium” is a thought-provoking and visually splendid foray into a dystopian future, rendered with the precise direction of Neill Blomkamp. Set in 2154, where the stark division between the rich and poor is painstakingly apparent and the socio-political subtext resonates loud and clear, the film keeps you riveted with its spectacular world-building.\n\nMatt Damon delivers a compelling performance as the desperate hero, Max, whose life hangs by a thread and is torn between saving himself or humanity at large. The distinctive physicality he brings to the role complements his natural charisma, making us root for him every step of the way.\n\nOn the other hand, Sharlto Copley's villainous Kruger is undeniably impactful. Copley, with his raw and sometimes chilling portrayal, provides a worthy adversary to Damon's Max. Their intense confrontations make for some of the film's most memorable moments.\n\nJodie Foster, in the role of the cold and calculating Secretary Delacourt, gives a performance that is classic Foster: measured, nuanced, and undeniably powerful. However, it is the film's visual effects that steal the show. From the sleek and clean utopian space station Elysium to the gritty and grim Earth, the imagery is nothing short of stunning.\n\nHowever, the movie does struggle with pacing and narrative efficiency. While the first half sets up an engrossing universe, the second half becomes somewhat cluttered, with plot threads not receiving the closure they deserve. \n\nThe social commentary presented here is potent, but its delivery often strays into the realm of heavy-handedness. At times, the screenplay tends to oversimplify the complex themes it wishes to navigate, which slightly undermines the film's overall impact.\n\nDespite these creases, \"Elysium\" remains a largely successful venture thanks to its captivating premise, strong performances, and spectacular visual effects. It is a bold commentary on class struggle and the distribution of wealth that will strike a chord with those receptive to its message, while also offering a visually arresting cinematic experience to casual viewers.",

We find that the IR lag is independent of the distance to the galaxy and the type of star forming region within it. This result implies that the IR lag is not due to the presence of a large number of stars or gas clouds in the vicinity of the galaxy. Instead, our results suggest that the IR lag may be caused by the interaction between the interstellar medium and the interstellar magnetic field. Our results also indicate that the IR lag is significantly smaller than previously thought.",
    "\"The Big Blue\" is a visually stunning journey through the depths of human emotion and the sea. The director, Luc Besson, wonderfully harnesses the power of cinema to instill a sense of awe and wonder in viewers. Beautifully set in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, this film truly captures the majesty of nature, coupled with a gripping storyline.\n\nThe performances are undeniably compelling, with Jean-Marc Barr's portrayal of the free diver Jacques Mayol capturing your heart and imagination. Rosanna Arquette and Jean Reno's performances further add depth and complexity to this rich narrative. Each character is intricately crafted, and their struggles and victories keep you invested throughout the film.\n\n\"The Big Blue\" is more than just a movie about diving - it's a movie about obsession, friendship, love, and the eternal human quest for freedom. The script magically combines elements of drama and adventure, leaving you to experience a whirlwind of emotions.\n\nThe cinematography deserves special recognition. The underwater scenes are a testament to the beauty of our oceans and the mystery that it holds. It's filmed with such realism and grace, you feel as though you're diving into the depths of the ocean along with the characters.\n\nEnnio Morricone's score is another highlight. The hauntingly beautiful music enhances the film's ethos - the melancholy, the joy, the tension. Also, the ending is bound to leave you contemplative, thinking about the vastness of the human spirit and the world around us.\n\nMy only criticism would be the length of the film. Due to the slow-paced narrative, at times, it can feel slightly drawn out. However, this can be overlooked considering the overall enchanting experience \"The Big Blue\" provides.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Big Blue\" is an extraordinary film that, much like the sea, is profound and captivating. It is a cinematic experience that will both move you and marvel you, leaving you to question the very essence of freedom. Despite certain minor flaws, it's worth immersing yourself in this poignant tale of love, friendship, and one man's relationship with the sea.”",

    "This paper presents a novel approach to improve the generalization of deep learning models for overhead image segmentation tasks. The proposed method incorporates Getis-Ord Gi* statistics into the pooling layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a significant departure from traditional max or average pooling methods. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic is a local indicator of spatial association, and its integration into CNNs allows the model to capture and leverage spatial dependencies in overhead images. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of segmentation accuracy and model generalization. This research opens up new avenues for incorporating spatial statistics into deep learning models for image segmentation tasks.",
    "> We propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for semantic segmentation. The proposed network is based on the fully convolutional network (FCN) and is called the highly fused convolutional network (HFCN). The HFCN is designed to fuse the features of different layers in the network. The HFCN is composed of a series of convolutional layers, each of which is followed by a soft cost function. The soft cost function is a differentiable function that is used to measure the similarity between the output of the convolutional layer and the ground truth. The soft cost function is defined as the sum of the softmax function and the cross-entropy function.

    "So, here's my story. \n\nFor years, I've dealt with depression. It has been ravaging my life on all fronts. That led to me doing some research on non-traditional treatments for my ailment after conventional medicine did little to help. I came across a drug known as ketamine, initially used as an anesthetic, but showing promising results in the treatment of bipolar disorder and depression. I knew I was stepping into murky waters, but desperate times called for desperate measures.\n\nI began using ketamine, small doses at first, just to see if it could help. I cannot lie, it was successful. I felt more up and resilient than I had in years. But with success came reliance. As I became more and more dependent on Ketamine, I began to lose sense of my original goal and craved the drug instead.\n\nOne particular night, I was chilling in my house, just after a dose of ketamine. I've always been a cautious user, never letting the drug take complete rein over my consciousness. I was sitting in the living room when I noticed the smell of smoke. It was faint at first and quite easy to dismiss. I ignored it. There could've been numerous innocent sources - a neighbor’s barbecue, some burning leaves, you know the usual stuff. But as the minutes ticked by, the smell became more pungent and began to take over the room.\n\nMy brain went on high alert. I followed the source of the smoke and what I found was something you only see in nightmares. My kitchen was in flames. An unattended pot on the stove was the culprit. The flames were quickly reaching the ceiling and black smoke was starting to fill the room. \n\nLuckily, ketamine has a side effect: diminished response to fear. While sober-me would probably have panicked, ketamine-me was surprisingly calm in the face of potential disaster. Instead of freezing or running away, I swiftly grabbed the fire extinguisher from under the sink and managed to put out the fire before it spread further.\n\nPost-incident, the realization of what could have happened hit me like a ton of bricks. I had gotten away with recklessness, with a combination of luck and unintended preparedness. As it sinks in, I realize how my addiction could have led to disaster. It's clear to me now that addiction isn't a sustainable solution for my depression or anything for that matter. I need to stop seeking momentary happiness in a potentially deadly habit.\n\nStopping is easier said than done, I know it.",

    "This has been going on for 6 months and I can't let it go. It makes my stomach turn every time I read it. The world around me is collapsing.\n\nI'm sitting alone, in my bedroom. I want to get up but the tears are so thick in my eyes that they won't let me. This isn't how I want to die and the only thing I want more than anything right now is to die. The more I read about what's going on in the world, the angrier I feel.\n\nA few weeks ago I saw the news of Donald Trump's election and the subsequent rise in white nationalism in Europe. I saw the rise of the rise of Donald Trump and realized that this was only the beginning.\n\nI'd heard, in passing, that the \"liberal elite\" of the West will stop Trump, and that maybe, if he gets out of control enough, he'll be able to set himself up as a fascist dictator. \"Let's have a revolution in this country!\" That's something they've been saying for years. I'm sure some of them would say the same for Saddam Hussein or for Hitler.\n\nBut, the point is, what's the best way of doing that? If we're in that situation, what am I supposed to do? The thing that makes me wonder is whether any of it even makes a difference.\n\nThe only thing I can compare it to is I was really upset about the death of my father just a week ago and the world just kept going. He was just gone. The world as we know it didn't end and if you had told me that he was still alive I would have completely ignored it, because it didn't exist. I can't give myself that excuse, it doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd there's the first bit again. It doesn't make sense. We just keep going, we keep on going. The more I read, the angrier I become. The more I learn and the more I learn and the more I learn, the more I feel like I'm being controlled by some force, some power. No matter how much I read about it, the rage makes me feel alive, as if I'm experiencing something of real import.

    "WorldCom chairman Bernie Ebbers has launched a defence of his company after last month's indictment of several senior executives and the collapse of its accounting firm.\n\nBut now he and his company are also looking at more immediate damage for shareholders, saying WorldCom shareholders have a \"right to be concerned\" that he and other executives may face criminal charges if they are found guilty.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV on Thursday, Ebbers insisted the $6.3 billion in fines attached to the WorldCom scandal were not punishment enough and suggested shareholders need to weigh that down instead.\n\nHe said that WorldCom agreed to pay fines \"because the company is in financial difficulty and it had to make some tough choices to save it\".\n\n\"Now we're in a position where we're having to face up to the fact that this is a serious criminal prosecution that if proved there could be serious criminal punishment.\"\n\nEbbers, who's being replaced as WorldCom's executive chairman by Mike Farris, said his company was still evaluating whether it will defend itself against criminal charges.\n\n\"At this point we are still reviewing that. We're not going to comment on anything that we have not reviewed and are not prepared to defend to court,\" he told Bloomberg TV.\n\nEbbers said that investors needed to understand his rationale for the settlement.\n\n\"I did not run the company when the problems took place.

    "Argentina has successfully closed a deal to swap $102.6bn in debt, a move that is aimed at averting a damaging default and bringing the South American nation one step closer to economic stability. \n\nThe Argentine government announced the deal on Monday, labeling it a significant moment in the country's efforts to tackle the long-standing issue of hit-or-miss payments on its external debt. Following months of negotiations with private creditors, the government confirmed that it had crossed the 90% acceptance mark needed to move forward with the swap deal.\n\nThe renegotiation of debt has been a cornerstone of President Alberto Fernández’s economic strategy since taking office in December. Seeking to avoid a ninth sovereign debt default, the administration had proposed an ambitious restructuring plan that invited bondholders to exchange their current holdings for new bonds that would pay less and mature later.\n\n\"This pact confirms the support and trust of our foreign investors and the international community,\" said Martin Guzman, Argentina's Economy Minister. \"It lifts a huge burden from our shoulders and charts a clear path towards economic recovery.\"\n\nArgentina's debt saga began in 2001 when it defaulted on nearly $100 billion, leading to years of legal battles with holdout creditors. Since then, the South American nation has been characterized by its precarious economy, underscored by rampant inflation, a fall in the currency, and dwindling foreign reserves.\n\nThe agreement is seen as remarkable in economic circles given that it was reached amid the global shock caused by the pandemic. Dire predictions of a prolonged debt standoff, which many expected would lead to a hard default and deepen the country's economic pain, have been avoided. \n\nInternational Monetary Fund's Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, applauded the agreement, stating that it will provide Argentina with substantial debt relief. “This is a very, very significant step forward,” Georgieva said. “Not just for Argentina but also contributing positively to the stability of the international financial system.”\n\nDespite this positive development, Argentina still faces daunting economic challenges on the horizon. The administration will now begin talks to renegotiate about $44 billion it borrowed from the International Monetary Fund in 2018, the largest loan package in the IMF's history.\n\nThis recent milestone marks a decisive resurrection for Argentina and sends out a strong signal to foreign investors that the country is willing to take serious steps to manage their financial situation. But the road to economic recovery remains long and steep, particularly under the shadow of the Coronavirus pandemic. The government will need to build upon this success with consistent fiscal policies that foster growth and investor confidence.",

    "\"Kong: Skull Island\" is a thrilling cinematic experience that breathes new life into the classic King Kong tale. The film is a visual spectacle, with stunning CGI that brings the mighty Kong and the terrifying creatures of Skull Island to life in a way that is both awe-inspiring and terrifying. \n\nThe film's narrative is well-paced, with a perfect blend of action, suspense, and character development. The story is set in the 1970s, which adds a unique flavor to the film, with a soundtrack that perfectly complements the era and the intense action sequences. \n\nThe ensemble cast, including Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, and Samuel L. Jackson, deliver strong performances. Each character is well-developed, with their own motivations and arcs that add depth to the film. John C. Reilly, in particular, provides some much-needed comic relief, and his performance is a standout.\n\nDirector Jordan Vogt-Roberts does an excellent job of balancing the film's various elements. The action sequences are intense and well-choreographed, and the quieter moments allow for character development and world-building. The film also does a great job of setting up the larger \"MonsterVerse,\" with references to other iconic monsters that will excite fans of the genre.\n\nHowever, the true star of the film is Kong himself. The CGI used to bring Kong to life is truly impressive, and the character is portrayed with a surprising amount of depth and emotion. Kong is not just a mindless beast, but a complex character with his own motivations and personality.\n\n\"Kong: Skull Island\" is not just a monster movie, but a film about survival, humanity, and the destructive power of war. It's a thrilling, visually stunning film that offers a fresh take on the King Kong mythos. Whether you're a fan of the original King Kong, or new to the story, \"Kong: Skull Island\" is a must-see.",

When I turn off the engine, the engine is dying, I don't get gas to the carb but once there is no gas then it starts and runs and the engine light turns on. Then the light goes out when the engine is running.\nDo I need to adjust something that is causing the problem?\nThere's a little brass ball in the top of the float carb, check to make sure theres gas in it. It takes gas out of the carb to help start your engine. I know when my carbs weren't working correctly, the brass balls were not getting gas, that caused a vacuum in the line that I didn't like in the first place. Might wanna try and pull that little ball off in the carb, get some carb cleaner into it and let it dry then put it back in and see if everything was all right, and if its not, try blowing through the carb line with air to test that the brass balls got fuel in them, then try it again without the air and see what happens.\nNot sure when you are talking about the light on the dash, but if its talking about the engine light, then you need to take it into a parts store like Auto zone, they can pull the code for you to read, no need to spend a ton of money at a mechanic to get a code read. You are able to hook a reader up yourself just ask for help, they do it for free.\nThe car does not have a dash engine light, not sure if they had those back then, but I imagine so.

    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I was at the RSD show in Paris last weekend and it's worth sharing with you all. The Grateful Dead played two shows there on July 31st and August 1st 1972. They were joined by Phil Lesh (who had just returned to the band after a long absence) for the first show and Bob Weir for the second. Both nights were sold out and the crowd was absolutely incredible. It was also the first time that the Dead played in France since their last tour back in 1973. This was the first time they ever played in Europe and the first time they played in France since 1971. The first night was a great one. The sound quality was excellent and the energy level was high. The music was tight and energetic and the audience was very enthusiastic. The second night was even better. The sound quality was much improved and the energy level was higher than the first night. The music was tighter and more focused and the audience was even more enthusiastic. The band sounded great and the crowd was really into it. There were some technical difficulties during the encore which caused the band to stop playing for about 10 minutes. After the break, the band came back out and played a few songs off of the new album. The crowd went wild again as the band started up the song \"Uncle John's Band\". The band then left the stage and the crowd cheered them on as they walked off stage. The show ended with an amazing rendition of \"Playing In The Band\". The entire concert was recorded and will be released on CD/DVD later this year. If you're interested in seeing what the Dead looked like live in France, check out the video below.

    "I've been thinking a lot about how difficult it can be to make friends as an adult. It seems like when we were kids, it was so much easier. You could just walk up to someone on the playground, ask if they wanted to play, and boom, you had a new friend. But as adults, it's not quite as simple.\n\nFirstly, we're all so busy. Between work, family, and other responsibilities, it can be hard to find the time to meet new people. And even when we do have the time, it can be difficult to know where to start. It's not like we can just walk up to someone at the grocery store and ask if they want to hang out.\n\nSecondly, there's the issue of compatibility. As adults, we have more defined personalities and interests. This can make it harder to find people we click with. And even when we do find someone we get along with, there's always the fear of rejection. What if they don't like us as much as we like them?\n\nDespite these challenges, I believe it's still possible to make friends as an adult. It might take more effort and intentionality, but it can be done. Here are a few strategies I've found helpful:\n\n1. Join a club or group: This can be a great way to meet people with similar interests. Whether it's a book club, a running group, or a hobby club, these types of groups provide a natural setting for friendships to form.\n\n2. Volunteer: Volunteering not only allows you to give back to your community, but it also puts you in contact with other caring individuals. These can be great foundations for friendships.\n\n3. Take a class: Whether it's a cooking class, a language class, or a fitness class, learning something new can be a great way to meet people.\n\n4. Be open: Sometimes, potential friends are already in our lives, but we're too focused on our own issues to notice. Try to be open to the people around you. You never know who might be feeling the same way you are.\n\n5. Be patient: Friendships take time to develop. Don't rush things. Let them develop naturally.\n\nI hope these tips are helpful. I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic. How have you made friends as an adult? What challenges have you faced? What strategies have you found helpful?",
    "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a cinematic masterpiece that beautifully encapsulates the life and career of the legendary Freddie Mercury and his band, Queen. The film is a rollercoaster of emotions, taking the audience on a journey through the highs and lows of Mercury's life, from his humble beginnings to his rise to stardom and his tragic death.\n\nRami Malek's portrayal of Freddie Mercury is nothing short of extraordinary. He embodies the flamboyant and charismatic persona of Mercury with such conviction that it's easy to forget you're watching an actor and not the rock icon himself. Malek's performance is a testament to his dedication and talent, and he truly deserves all the accolades he has received for this role.\n\nThe film's narrative is well-structured and engaging, providing a balanced mix of drama, humor, and heartbreak. The script is sharp and insightful, offering a nuanced portrayal of Mercury's complex personality and relationships. The film doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of Mercury's life, including his struggle with his sexuality and his battle with AIDS, which adds depth and authenticity to the story.\n\nThe music, of course, is a highlight of the film. The iconic Queen songs are woven seamlessly into the narrative, serving as a powerful backdrop to the unfolding drama. The Live Aid concert sequence is particularly impressive, recreating the electrifying atmosphere of the original event with stunning accuracy.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joe Mazzello, deliver strong performances, each bringing their respective characters to life with depth and nuance.

    "Thousands of people will be left without broadband access after BT announced it would stop providing fixed-line services in England and Wales by April 2017, leaving millions of households with no choice but to rely on mobile phone networks or pay for an internet connection through their mobile provider.\n\nBT said that its decision was based on the need to focus resources on improving its network and investing in new technologies such as 4G. The company also said that it had invested £1bn since 2010 in upgrading its network.\n\nBut critics have accused BT of making the move because it wants to make money from customers who are likely to switch to rival providers.\n\nIn a statement, BT said: \"We've made this decision because we want to invest more in our network and deliver better value for all our customers.\"\n\nIt added: \"Our investment programme has been driven by customer demand and we're committed to delivering the best possible service for them.\"\n\nHowever, the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones says that many people will not be able to afford to buy a new smartphone if they lose their home broadband connection.\n\nHe told Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics: \"I think there's going to be a lot of people who won't be able to get a new handset because they can't afford to upgrade their phones.\n\n\"They'll just go back to using their old one which means they'll still be paying BT for the same service.\"",
    "## Feature Based Fuzzy Rule Base Design for Image Extraction\nA. Bharti and B.B. Aggrawal Dept. of Electrical Engg., IIT Kanpur, Kanpur - 208016, India\n\nWith the increased emphasis on computational power and memory, modern pattern recognition schemes demand huge processing time and high memory requirements. Moreover, in many situations there is a need to devise a computer vision system that can operate in a distributed fashion. Our goal is to design a pattern recognition system that can be applied to a variety of situations, and can be realized with minimal requirements. We present experimental demonstration of the efficacy of a parallel architecture for recognition of geometric patterns. We show that even with distributed processing a pattern can be recognized correctly. We present a parallel architecture based on a set of fuzzy rule bases derived from the recognition features rather than from the pattern themselves. In this way recognition features of each pattern are represented in terms of fuzzy sets, which are then incorporated into a set of fuzzy rule bases to realize the classification strategy and recognize the patterns. To avoid the need to specify fuzzy membership functions, a data structure called the Fuzzy Rule Base is employed where the features are fuzzy subsets and the rules represent fuzzy relations. Using the fuzzy rule base, no fuzzy membership functions need to be specified, and the rules can be determined directly from training data. Therefore, the system is adaptive and can be changed on the fly. The features and the rules are determined using the fuzzy clustering and the fuzzy clustering based rule algorithm. The system is capable of detecting features independently and performing recognition, eliminating the need for parallel processing. The system is capable of detecting non-overlapping rectangular objects from their features rather than from their boundaries. We have demonstrated an architecture capable of performing pattern recognition using this approach. We have shown that it can successfully be reconfigured and changed for application to new tasks. This allows for the realization of an adaptive visual system where learning is continuous and knowledge is built into the system.\n\n## Design of Fuzzy Rule Interface Module\nA detailed module design using the information collected earlier is given as follows:\n\nThe fuzzy rule interface module design is shown in figure 3. As suggested in figure 3 above, the module is subdivided into two sub-modules:\n\n  -\tThe Fuzzy Feature Extraction Module: \n  \n    \tThis",
    "I had been dating this guy for a little over a year (we're 22), it started off really well. We were texting everyday and he would make plans to come hangout with me but it seemed the more we dated the less he cared, but i had given up on him. We were supposed to hangout the next morning, i had been waiting for hours, and i started getting more and more worried. He didn't text to tell me how long it would take for him to get here or if he was still coming so i just told him i was going home, he texted me 5 hours later saying he would come visit me the next day but he cancelled (he was going to stay with his girlfriend who lived 30 min. away and he didn't want to be late/sleep on my couch). The next week he cancelled plans and i got so mad about it that i cut off ties with him, i ignored him for almost 2 weeks and this past weekend he texted saying we should hangout so i agreed to lunch on monday.\n\nHe says how nice it was to see me, that it'd been too long and how he missed me and missed talking to me, he says he would drive to my work the next day, i tell him that i would be working at a different store and my shift is the same and he says don't worry he'll just wait for me to get off. He sends me a text message that says he's at the store now. I check the time of the message, its been 1 and a half hours since the original message with out a single update as to where he is, i ask why he never updated me, he replied saying that he didn't know how to message from his phone. My manager texts me asking if i can clock out early because my shift was over and he was there, so i text him and say that now that i was able to work with my schedules time change and leave early i would wait for him. After some of the longest 10-15 mins of my life he texts me saying that he lost my number (even though we text everyday for the past 6 months) and that he could see my work from the parking lot and he was going to try and find what store i was at. I ask him why he didn't ask the cashier since they know me and",

    "\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", the fifth instalment in the Harry Potter Series, truly holds its ground and carries forward the legacy of the globally acclaimed franchise. Director David Yates has managed to deliver a visually stunning piece, filled with an assortment of emotions, ranging from elation to a deep sense of loss. \n\nIn terms of acting, the young ensemble once again shines with a notable increase in the depth of their performances. Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry Potter, brilliantly displays his character's maturing, showing signs of the weary hero facing increasing burdens. Furthermore, Imelda Staunton's Dolores Umbridge stands out as an impactful antagonist, ingrained in our memories with her zeal for wickedness concealed under a façade of polished politeness. \n\nThe special effects in \"Order of the Phoenix\" are enchanting, staying true to the fantasy genre with its magnificent CGI. From the Thestrals to the riveting wizard duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, the visual effects add significantly to the magic and grandeur of the film. \n\nThe narrative gets darker, reflecting the rising threats and emotional turmoil faced by our lead characters. The script beautifully intertwines the central theme about the importance of hopeful defiance in the face of impending doom. The battles are not just with external forces, but also within, and this film does justice in portraying that struggle.\n\nIf there is one critique to be made, it would be that the movie often rushes through important plot points, perhaps due to the constraint of fitting a large amount of content from J.K. Rowling's fifth book into a two hour film. That being said, the essence of the story is not lost and freshness is maintained despite being a part of a long series.\n\nBeyond its grandeur and impeccable performances, the film stands tall as a piece of art that brings about the right emotions at the right time, giving one a rich, satisfying cinematic experience. It symbolises the bravery and resilience of adolescents faced with a changing world. A truly engaging watch for audiences of all ages, this movie is a wonderful blend of magic, conflict, friendships, and a subtle reminder of the inevitability of growing up.",
    "\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\" is based on a book by Jon Ronson, which I've never read, nor do I intend to. I was drawn to go see it because it is supposedly based on real events and I wanted to see if they would \"change\" any details of the story in order to make the movie more palatable to the public. If you have never heard of it, it is a great idea, or at least a good idea, but it is NOT as good as it sounds. The movie, which was adapted by the screenwriter behind \"The Big Lebowski\" and \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" and directed by actor-turned-director Grant Heslov (who is best know for his role as Agent Tom Reese in \"The Hunt for Red October\" and in 2004, he was the Democratic Party's delegate in charge of organizing and planning the Democratic National Convention in Boston) and scripted by the screenwriter behind \"A Serious Man,\" Peter Straughan and \"Dusk,\" Andrew Niccol, I'll tell you right now: despite the big names involved, the movie is a disappointment and a let down. And while it is interesting to some degree, it never manages to rise beyond the novelty and the \"outrageous.\"\nThe story itself centers on a reporter, who, in an attempt to write new and different articles, ventures into the world of special forces to see if they have any interesting secret projects. He finds that they do: the military has been involved with an occult group called the \"The New World Order\" which has been trying to develop psychic and paranormal abilities in some of the military's special forces personnel. That is the point where the movie is at its most original. Unfortunately, after that, it gets bogged down in long boring talking-head scenes in front of a committee asking questions about whether or not these \"Special Forces\" actually exist or are actually worth the cost of development. There is nothing particularly funny (or interesting) about this movie. You are not laughing. You are not gasping for breath in excitement. All you are doing was watching a boring-looking movie, which, at its most exciting is just going to annoy you because it is making fun of religion (the fact that the government has invested much money and time into finding God, but that those",

    "Hi everyone,\n\nA few days ago, I tried marijuana for the very first time with some friends. I had never tried it before, and since we were at a party and everyone was doing it, I thought 'why not?' I felt okay initially, nothing much different from what I expected. But an hour in, things began to change on an intense level.\n\nMy heart began to race, my vision blurred and I became extremely paranoid. I thought the walls were closing in on me and I truly believed that everyone at the party was out to kill me. It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. I wasn't just high - I wasn't just paranoid. I was straight-up hallucinating. Everything was very intense and scary.\n\nI'm honestly clueless about this, since I don't have much experience with marijuana. But is it normal to hallucinate and feel this paranoid? Could it have been laced with something else, maybe? One of my friends did tell me that sometimes stuff he buys can be laced with other drugs but I shrugged it off, thinking he was just messing with me.\n\nIf anything similar has happened to you, I'd appreciate it if you could give me some insight. Does it always feel this way the first time? Did I just panic because I was not used to it? Maybe I just took too much? I probably won't be touching it again anytime soon, but I just want to understand what happened.\n\nThanks in advance. Just trying to make sense of this whole experience.",
    "As an ardent fan of Johnny Test, this news comes as a gut punch to me. I had a strong connection to the Test family, where Johnny Test, the 11-year-old headstrong boy who became my childhood hero, was breaking the monotony of a commoner's life with his super genius twin sisters. The way Johnny used his sisters' inventions to live his adventurously relatable life was the highlight of many of my after school evenings.\n\nNow, hearing about the reboot of Johnny Test is giving me mixed feelings. On one hand, like every nostalgic millennial, I'd love to relive my childhood memories. On the other hand, I'm scared that the original essence of the show may get lost in the transition to 2021.\n\nPersonally, reboots have always been a cause for concern for me. There've been numerous instances where the reboots have failed to capture the magic of the original series and ended up ruining the franchise instead. These new reboots often change character dynamics, art style, and most importantly, the root of the show that connected with audiences in the first place.\n\nThe sudden influx of reboots is also a bit depressing, as it makes me feel like the industry is running out of fresh ideas and is heavily leaning on the nostalgia factor to sell their shows, often forgoing quality and storytelling in the process. I want to be proven wrong though and I hope Johnny Test's reboot does justice to the original.\n\nI haven't heard much about how the show plans to maintain the original elements that stole our hearts in the first place, such as Dukey's friendship and the girls' scientific experiments going haywire. Is it too much to ask that they keep the essence of the original while adding new plots and twists?\n\nAll in all, as an avid Johnny Test fan, this reboot comes with excitement but also a certain level of trepidation. Only time will tell if it'll do justice to the original or end up as another stark example of a \"ruined\" reboot. I’m cautiously optimistic and hope they manage to preserve the heart and soul of Johnny Test while navigating it through the modern era.",

    "The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has unequivocally denied recent rumours that the classic British sitcom, 'Blackadder', is set for a television comeback.\n\nSpeculation has been rife within the industry and among dedicated fans of the show since actor Sir Tony Robinson, who portrayed the character Baldrick in the historical comedy, suggested a new series could be on the horizon during an interview last week. However, the BBC insists there are no plans to revive the iconic series.\n\nIn a brief statement, a BBC spokesperson said, \"Whilst we love the unforgettable sitcom, Blackadder, as much as our audiences do, we have no current plans to bring the show back for a fifth series.\"\n\nBlackadder was a staple of British television and gained a considerable global following from the early '80s to the late '90s. The series centred on the ill-fated antics of the scheming Edmund Blackadder, played by Rowan Atkinson, across various historical periods. It also saw performances from a host of celebrated British actors, including Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Miranda Richardson and Rik Mayall.\n\nThe show was widely popular for its clever puns and sarcastic humour intelligently woven into historical contexts. The last series, 'Blackadder Goes Forth', which depicted the trench warfare of the First World War, concluded poignantly on a sombre note, with its main characters going \"over the top\" into No Man's Land.\n\nThe refusal to confirm a reboot comes amidst a trend of popular shows such as 'Friends', 'Frasier' and 'The Office' either returning or being rebooted for nostalgic fans.\n\nReacting to this refusal, some fans expressed their disappointment on social media, with many stating that they had been looking forward to the potential return of the cunning Blackadder and his hilariously dim-witted sidekick, Baldrick. Others, however, agreed with the BBC's decision, fearing that a revival could tarnish the original show's perfect ending.\n\nFor now, it seems fans of the quick-witted Edmund Blackadder will need to satisfy their cravings with reruns of the original four series and occasional Christmas specials, available on streaming services.",

    "Paula Radcliffe, the world-renowned British long-distance runner, has once again silenced her critics with an impressive performance at the latest international marathon event. \n\nRadcliffe, who has been plagued by injuries and doubts over her form in recent years, finished the gruelling 26.2-mile race in a time that was not only a personal best but also placed her among the top finishers. \n\nThe 47-year-old athlete, who holds the women's world record for the fastest marathon time, has faced a barrage of criticism in recent years. Critics have questioned her ability to compete at the highest level, citing her age and injury history as potential hindrances. \n\nHowever, Radcliffe's latest performance has proven that she is far from finished. Her time, which she achieved despite challenging weather conditions, was faster than many of her younger competitors. \n\nSpeaking after the race, Radcliffe said, \"I've always said that age is just a number. I know what I'm capable of and I've never let the doubters get to me. Today was about proving to myself that I can still compete with the best.\"\n\nHer coach, Gary Lough, echoed her sentiments, stating, \"Paula has always been a fighter. She's had to overcome a lot of obstacles in her career, but she's never let that stop her. Today's performance is a testament to her determination and resilience.\"\n\nRadcliffe's performance has been hailed as an inspiration by fellow athletes and fans alike. Many have taken to social media to congratulate her, with some suggesting that her achievement could pave the way for older athletes in the sport.\n\nThe British runner's triumphant return to form has certainly silenced her critics, at least for now. It remains to be seen whether Radcliffe will continue to compete at this level, but one thing is clear: she has once again proven that she is a force to be reckoned with in the world of long-distance running.",
    "A new plan calling on the government to pay for a massive injection of cash into social care, including tens of billions extra over four years, was given its best chance on Wednesday when former health secretary Andrew Lansley unveiled his proposal before an audience of senior Tory MPs who had demanded he put down his pencil and follow up. The draft document which will form part of the coalition's forthcoming autumn statement will see the introduction of universal access to community medical centres (CMCs), as well as free personalised prescriptions at GPs' surgeries. In other moves, those aged 60 and above would be able to opt out of paying GP prescription charges from 2014. And the current system of funding care – provided by local councils based around clinical need rather than demand – could change under the proposals. A detailed set of recommendations on how to make life easier for people with limited or no money to buy medicines for themselves were presented in an 11-page white paper. Mr Lansley's group is considering including measures that will help hard-pressed patients, such as ensuring they get subsidised prescriptions so they can continue taking their medication without fear of a bill for it. Other areas being looked at include the creation of dedicated beds for children and disabled adults, free eye tests to prevent blindness, the provision of community care resources and information services and increased income tax concessions for some parts of society, such as older people. One Tory MP said Mr Lansley should have introduced the ideas sooner, but they wanted details about what sort of extra investment might ultimately fall across. He praised one proposed idea - called the Personal Healthcare Tax Offset (PHOTO) which will encourage households with incomes below £10,420 per year to purchase private medicine and use a special discount rate when picking it up. It has been floated by Liberal Democrat Vince Cable a month ago. But David Willetts yesterday rejected suggestions of such schemes and insisted there is plenty more to come next year. 'Nonsense': Tory MP Philip Davies told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he did not believe the PHOTO concept made sense \"At a time that we all share the view that we're struggling to deal with this issue comprehensively then it looks like nonsense,\" Mr Willetts added.",

The main idea behind this approach consists on using statistical mechanics tools like entropy maximization principles or thermodynamic potentials that are defined by means other than standard Legendre transformations; these alternative definitions allow us not only recover known results but also obtain new ones related with non-equilibrium thermodynamics concepts which have been recently developed within relativistic hydrodynamics literature [1]. In particular we show how one can derive some well established relations between transport coefficients appearing at different orders when expanding around equilibrium states through our framework without resorting any kind expansion procedure whatsoever - just starting directly off assuming certain symmetries satisfied locally near each point where they hold true simultaneously everywhere else too! This way it becomes possible even though there might be no explicit dependence upon time variables involved anywhere inside them either because everything happens instantaneously due solely their own intrinsic properties alone rather being driven externally via external forces acting outside themselves instead.\"",
    "I have been taking Concerta for about 2 years now and I am very happy with my experience so far. The only thing that bothers me is that I get headaches when I take it, but I don't know if this is just because I'm sensitive to it or something else. It's not like I can't function normally without it though. I've had no problems sleeping at night either. I also noticed that I feel more energetic after taking it, which makes sense since it helps me sleep better. I haven't experienced any other side effects yet, but I will be keeping an eye out for them.\n\nSo what do you think? Is there anything in Concerta that could cause headaches?",
    "In his first speech since winning re-election, Gordon Brown has outlined plans for further reform in education and health care as well setting out an ambitious agenda to tackle climate change at home while helping developing countries adapt too....... The prime minister said he wanted Britain's schools system - which was already one that produced some excellent results but also had many failing institutions –to be transformed into something even better...... He promised more money would go towards improving teaching standards by recruiting top graduates who could become teachers..... Mr Blair set up academies where heads were given greater freedom over their budgets with less interference than traditional state run secondary school systems..........Mr Cameron wants all new primary headteachers appointed on merit rather then political patronage or connections………He will announce today how Labour intends tackling global warming through measures such reducing carbon emissions…..Labour says it can do this without increasing taxes….It claims its policies are fairer because they spread costs across society not just those earning above £10k per year………… It aims instead raise revenue via green levys including taxing flights leaving UK airspace …and introducing charges based upon vehicle size when driving around town centres................ In addition there should have been no mention whatsoever about any future government raising income levels (taxes) beyond what we currently pay now! This means if you're making $50K/year right here within America; chances likely exist your salary won't increase much higher unless inflation rates rise significantly during next four years under Obama administration due largely increased spending programs being implemented throughout Washington DC area alone--which isn’t good sign either way considering current economic conditions worldwide especially Europe regionally speaking.",

    "Oleg Deripaska, convicted ex-KGB spy who survived a botched US attempt to have him extradited by Vladimir Putin's Russia last year, has claimed that his former colleagues secretly brought down oil giant Rosneft and Russian state gas firm Gazprom at the same time by giving \"a signal\". The suggestion is now being aired openly at a conference devoted to \"the new reality of international energy\".\n\nDeripaska said he believed the \"signal\" was something akin to the BP and Halliburton contracts which saw huge payments made towards buying out rival companies amid the 2008 financial crisis while also putting pressure on rival states for energy supplies.\n\n\nHe revealed what his sources told him about how that money flowed through a network to bring down both entities. The Russian-German businessman described the process as a massive conspiracy by \"well-financed\" groups within the Russian government, banks and energy sector in partnership with western countries. He provided no details or evidence as to where these sources might be found.\n\nThe timing of the claims and the fact that they appear to have been confirmed before Deripaska appears again is interesting – Deripaska appeared to have just come off television to give an interview suggesting he may not survive another trial for alleged tax frauds…\n\nRelated articles",

    "Arsene Wenger, the renowned former coach of Arsenal FC, is set to return to the soccer world with a substantial summer budget to boot. \n\nIn what is certain to energize enthusiasts of the beautiful game, football insiders hint that Wenger has been given a formidable \"war chest\" for the summer. The exact amount remains shrouded in secrecy, although the figure is speculated to be sizable enough to make significant investments in fresh talent.\n\nDuring his 22-year tenure at Arsenal, Wenger was celebrated for his ability to identify and nurture young talents, turning them into world-class players. The return of such a colossal figure to active football with a significant budget to upgrade a team will undoubtedly set tongues wagging about potential transfer targets.\n\nWenger, a master tactician, has been on a self-imposed sabbatical from the game since stepping down from the helm at Arsenal in 2018. His return with a substantial financial backing has sparked wild speculation on his next move. \n\nAlthough the club Wenger will be working with continues to be a closely-guarded secret, insiders suggest it could be one in need of substantial rebuilding. With his uncanny ability to transform lesser-known players into footballing powerhouses, it will be interesting to see who Wenger brings into the fold. \n\nThe Frenchman’s approach to team building, alongside his massive war chest, could lead to a shift in power in world football. Wenger’s pedigree and apparent funds have instantly put top clubs on notice.\n\nWhen we consider Wenger's history, it's not unreasonable to expect thrilling transfers. Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil, and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were all high-profile signings brought in under his watch at Arsenal.\n\nWhile the announcement brings about excitement, it also revives noted criticism of Wenger's polarizing tenure at Arsenal. Critics accused him of being overly frugal and failing to deliver Premier League titles consistently.\n\nNonetheless, Wenger's potential return to football management, equipped with a loaded war chest, is a thrilling prospect for any football fan. One can only wait in anticipation to see what surprises Wenger has in store for the summer transfer window.\n\nFew can argue that Wenger's return to the sport, coupled with a significant budget, will add much-needed spice to the forthcoming summer activities. Whether he sinks or swims in these turbulent football waters, it is safe to say that the Wenger effect is back.",

    "This paper explores the utilization of contrastive learning for medical image segmentation, particularly in cases where only limited annotations are available. The focus is on the simultaneous extraction of both global and local features from the images. The corresponding method employed, referred to as 'dual-branch network', is designed to recognize and learn the inherent variation between anatomical structures present in the images, whilst overcoming the challenges of limited data with high quality labels. Intrinsic to this method is a contrastive loss function that enhances the distinction of inter-class variations and intraclass similarities. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art segmentation methods. The findings of this study could have significant implications for the future of medical imaging, by improving segmentation accuracy and functionality in clinical settings.",

    "IMDb.com Rating: 3.6/10\n\nChicken Run is not only an interesting movie, but it also has amazing performances by some of the stars of the hit TV show \"The Wire\". For starters, Dominic West and Jimmy Smits play Jamal and Darya and do an amazing job at portraying these characters and acting in a believable way. This movie had a lot of character development and had some intense scenes. It's quite amusing to see both characters at their finest and the worst they do. Of course, the characters were created on screen and not in the writers room, it takes someone with a lot of energy to create such strong performers. On top of that, the plot was also rather complicated; in addition to the storyline of Chicken Run, the writers also had to keep track of the many storylines going into place with all other shows (The Wire, Dexter, Deadwood, The Shield etc.). While the plot twists were a bit excessive, they are also well written at times and some of them were pretty awesome. After the ending credits, you will still feel the same emotion as you did from the beginning of the movie.\n\nIn terms of artistry, the film is good. This can also be seen when the scenes with Freddie Prinze. There are scenes that were breathtaking to view, like when a couple is getting married, or when a dog and man are getting into a bar fight. It's also worth noting that the art style of the movie is really good, which is quite rare to see nowadays.\n\nOverall, there are a lot of movies for those people who like movies with good directing, actors, sound and screenplay. Chicken Run is a movie that you just have to watch. I highly recommend this movie because there is so much good stuff, you will be entertained even in the longest of scenes.\n\nClick HERE to see the full review of Chicken Run from IMDb.com.",
    "Now that there have been no confirmed reports of Ebola cases in the United States, and after I wrote up my own thoughts about why someone might wish to get the plague while in Dallas/Fort Worth I haven¹t heard anything much else about it on there–no links in posts (perhaps they're waiting for more information?), or comments (maybe it's so you can't reply?). So it looks like I'm going to let this one go, unless I run into another outbreak (or if everyone in my city decides to start killing themselves).\n\nYou might be asking yourself, how did the original poster end up writing this? According to an article, posted by The Telegraph in 2013 before the current outbreak of the disease, the CDC advised doctors not to give anyone with non-neurological problems (including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis) antimalarial drugs because the drugs are \"unproven against Ebola virus.\" This is despite their knowing the virus was emerging in West Africa earlier this year, as documented here. A spokesperson at the American Association of Clinical Immunology wrote to CNN that \"there will always be some risk but the probability of getting infected through any medication remains extremely low,\" because these medicines don'¿ t cure any diseases like Ebola does. However, despite admitting there was a small chance of contracting the disease through treatment, the hospital told me their patients were allowed to stay home and continue their routine, even when the doctors had reason to think otherwise! A further problem for some people who are already weakened by medical treatments is malaria — though it kills far more people than Ebola. People living where a country has a large number of people treated with antimalarials, including for cancer (like Dr Lancer) get infected disproportionately due to this, which we've pointed out. In Uganda recently, some hospitals began admitting cancer patients who weren't suffering from severe illness and instead treating them like criminals awaiting execution due to lack of access to health care, leaving many people without access to chemotherapy drugs needed for their pain relief. If you're unfamiliar with HIV, malaria, AIDS, TB, etc., Ebola isn't exactly pleasant news for you either — nor are those sorts of infections particularly common anywhere else on earth.\n\nIn fact, there aren't very many other options to treat Ebola besides anti-malarials; all forms of medicine are not known to work against",
    "This paper presents a comprehensive approach to non-adaptive group testing on graphs, a classical combinatorial problem with various applications, notably in bioinformatics and social network analysis. It investigates the problem of determining a small subset of vertices in a graph using a minimal number of group tests when the probability of vertex failures is known, under the non-adaptive constraint. For this model, several graph classes and algorithmic strategies are examined. Experimentally, the proposed algorithms are evaluated concerning efficiency and reliability. The paper contributes to expanding the understanding of group testing on graphs, providing practical implications for complex system monitoring, network fault diagnosis, and disease outbreak detection. The results may also be leveraged to devise more effective group testing strategies in real-world networks.",
    "So I just moved into this house in Oakland about four months ago. My boyfriend and I think the house is haunted. Nothing extreme or even that noticeable like ghosts appearing or strange noises, but our cats freaked out a few times and it feels like there is some presence here.\nAs a creative person, I wanted to make ambient music I could play in the house 24/7 to just mellow out and ease the tension. I've listened to dozens of ghost box recordings while looking for inspiration, and it sounds like there is something here. I'm not a musician nor do I have the equipment to even make most of the sound effects heard in a ghost box, so I was hoping to have some of you more experienced in that field give me some advice.\nI would really love to capture some voices to make a haunting track. My recording equipment is super simple: my laptop has a built in microphone that I use with Audacity. I know ghosts voices are generally deep and scratchy sounding, so I've always used Audacity to alter the pitch to make it sound more otherworldly. I've used filters and other effects to make it sound like an echo and then altered the time duration. I am open to any and all suggestions!

    "\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" is an extraordinarily insightful coming-of-age film that presents a poignant exploration of adolescence. The brilliant screenplay, based on Stephen Chbosky's bestselling novel, beautifully expresses the trials of growing up, mental health, love, and friendship.\n\nThe movie remarkably captures the high school experience with a balance of poignancy and humor, something many attempts at such films fail to achieve. The vivid cinematic style and authentic dialogue are absolutely captivating. One walks away from this movie truly understanding and sympathizing with the complexity of the characters.\n\nLogan Lerman's sensitive and sincere portrayal of the protagonist, Charlie, is nothing short of exceptional. He perfectly captures the sensitivity, imagination, and quiet strength of his character. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller also give moving performances as the supportive and dynamic friends who help Charlie navigate his high school years. The brilliant performances by these actors truly breathe life to their complex roles, making their experiences and emotions deeply resonate with audiences.\n\nThe film's ending is particularly stirring, creating a rollercoaster of emotions that will leave you thinking and processing for days. The thought-provoking themes regarding mental health and trauma are portrayed tactfully and honestly, and it’s this raw emotional honesty that sets the movie apart.\n\nThe soundtrack of the movie deserves a special mention. It notably enhances the storytelling, with every song seeming to fit flawlessly with each frame, every sequence. Indie-rock anthems mixed with classic tunes take you down the memory lane, enhancing the nostalgic sense this movie emanates.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" is much more than your regular teen flick. It's a triumph of skillful storytelling, superb acting, and powerful direction that tackles a complex narrative. Whether you're a teenager or simply young at heart, this film will touch you, make you think, and speak to your soul in ways very few films can. Truly, a must-watch movie.",

    "Hi, I'm a woman who works at a tech company and I've been working there for about 2 years now. I have a lot of friends here but I feel like I can never really be myself around them because they're all so different than me. I know that's not true, but it feels like it sometimes. I think part of this stems from how much work we do to try to fit into these groups. We spend hours on end trying to make ourselves look good by being nice or funny or whatever. It's exhausting and it makes us uncomfortable. I also think that some people just aren't comfortable with women in general. They see us as competition, which is why they tend to treat us differently.

    "I'm not sure if I've ever seen anything quite like this before, and it's hard to put into words what exactly makes this film so special. It's an incredibly well-crafted piece of work that manages to be both funny and heartwarming at the same time. The story follows two actors who are trying to make their way in Hollywood by acting as fake friends with famous people. They're successful enough to get some small roles on TV shows, but they still have no idea how to act or what to say when they meet someone new. When one of them gets fired from his job, he decides to take a chance and try out for a major role. He doesn't know anyone in the industry, but he has a great audition and gets the part. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned. His character ends up getting killed off during filming, which leads him to realize that he needs to learn more about acting. This leads him to start working on his own projects, which eventually lead to him being cast in a big budget movie.\n\nThis movie is very much a comedy, but there are also moments where you can see the tragedy behind the humor. There are times when you feel sorry for these characters because they're struggling to find themselves and their place in life. And then there are other times where you laugh at how ridiculous they look. But all of those moments are balanced perfectly by the fact that the movie never takes itself too seriously. You'll always laugh at something that happens in the movie, even if it's just a joke.\n\nThere are many different scenes throughout the movie that will leave you laughing your ass off. Some of my favorites include the scene where the actor playing the dead guy tries to convince the real actor to come back to life, the scene where the actor pretending to be a friend of the dead guy tells the real actor that he should kill himself, and the scene where the actor pretending to be a friend of the dead guy asks the real actor why he didn't tell him about the death. All of these scenes were hilarious and made me want to watch the rest of the movie over and over again.\n\nOverall, \"The Disaster Artist\" was a fun ride that left me wanting to see more. If you haven't already watched it, do yourself a favor and check it out!",

    "This film is about Detroit, Michigan and its people. It's not just about the city itself but also the people who live there. The story follows two young men as they try to make it in this tough world. They are both struggling musicians trying to get by on their own. One of them has an older brother that he needs to support financially while the other one is trying to find his way through life. This film is very much about the struggles of being a musician in America today. I think that this film will be interesting to watch because it shows how hard it can be to survive in this country. There are many things that you have to deal with when you're living in a big city like Detroit. You have to work hard to make ends meet and you have to keep your head up and stay positive. These guys do all these things and then they end up getting into some trouble.\n\nI really enjoyed watching this movie. It was well made and had great performances. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something different than what we usually see in movies.",
    "As someone new to the concept of an open relationship, I’m finding it a challenging landscape to navigate. My partner suggested the idea and instead of outright rejecting it, I've decided to explore the way this relationship model can fit into our lives. Any helpful advice would be much appreciated. \n\nIt’s important for me to note that there is no lack of spark or love in our relationship. We’ve spent a beautiful time together over the years, and there's always been honesty and respect. \n\nMy partner and I communicated openly about this potential change. They assured me that their wish for an open relationship doesn't signify the desire to end our relationship, but rather to explore their feelings and desires – a notion which calms but also scares me. I have agreed to think about and research this lifestyle more thoroughly, thus this Reddit post.\n\nIf any of you have experienced open relationships - either positive or negative, could you share your perspectives, possibly also including advice about communication, ground rules, dealing with feelings of jealousy, uncertainty or insecurity?\n\nSpecifically, how do you establish and respect boundaries in an open relationship? How do you balance spending quality time with your primary partner while also respecting the other relationships or connections? \n\nMost importantly, how can you ensure you're not losing that exclusive bond with your partner once you decide to explore connections outside your relationship? \n\nAlso, if there are recommended books, podcasts, or other resources on open relationships, feel free to drop them below.\n\nIn the end, I want to make a decision that not only respects my partner's desires but also ensures my feelings and emotions are protected and valued.\n\nThank you in advance for your respectful and helpful responses.",

    "We demonstrate remote quantum transmission at room temperature and high precision through polarization polarization switching, providing unprecedented capability to transfer large quantities of information in the near future by using a single photon as channel. At room temperature the photon carries out four polarization state transitions. By integrating our results into an accurate classical encoding scheme we have managed to achieve nonlinear optical communication with up to 1 Gbit/s speed on standard silicon substrates with a bandwidth-limited number of channels (i10 = 10^2). In this way, data can be transmitted without loss or errors over distances exceeding several kcm. We address other challenges such as high quality interconnects, energy management and efficient use of laser power. The proposed algorithms are designed together with the requirements of commercial applications where real-time quantum communications is paramount. Finally, thanks to robust integration of experimental measurements with theoretical calculations we were able to develop new constraints which further improve our theoretical predictions.",
    "Now, it really doesn't need to be said that it's a bit of a miracle that we have a world where something like this didn't occur.

    "\"Captain Marvel\" is a thrilling addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that introduces audiences to a new superhero with a unique origin story. Brie Larson delivers a powerful performance as Carol Danvers, a former U.S. Air Force pilot who becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes. Larson's portrayal of Danvers is both fierce and vulnerable, adding depth to the character and making her relatable to the audience.\n\nThe film's plot is engaging and well-paced, with a perfect blend of action, humor, and emotional moments. The narrative cleverly intertwines elements of the larger Marvel universe, while also standing on its own as a compelling story about self-discovery and empowerment. The 90s setting adds a nostalgic touch, and the film's soundtrack is a delightful mix of 90s hits that perfectly complements the action on screen.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Samuel L. Jackson as a younger Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn as the Skrull leader Talos, also deliver strong performances. The chemistry between Larson and Jackson is particularly enjoyable to watch, and their banter provides some of the film's most memorable moments.\n\nThe visual effects in \"Captain Marvel\" are stunning, with epic space battles and impressive displays of Captain Marvel's powers. The de-aging technology used on Jackson and Clark Gregg (who plays Agent Coulson) is also remarkably convincing.\n\nWhile \"Captain Marvel\" does follow some familiar superhero movie tropes, it also subverts expectations in interesting ways, particularly in its depiction of the Skrulls. The film's feminist themes are also well-handled, never feeling forced or preachy.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Captain Marvel\" is a fun, empowering, and visually stunning superhero film that adds an exciting new chapter to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a must-watch for Marvel fans and a great introduction to the character for those unfamiliar with her.",
    "BEREA, Ohio -- Browns coach Pat Shurmur on Wednesday again suggested that he was unaware that defensive end Ray McDonald spent most of his time in jail two years ago for assaulting then-girlfriend and now ex-fiancée Evanger Taylor. But another player made no such suggestion, telling cleveland.com that he didn't know if McDonald had been convicted or acquitted, saying it would be an interesting case because of the circumstances leading to its acquittal. A former NFL player who said he wasn't ready to comment publicly about the matter last week, linebacker Karlos Dansby acknowledged McDonald spent some amount of time getting help but also expressed concern about potential repercussions down the road as well. Both players have called attention elsewhere in the media to their ongoing disputes with certain teammates and those around them.... McDonald ended up being given probation but not jail time by County Court Judge James Pohl. That sentence began to expire several months after the charges were filed when local authorities found they hadn't provided the probation officer his correct number, according to court clerk Karen Clark. The woman in this situation is likely much more sympathetic than Shurmur might think -- she's probably one of the few people who actually understands the effects of domestic violence better than him. While there is no legal procedure that prevents an employer from asking whether someone has violated a specific condition or whether something that happened within the last 10 years should count toward a conviction, anyone who has been threatened or abused doesn't deserve any benefits at all, let alone sympathy from any company that takes advantage of their good nature. So let me say exactly what I want Shurmur's listeners to hear... In May of 2013, McDonald punched, choked and kicked Eviction Taylor so badly she suffered three broken ribs. This led her to sue McDonald, Taylor and others involved for assault, battery, infliction of emotional anguish, intentional infliction of emotional distress and stalking. In her lawsuit (which was settled out of court), Taylor alleged she repeatedly tried to get out of McDonald's apartment when the latter wouldn't allow it, which got increasingly uncomfortable with McDonald's behavior. Her suit charged that McDonald broke both her hands trying to hold onto his arm, threw beer bottles at her face or into the sink when she attempted to leave the apartment and attacked and choked her during a confrontation after he refused to pay for their child care the day her mother discovered he'd cheated on her",

    "The UK film industry has experienced a significant decline in production, with a 40% drop reported in 2021, according to the British Film Institute (BFI). This sharp decrease is largely attributed to the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has disrupted filming schedules and led to the closure of cinemas nationwide.\n\nThe BFI's annual report revealed that only 188 films went into production in the UK last year, compared to 314 in 2020, marking the lowest number since records began. The total spend on film production also fell by 21% to £1.3bn, down from £1.6bn in 2020.\n\nThe pandemic has had a profound impact on the film industry, with social distancing measures and lockdowns forcing many productions to halt or delay filming. The closure of cinemas has also led to a significant loss of revenue, with many films being released directly to streaming platforms instead.\n\nDespite the challenges, the BFI report highlighted some positive trends. High-end television production, which includes shows made for streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon, increased by 11% to a record £2.3bn. This suggests a shift in consumer behaviour, with more people choosing to watch content at home rather than in cinemas.\n\nThe report also noted that the UK film industry is showing signs of recovery. The number of films going into production in the second half of 2021 was almost double that of the first half, indicating that the industry is beginning to adapt to the new challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nBen Roberts, CEO of the BFI, said: \"Despite the significant challenges of the past year, the resilience and creativity of the UK film industry have been truly remarkable. We are optimistic about the future and believe that with the right support, the industry can bounce back stronger than ever.\"\n\nThe UK government has introduced a £500m film and TV production restart scheme to help the industry recover. The scheme provides compensation for productions that have been halted or delayed due to Covid-19.\n\nHowever, industry experts warn that the recovery will be slow and uneven, with many smaller production companies struggling to survive. They are calling for more government support to ensure the long-term sustainability of the UK film industry.",

Some say the challenge is an act of civil disobedience designed to make a statement, especially as President Obama prepares to deliver his speech on climate change from the White House on Monday… Activists said the Global Day of Action should be seen as something other than an act of civil disobedience. \"The goal is not to shut down the airport or the flights,\" said Scott Crowder, an activist in the movement. \"It's a response to a larger system that's broken.\"\n\nNow that's interesting. Not only is this action against a company whose CEO is a billionaire, the protestors are also calling what they're doing an act of civil disobedience while using a hashtag that's been used at multiple mass actions that have involved taking to the street of people's homes and businesses on behalf of specific causes and political aims – i.e. #blacklivesmatter.\n\nThe same is going to happen at airports and on other public streets during the President's speech tonight.\n\nThis is what being \"civil\" looks like?\n\nAs I predicted back shortly after Barack Obama was elected to office, the same thing that once had the public in a frenzy over the threat posed by an \"elite\" who would \"make war on the American people\" is becoming the new mantra that's promoted by those who are now being depicted as \"out of control\" and who are going too far in their \"disruption tactics.\"\n\n\"Civil Disobedience\" has become the brand of those who have the power and control – which is exactly what those who are pushing the \"truce with terrorists\" narrative were able to achieve through their military actions and the use of massive military intervention with no regard for the consequences.\n\nAnd that's why now is where the country is having the hardest time separating fact and fiction when it comes to these events – because people are being bombarded with news reports, television reports and videos that",

    "\"The Last King of Scotland\" is a cinematic tour de force, gracefully navigating the treacherous political landscape of Uganda under the rule of Idi Amin. Directed with careful precision by Kevin Macdonald, the movie provides an intimate and chilling portrayal of one of the most infamous dictators of the 20th century.\n\nForest Whitaker delivers a career-defining performance as Idi Amin. His portrayal is intricately laced with a mix of charisma, volatility, and predatory menace. His transformation from a charming and passionate leader into a remorseless tyrant is nothing short of remarkable. His mesmerizing performance rightfully bagged him an Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nJames McAvoy holds his own powerfully as the young Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan who unwittingly becomes Amin's personal physician. The evolution of McAvoy's character as he is seduced by Amin's charisma, only to later become entrapped in his reign of terror, pushes the narrative alongside the character of Idi Amin.\n\nThe film's screenplay, based on Giles Foden's novel, is masterful. The directors maintain a balanced narrative, choosing to focus on the relationship between Amin and Garrigan, rather than simply putting Amin’s brutality on display. The movie creates a tense atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, stirring an unsettling blend of fascination and horror.\n\nThe film's cinematography and authentic locations lend it an added layer of realism. The original music by Alex Heffes complements the narrative tone superbly, enhancing the rising tension and drama.\n\n\"The Last King of Scotland\" is an engrossing look into the heart of darkness, filled with riveting performances and profound narrative depth. It is a thought-provoking psychological drama with strong political overtones that offers nuanced storytelling, compelling characters, and a window into a dark chapter in Uganda's history. A must-watch for any lover of historical cinema or powerful performances.",
    "We present an algorithm that can be used to derive the C-W equivalence between two sets of points, given their coordinates and distances. The algorithm is based on the fact that the distance between any pair of points in Euclidean space is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances between them. We show that this result holds even if we assume that the set of points has no boundary. This implies that the C-W equivalence is equivalent to the Euclidean equivalence. In particular, it follows that the C-W equivalence is equivalent to the Euclidean equivalence when the distance between two points is less than or equal to the square root of 2.",

    "\"Tarzan\" is a cinematic masterpiece that beautifully blends animation, storytelling, and music. The film takes us on a journey through the wild jungles of Africa, following the life of the titular character, Tarzan, who is raised by gorillas after being orphaned as a baby. \n\nThe animation is breathtaking, with lush, vibrant landscapes that truly capture the essence of the jungle. The character designs are unique and expressive, adding depth to each character. The animators have done an excellent job in portraying the fluidity and agility of Tarzan's movements, making him seem as much a part of the jungle as the animals he lives with.\n\nThe story is a compelling mix of adventure, romance, and self-discovery. It explores themes of identity, belonging, and the clash between civilization and nature. The narrative is well-paced, with enough twists and turns to keep the audience engaged throughout.\n\nThe voice acting is top-notch, with Tony Goldwyn bringing a sense of vulnerability and strength to Tarzan, and Minnie Driver providing a spirited performance as Jane. The chemistry between the two is palpable, making their romance believable and heartwarming.\n\nThe music, composed by Phil Collins, is a standout. The songs are catchy and emotionally resonant, enhancing the narrative and adding another layer to the storytelling. \"You'll Be in My Heart\" is a particular highlight, encapsulating the bond between Tarzan and his gorilla mother, Kala.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its flaws. The portrayal of the native African characters could have been handled with more sensitivity and depth. Additionally, the villain, Clayton, feels somewhat one-dimensional and could have been developed further.\n\nDespite these minor shortcomings, \"Tarzan\" is a must-watch for animation lovers. It's a visually stunning, emotionally engaging film that leaves a lasting impression. Whether you're a fan of the original Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels or new to the story, this film offers a fresh and captivating take on the legend of Tarzan.",
    "\"The Woman in Black\" is a chilling, atmospheric horror film that successfully revives the classic gothic ghost story. The film is set in a remote English village, where a young lawyer, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is sent to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman. The eerie, desolate setting is a character in itself, contributing to the overall sense of dread and unease that permeates the film.\n\nRadcliffe delivers a solid performance, effectively shedding his Harry Potter persona to portray a man haunted by both literal and figurative ghosts. His character's growing fear and desperation are palpable, making the audience share in his terror. The supporting cast also does a commendable job, adding depth to the story without detracting from its central mystery.\n\nThe film's greatest strength, however, lies in its ability to create suspense. Rather than relying on cheap jump scares, \"The Woman in Black\" builds tension gradually, using unsettling imagery and a haunting score to create a sense of impending doom. The titular Woman in Black is a terrifying presence, her appearances marked by a palpable shift in atmosphere.\n\nThe film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the story to unfold slowly and giving the audience time to become invested in the characters. The plot is engaging, with enough twists and turns to keep viewers guessing until the end. The climax, while somewhat predictable, is nonetheless satisfying and leaves a lasting impression.\n\n\"The Woman in Black\" is not without its flaws. Some may find the pacing too slow, and the plot relies heavily on genre tropes. However, these minor issues do not detract from the overall experience. The film is a well-crafted, genuinely scary ghost story that pays homage to the classics of the genre while offering something new and unique.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Woman in Black\" is a must-see for horror fans. It is a testament to the power of atmosphere and suspense in creating fear, proving that a good ghost story can be just as terrifying as any slasher film. With its strong performances, engaging plot, and genuinely creepy atmosphere, \"The Woman in Black\" is a standout entry in the horror genre.",
    "\"30 Days of Night\" proves to be an impressive advancement in the vampire genre, cultivating a sense of chilliness that is both literal and figurical. With its compelling premise, the film creates an eerie and foreboding setting that works remarkably in its favor.\n\nIn the icy cold town of Barrow, Alaska, the movie thrives on its unique selling point - a whole month of uninterrupted nightfall, an ideal feeding ground for vampires. This atmospheric backdrop not only accentuates the terror, but also skillfully brings out the isolation and helplessness of the characters.\n\nThe relatively unknown cast delivers a commendable performance. Josh Hartnett's portrayal of Eben Oleson is impressively nuanced, and his dynamic with Melissa George (Stella Oleson) is both believable and compelling.\n\nThe film keeps the audience on the edge of their seat with its riveting action. The relentless vampires are unnerving and brutal, and their takeover of the town is an intense watch. Moreover, the dark, grainy cinematography is successful in amplifying the tension.\n\nWhat truly carries this film, however, is the fascinating blend of horror and drama. The movie does not rely solely on jump scares but delves into its characters, their relationships, and their struggle for survival in these inhumane conditions.\n\nOn the downside, the film does fall into occasional genre clichés and could have done more with its interesting concept. Some key characters could have been given more development.\n\nWhether you're a fan of vampire lore or not, \"30 Days of Night\" integrates chilling scares alongside a certain depth, with its narrative twists. This film grabs onto an innovative and frightening concept then bites down hard. For those seeking a fresh perspective on the saturated vampire genre, \"30 Days of Night\" will surely keep your pulse running and make your blood run cold.",
    "I've been dating this guy for a month now. I have an older brother on Skype, and we recently started talking about being roommates, so naturally we were sharing our stories through that medium as we both tried to come to terms with recent events, so much family drama and so many moving parts in our lives... He had already invited me over to his place during my Mother's trip last week (she left early and it was our mother's birthday party), and we planned to hang out again after it ended. When I got home that night before going to bed, he said he had something important to tell me... I didn't even want to respond right away because I felt like maybe he just wanted some fun time hanging out with a friend that also happened to be a girl! But finally when I was doing stuff around my room to prepare myself for a busy day tomorrow morning – at which time he'll still be gone for 2 hours… -he asked what I wanted him to do.. So I told her that I really wanted the two of us to get a hotel together after she goes back. After all, it always seemed appropriate that in a relationship there should have to be an element of compromise – not only should you never try to force yourself onto someone else if they don't feel ready yet, but you also should take things slow, know each other well, have enough boundaries of whom/what they can or cannot do, etc. However, with respect, what I really meant by taking their time was making sure everybody was okay.. That part wasn't difficult, but the issue was how many people I knew were there. We both agreed she looked great tonight, and although I would have appreciated seeing all these friends in person – that would mean dealing with social media for most of them, emailing contacts lists, meeting people I only saw online, and possibly even arranging meetups, etc. So for both of us it made sense to plan ahead and set up one more evening with somebody else… And then I told him that I couldn't think of anybody! I could not bring myself to give out any details or explain anything to him since some girls thought they were attractive, some didn't care, others didn't want guys there more than when they left alone, etc. Then I cried and I couldn't tell anyone what happened until just before leaving for work this morning. I needed those first few moments",
    "I'm in my early 20s and I've been with my girlfriend for about 2 years now. We're both pretty much monogamous, but we have sex occasionally. She's never had an orgasm with me before, so it was kind of exciting when she told me that she wanted to try something new. So I started experimenting with oral sex on her. It wasn't too bad at first, but then she got really turned on and started getting really wet. After a while, I noticed that she didn't want to do it anymore. She said that she felt like she was losing control over herself and that she couldn't get off without me. I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't budge. Then one day, she came into my room and asked me if I would be okay with her having anal sex with me. I agreed because I thought it might help us both feel more comfortable with each other. Well, after a few minutes of foreplay, she starts pushing back against me and I can tell that she's enjoying this. She gets up on all fours and starts rubbing her clit as hard as she can. I start thrusting my hips forward and she starts moaning loudly. I keep going until I cum inside her. She pulls away and says that she feels better than ever. I don't think she realized how good it felt to just let go and let me fuck her. I guess I'll have to see what happens next time.\n\nThis is a very common scenario among young women who are sexually inexperienced. They may not realize that they need to ask their partners if they'd like to try something new. Or they may believe that they should only give their partner orgasms once. But there are many reasons why a woman may not be able to achieve orgasm through intercourse alone. For example, some women may find themselves unable to climax due to physical problems such as vaginal dryness or pain during penetration. Other women may simply not enjoy intercourse enough to reach orgasm. In these cases, it's important to discuss your desires with your partner. If you're still unsure whether or not you want to try anal sex, it's best to wait until you're ready to explore this option.",
    "Hi, Just trying to get a sense of what it's like. How do you deal with a girl who is the ultimate \"you shouldn't ask, you should just let her say no\" type? I'm thinking of this from a purely defensive perspective, but it's really hard to be the kind of guy who just lets these girls get away with their bullshit. It'll be worse if I have shitty game and they're really nice girls that I've just met. It could be that I'm overcompensating and that I go full defensive and fuck up and my dick gets hard and I don't think of my girls too much and I'm too busy worrying about this girl and my ego gets in the way, what are your suggestions to someone in this situation? I've been the kind of guy you'd call \"mean,\" but I've been in relationships with girls who aren't that kind. Some of them were pretty horrible as well, and while I liked them I probably was a little sexist with them that way and I can see why that's seen as a way to put me down. But then again some of them were really decent people who actually didn't mind me \"stalking\" them in some way, so it's possible that my views on women have been warped and I'm the one that should be ashamed. It's also really hard to not be defensive when my girlfriend is the one who wants me to be nice to her. In an ideal world she'd just be okay with me being just like \"fuck her in the ass\" and just having sex with whatever pussy I feel like with, but I think that for some reason she isn't that way, and maybe it's because she feels like I'm trying to dominate her, like she's not worth giving my attention to. I'm not really sure, but maybe the way I've been thinking might be getting to this girl that I like, and if that's me thinking that I should be doing things to get her to not like me, and so her \"not liking me\" is a good thing, that's kind of messed up. The more I think about it, all the girls I've dated who were not horrible were also the kind of girls that I liked, the kind that we could go out and hang out with, the kind that got along well with other people because they were decent and",

    "In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve constrained maximum aposteriori (MAP) inference problems in high dimensional spaces with multiple constraints and parameters that are not independent but rather related through some underlying structure such as sparsity or low rankness [1]. We show how our method can be used on several applications including sparse PCA/ICA decompositions where one wishes both components have small support sets while also being uncorrelated; robust regression under normality assumptions when outliers may exist among data points which would otherwise bias estimates towards zero mean values if unaccountedfor during estimation procedures like ordinary least squares(OLS). Our approach builds upon recent advances made by others who developed algorithms capableof handling these types tasks efficiently using convex optimization techniques[2], however they only considered cases involving single parameter settings whereas ours allows users flexibility over what type constraint should apply at each step along way without sacrificing computational efficiency due touseful implementation strategies based off linear programming theory.\"",

She was very popular and had lots of friends, but she wasn't really interested in dating or anything serious. About two months ago, she started to act different towards me. She would always be talking about how she wanted to go out more and see more people, and that she didn't want to spend all her time with me anymore. It got to the point where I felt like I couldn't talk to her because she wouldn't listen to what I said. I tried to tell her that it's not okay to just ignore you when you're having fun, but she wouldn't listen. After a few weeks of this, I decided to break up with her. I told her that I loved her and that I wanted to stay together, but she refused to accept it. She kept saying that she loves me too much and that she doesn't care if I don't want to date anymore. I finally broke up with her after a week of being angry and crying every day. I feel so betrayed by her. I know that she has feelings for me, but she never showed them to me. I think that she feels guilty about cheating on me and wants to make sure that I won't find out. I don't know what to do. I love her so much, but I can't stand seeing her sad and depressed.

They have no money, they have no job prospects, and they have no social life. The only thing keeping them from suicide is the fact that they are afraid of losing their boyfriend/girlfriend.

A loving relationship where one person gives everything to another person.\n\n2. An abusive relationship where one person abuses the other person physically, emotionally, financially, etc.\n\n3. A non-abusive relationship where one person does not abuse the other person.\n\nIf you",
    "This film was made in 1997, and it's about four girls who are called Spices (Melanie Brown aka Scary), Mel C., Emma Bunton & Geri Halliwel) They're all very pretty but they can't sing or dance at first so their manager puts them through training to become pop stars! The story line isn’t that great because there really aren‘ t any plot twists except when one spice gets pregnant by her boyfriend which causes some drama between friends until she has an abortion then everything goes back normal again…but overall this flick rocks!! It definitely deserves 5 outta 10 points!!!",
    "First introduced in [1], the Hermite function is a unique polynomial whose polynomial coefficients are constant and whose coefficients are non-repeating. In this paper, we study its behavior under nonlinear equations in the form of a special case of the well-studied function of the first degree. We prove a non-linearity for an analogous Hermite polynomial \\(L\\) with the same polynomial coefficients, but with different polynomial coefficients: the non-repeating ones of \\(L\\) vanish.\n\nSee the paper for an introduction to the special case and the derivation of the theorem.\n\n[1] A.C.

    "The future of wireless internet connectivity is set to take a giant leap forward with the development of next-generation Wi-Fi technology, promising faster speeds, greater capacity, and improved performance.\n\nThe new technology, known as Wi-Fi 6E, is expected to revolutionise the way we connect to the internet, offering speeds up to three times faster than the current Wi-Fi 6. This souped-up version of Wi-Fi is designed to cope with the increasing demand for high-speed internet in our homes and workplaces, as more devices become internet-enabled and data-heavy activities like streaming and gaming become more prevalent.\n\nWi-Fi 6E operates on a higher frequency band than previous versions, which allows for faster data transmission and less congestion. This means that more devices can connect to the network at the same time without slowing down the overall speed. \n\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance, the global network of companies that drives the adoption of Wi-Fi worldwide, has already begun certifying devices for Wi-Fi 6E. This means that consumers can expect to see routers, smartphones, laptops, and other devices equipped with this new technology hitting the market in the near future.\n\n\"Wi-Fi 6E will bring remarkable improvements in wireless performance,\" said Edgar Figueroa, CEO of the Wi-Fi Alliance. \"It will support the growing number of connected devices, provide greater bandwidth for data-intensive applications, and pave the way for new innovations in technology.\"\n\nHowever, the rollout of Wi-Fi 6E will not be without challenges. The higher frequency band it operates on, known as the 6GHz band, is currently used by other services such as satellite links and radar systems. This means that regulatory approval will be needed in many countries before Wi-Fi 6E can be widely adopted.\n\nDespite these hurdles, the potential benefits of Wi-Fi 6E are significant. With the ongoing global pandemic forcing many people to work and study from home, the demand for reliable, high-speed internet has never been greater. Wi-Fi 6E could be the solution to this problem, providing a faster, more stable connection for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may still be some time before Wi-Fi 6E becomes commonplace, its potential to transform our digital lives is undeniable. As we continue to rely more heavily on the internet for work, education, and entertainment, the arrival of souped-up Wi-Fi is a development that is eagerly anticipated.",
    "This academic paper presents an extensive study on the electrical properties of bismuth-implanted amorphous chalcogenide films. The paper details the methods employed for the production and testing of these films, primarily concentrating on ion implantation as a technique for modifying their resistive and capacitive attributes. The paper employs a comprehensive analysis of the obtained data, including I-V (current-voltage) and C-V (capacitance-voltage) characteristics. Further, it discusses the connection between said electrical attributes and the device's prospective applicability in non-volatile memory devices, optical discs and switching technologies. It provides substantial evidence to support the idea that bismuth-implantation significantly affects the electrical properties of amorphous chalcogenide films. The investigation's findings propose theories for the changes observed, resulting in an enhanced comprehension of the subject matter and potential applications for these technologies.\n",

    "I've known my roommate for over two decades. We've been through thick and thin together, shared countless memories, and have always been there for each other. However, over the past few months, I've noticed a significant change in their behavior. They've become completely engrossed in their Discord server, to the point where it's affecting our friendship.\n\nThey're always on their computer or phone, chatting away with people from all over the world. I understand the appeal of online communities, but it's gotten to the point where they're neglecting our real-life relationship. They're constantly distracted, even when we're in the same room together. They barely engage in conversation, and when they do, it's usually about something that happened on their server.\n\nI've tried to express my concerns, but they just brush it off, saying that I wouldn't understand because I'm not part of the server. I've even tried joining the server to see what all the fuss is about, but it's just not my thing. I miss the times when we used to hang out, watch movies, play video games, or just chat about our day. Now, it feels like I'm living with a stranger.\n\nI'm at a loss for what to do. I don't want to lose my friend, but I also don't want to continue feeling ignored and unimportant. I'm hoping someone here has been through a similar situation and can offer some advice. How can I approach this situation without pushing them away? How can I make them understand that their addiction to their Discord server is affecting our friendship?",
    "This paper presents a novel approach for brain image segmentation by combining Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) and Conjugate Gradient (CG) methods. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of brain image segmentation, a critical task in medical imaging for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. The HMRF model is used to capture spatial dependencies in the image, while the CG method is employed to optimize the energy function of the HMRF model. Experimental results on various brain images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional segmentation methods in terms of both segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. The paper also discusses potential applications of this approach in other medical imaging tasks.",

    "This film has been in development hell since it was first announced, and now that it's finally here, I'm not sure what to think about it. It's an action-packed superhero flick with some great performances (especially Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman), but there are so many problems with this movie that it makes me wonder if they're trying too hard to make it work. The story is pretty basic, and while it does have some good moments, it also feels like it's just throwing everything at you. There are no real stakes or anything else that would keep me watching through the whole thing. And then there's the fact that the director, Patty Jenkins, is one of the most divisive directors working today. She's made some really bad movies over the years, including \"Monster,\" which is probably her worst film ever. But she's also made some really good ones, such as \"Monster Hunter.\" So why did she decide to go with this one? Well, I guess because she wanted to be part of the DC Extended Universe, and she thought that this would be a good way to do it. But I don't know how much of that is true. This isn't even remotely close to being a good movie. It's just a mess.\n\nI've seen the trailer, and I can tell you right off the bat that this movie will not be for everyone. If you're looking for something that's going to entertain you, this might not be your best bet. However, if you're looking for something that's going to challenge you, this could be the movie for you. You'll see plenty of action scenes, and you'll get to see some great fight sequences between Diana Prince and Steve Trevor. Plus, you'll get to see a lot of other characters from the comics come to life on screen.\n\nBut let's talk about the actual plot. The movie opens up with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) waking up after having been unconscious for several days. She wakes up in a cave, where she meets Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). He tells her that he's been sent by Ares (David Thewlis) to find her. They meet up with another character named Etta Candy (Robin Wright), who tells them that she knows where Diana is. After finding out that Diana is in the desert, they head back to Themyscira.\n\nAfter arriving at Them",

    "\"Angels & Demons\", directed by Ron Howard, is a thrilling adaptation of Dan Brown's best-selling novel. The film is a rollercoaster ride of suspense, mystery, and action that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\n\nTom Hanks delivers a stellar performance as Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist who is called upon to solve a deadly conspiracy in the heart of the Vatican. Hanks' portrayal of Langdon is both intelligent and relatable, making the character's journey throughout the film all the more engaging.\n\nThe film's plot is intricate and well-constructed, with a series of twists and turns that keep you guessing until the very end. The narrative is fast-paced and never lets up, making for a truly exhilarating viewing experience.\n\nThe cinematography is another standout aspect of \"Angels & Demons\". The film beautifully captures the grandeur and majesty of Rome and the Vatican, making for some truly breathtaking visuals.

McGregor, in particular, is a standout, bringing a sense of depth and complexity to his character.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its flaws. Some may find the plot a bit too convoluted, and the film's pacing can be uneven at times. Additionally, while the film does a good job of explaining the complex symbolism and history involved in the plot, some viewers may find these elements confusing.\n\nDespite these minor issues, \"Angels & Demons\" is a thrilling and engaging film that is sure to keep viewers hooked from start to finish. With its strong performances, intricate plot, and stunning visuals, it's a film that's well worth watching.",
    "So, this happened a few years ago when I was in my early twenties. I was at a friend's house party, and we decided to drop some acid. It was my first time, and I was both excited and nervous. \n\nThe trip started off great. Colors were more vibrant, sounds were more intense, and I felt a deep connection with everyone around me. We were all having a blast, just hanging out, listening to music, and enjoying the trip. \n\nA few hours in, someone suggested we go for a walk. It seemed like a great idea at the time. We were in a suburban area, so we weren't too worried about running into anyone. We set off, a group of about six of us, laughing and joking as we wandered the streets. \n\nSuddenly, we saw flashing lights in the distance. We all froze, our laughter dying in our throats. The lights were getting closer, and we realized it was a police car. Panic set in. We were all tripping, and the last thing we wanted was to interact with the police. \n\nWithout thinking, I took off running. I could hear my friends calling after me, but I didn't stop. I ran through backyards, jumped over fences, and even waded through a small creek. I was convinced the cops were right behind me, even though I never actually saw them. \n\nEventually, I ended up in a wooded area. I hid there for what felt like hours, my heart pounding in my chest. I was terrified, but also exhilarated. The trees seemed to pulse with life, and I felt like I was part of some grand adventure. \n\nWhen I finally made my way back to my friend's house, everyone was there, safe and sound. Turns out, the cops were just passing by. They hadn't even noticed us. \n\nLooking back, it was a pretty reckless thing to do. But at the time, it felt like the most logical thing in the world. That's the power of acid, I guess. It can make you see things that aren't there, and make you do things you wouldn't normally do. \n\nI've learned my lesson, though. If I ever decide to trip again, I'll make sure to do it in a safe, controlled environment. And I'll definitely stay away from the cops.",

    "\"The Monuments Men\" is a unique blend of history, drama, and adventure that offers a refreshing perspective on World War II. The film, directed by George Clooney, is based on the true story of a group of art historians and museum curators who risk their lives to save priceless works of art from the Nazis. \n\nThe ensemble cast, including Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, and Cate Blanchett, deliver commendable performances. Each character is well-developed, with their own quirks and personalities, making them relatable and engaging. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, adding a layer of authenticity to the narrative.\n\nThe film's plot is intriguing and well-paced, balancing moments of tension and danger with lighter, more humorous scenes. The script is smart and witty, with dialogue that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The film does an excellent job of highlighting the importance of art and culture, and the lengths people will go to preserve it.\n\nVisually, \"The Monuments Men\" is stunning. The cinematography beautifully captures the various European locations, and the attention to detail in the set design and costumes is impressive. The film's score, composed by Alexandre Desplat, complements the narrative perfectly, enhancing the mood and atmosphere.\n\nHowever, the film does have its flaws. Some may find the pacing a bit slow, and the narrative occasionally veers into sentimentality.

    "When I was little, I used to sit in this booth with my mother. This thing floated in at a normal speed and sat on this plate I was holding. We both stared at this thing. I asked her if it was a UFO, and she nodded. I think it was red, but I'm not sure. It was round and looked very...alive. We both stayed pretty quiet after that. I can remember my mother telling me about ghosts on multiple occasions. I don't remember the last time she told me about ghosts, but it was definitely a few years ago.\n\nAs this anecdote shows, the term \"UFOs\" is often used in a looser way to refer to the sighting of lights in the sky, alien encounters, or ghostly phenomena. Such descriptions are useful in that they provide a window into what may be going on, on an individual level. But they are often too vague for the UFO skeptic to be able to make definitive statements about these events. As we'll see in Part 3, it's better to focus on specific cases and to look at the characteristics of such events—not just in terms of their contents, but also their locations, timeframes, and so on.\n\nAs far as I've been able to determine, the above anecdote is from a personal testimony that was uploaded to an online forum for ufology skeptics. It reflects the sort of story many people have experienced—from seeing lights in the sky (often, from their beds), to weird encounters with ghosts, monsters, demons and the like. These types of experiences are often very upsetting. They are the ones that make many people seriously consider religious ideas or become more interested in ghosts and the paranormal.\n\nHowever, I believe there is a simple explanation: all of these types of experiences can be the result of our normal, sleep-deprived minds, dreaming and hallucinating during the night. As discussed earlier, one sign of this is the similarity between lucid dreams and hallucinations, which may be viewed as the same phenomenon from two vastly different perspectives. In Part 3, we will see how this phenomenon can help explain why such a wide variety of phenomena are reported on a nightly basis, and where this leaves the UFO skeptic—one who wants to remain rational but still keep an",
    "There has been widespread speculation that Labour candidate Joan Collins, one of five women running for Westminster seats in Wales, may not be entitled to stand as an MP because she owns some land outside Cardiff Bay. The Labour Party says it will investigate the claims – and whether Collins should have resigned her seat if she had no ownership involvement in the property. But what evidence are we dealing with? BBC Wales asked South Wales Police why it did not take action against Collins over any possible offence on the rural grounds. A spokesman said nothing about any inquiry was under way. It is understood, however, that the investigation into Collins's ownership is considered separate to allegations about the house fire set accidentally when four men used ladders to gain access to a derelict cottage during a break-in in January 2000 – at which point they turned out to be two of Collins's lovers. The former leader of Swansea council's executive committee, Chris Lewis, told BBC Radio Cymru this week that he believed Collins should quit Parliament over what appeared to be a double standards problem as she owned land in Cardiff as well as at the same address. And on Tuesday, Labour MPs said they would launch legal proceedings against Collins after they were sent copies of an email allegedly written by a member of PCC Wylie, Ms Llanelli Williams, who served on Merthyr Tydfil's council between 1996 and 2005 before becoming deputy mayor under Michael Gove. (It alleged \"a man and his family\" living near an alleged seedy drug store run by Collins's lover was committing thefts – despite him being caught stealing at least three times.) A spokeswoman for Lambeth Council, where Collins is a councillor, described her recent conduct as ''totally inappropriate''. She continued: She is also facing charges relating to her alleged role as a prostitute. We can confirm Councillor Joanna Lumley did travel back to Merthyr Tydfil, but the allegation contained within is completely false. On Thursday PwC published its second annual report outlining why Welsh firms should be investing big bucks in emerging markets such as China. According to its figures just 0.2 per cent of the revenues generated in the region last year went to Welsh business.

The proposed approach consists three main steps including preprocessing step which extracts features such contrast enhancement or noise reduction; feature extraction stage where deep learning techniques are applied followed classification process that classifies each pixel according its label value obtained during training phase so it can be used later when making predictions about new data points without having access their labels beforehand like other machine leaning algorithms would require doing before they could make any kind prediction at all! This way there's no need anymore worry whether your algorithm will work well enough because now you know exactly what type error rate should expect if anything goes wrong along these lines…",

    "This paper explores the mathematical concept of permutations through the lens of snow leopard populations. It introduces a novel approach to categorizing these permutations into 'even' and 'odd' threads, analogous to the genetic variations observed in snow leopards. The study employs a combination of mathematical modeling and biological data, providing a unique interdisciplinary perspective. The results reveal intriguing patterns and potential applications in both mathematical theory and conservation efforts. This research not only contributes to our understanding of permutation groups but also offers valuable insights into the genetic diversity and survival strategies of snow leopards.",
    "This academic paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of asymmetric loss functions (ALFs) and deep densely connected networks (DDCNs) in the detection of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions using highly imbalanced medical image segmentation. Previous research studies have suggested that symmetric loss functions do not sufficiently capture the complexity of medical imaging data, which often contains an imbalanced distribution between the classes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique that combines ALFs and DDCNs to enhance the performance of medical image segmentation. Experiment results demonstrate significant improvement in the detection of MS lesions, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in comparison with conventional deep learning algorithms. Our research has significant potential for aiding clinical decision-making and advancing personalized medical treatment.",
    "\"Miracle\" vividly portrays one of the most iconic moments in American sports history - the 1980 US Olympic hockey team's victory over the seemingly invincible Soviet powerhouse. Director Gavin O'Connor masterfully captures the tension, underdog spirit, and human drama behind this 'miracle on ice'.\n\nKurt Russell delivers a commanding performance as Herb Brooks, the hard-nosed coach and mastermind behind the team's success. Russell perfectly embodies the coach’s demanding, abrasive, and yet transformational leadership style that pushed a group of collegiate hockey players to reinforcing them into world beaters.\n\nThe cinematography is absolutely outstanding. The intense, high octane hockey sequences are filmed with a gritty, kinetic energy that puts you right into the heart of the action. You don’t just watch the movie; you're in the rink, feeling every body check, and holding your breath with every shot on goal.\n\nMoreover, \"Miracle\" doesn’t sneak away from raw human emotion. While the sports action is the main dish, it humanizes its characters, showing the pressures they face both on and off the ice. It shows us the men behind the masks, the sacrifice they made, the camaraderie they developed, and the nerves they battled, which adds depth and makes the unlikely success even more gripping.\n\nSpeaking of authenticity, the film's period details are meticulously rendered, effectively transporting viewers back in time to the troubled late 1970s era - a time when America needed a reason to believe in itself again. The movie does a phenomenal job of linking the sports narrative to a larger socio-political atmosphere, subtly reminding us why the victory carried such significance beyond the sporting landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Miracle\" is more than just a hockey movie or a sports movie. It’s a story about determination, teamwork, and the human spirit triumphing against all odds. Its technical accomplishments are matched by its emotional resonance and compelling performances, making this a must-watch whether you are a sports enthusiast or not. Though we know the outcome from the onset, the journey to that climactic moment is captivating from start to finish, a true testament to great filmmaking.",

    "British actress Emma Watson has been honoured as part of the Women in Entertainment Rising Stars Project, which honours women who have made an impact on American society to date. The award was given by Variety for her work in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", and it came after Watson earned raves with her role in the last instalment on 12 May – or rather, before she showed up as a patron in October's Harry Potter finale. She played Hermione Granger, the head Ofsted inspector turned Hogwarts schoolteacher – a job that requires more than having an IQ score of 178! If she knew what was good for her before, what does she know now? According to an article written shortly after her performance, she believes herself to be better at cooking (\"I like everything with butter,\" she admitted), reading, and dancing than most young girls.\n\nIf you have read the story I presented earlier today in this blog (in light of previous articles entitled \"Emma Watson Reveals What We Can Learn From Her Role In 'Crazy Stupid Love' By Charlie Brooker\"), then you would know that British MP Louise Mensch claims publicly that the government's security apparatus monitors, electronically wiretaps, and spooks her phone calls from time to time using equipment created, installed, operated and maintained by the UK intelligence service MI6. It should surprise no one if some kind of spying operation targeted Emma Watson for surveillance while filming \"Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them\". So that's what we have here!\n\nSome people are claiming that \"Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them\" should not be seen as feminist propaganda but rather as a literary masterpiece that tells an original and moving tale about Newt Scamander and his wizarding friends exploring dangerous new territory within the wizarding world (which would, naturally, involve magical creatures). Other viewers see nothing wrong with sexism and anti-feminist sentiment within these films. After all, Rowling says that there's also misogyny in the books, because… um… men?\n\nWell before anyone can come to that conclusion, let me briefly point out that I am by none means defending any sexist attitudes that might have arisen from having grown up around JKR's fantasy novels. I'm quite happy to admit many mistakes made, although I feel it absolutely necessary when writing on something so politically sensitive to take great care never to suggest",

    "Sherlock in 'A Game of Shadows' (2007)\n\nThis may not qualify as a spoiler, I have only seen this one film though it was released a few years ago as an HD DVD that also had a digital transfer. The reason for this? For some strange reason I'm not sure I did like it.\n\nI was quite excited to see this movie. Sherlock Holmes has always been my favorite character and I love classic detective stories and movies on television. When Robert Downey Jr played Dr. Watson back in 2012 we got another iteration that didn't work for me but we still weren't too disapointed because he eventually replaced Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes in the 2015 Movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch. This new version in this movie made this movie a bit enjoyable. Both Cumberbatch and Mark Gatiss were really excellent performers although I felt their roles went out of kilter with what made Sherlock such a great character to begin with (like how both ended up being criminals). Even though Sherlock's personality seemed toned down I still enjoyed him overall but his role in the story wasn't as original or fresh as what we've seen so far in previous versions (and even more so than Gatiss'). And I actually liked the main villain even though he was overplayed at times which made up for certain things i think you'll agree with me. But that's just us so let's try and keep our expectations realistic anyway. My biggest problem with this whole production? I'm not crazy about the music/sound effects/etc that were put into this movie. So I'd rate this as average. Oh right there's other problems I mentioned earlier regarding sound. Other than that. It was funny and entertaining and was very well acted by David Boreanaz and Martin Freeman. We all should check out \"Sherlock\" if you enjoyed seeing John Watson from 'Sense8' in this modern day kind of way..if you enjoy modern-day thrillers then this may make your ears perk up!

    "A call has been made for an overhaul of Britain's state pension system, with one expert saying it was \"a disgrace\".\n\nProfessor John Hills, director of pensions at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said that while he did not think the current system was fair, there were other ways in which people could save money.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government should consider introducing a universal basic income - or a payment given unconditionally to all citizens regardless of their circumstances.\n\nProf Hills also called on the government to introduce a new way of calculating the amount of tax paid by each individual.\n\nIn his speech, Prof Hills said: \"I don't think we are doing enough to make sure that people have enough to live on and I do think that the state pension is a disgrace.\"\n\n'Unfair'\n\nBut he added: \"There are some things you can do about it. You can increase the age of eligibility for the state pension so that people who are older get more than they would otherwise get.\n\n\"You can change the way you calculate your tax bill so that people who earn less pay more tax than they might otherwise pay.\n\n\"And you can look at how you measure what you're paying for and say 'well, if we just take into account the value of the goods and services that people buy then we'll be able to give them a better deal'.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The state pension age currently stands at 65 for men and 66 for women\n\nProf Hills said that the government had already taken steps towards changing the state pension age but that these changes had not yet gone far enough.\n\nHe said: \"We've got to go further because the state pension age is going up again next year. It will rise to 67 for men and 68 for women. That means that people born after 1980 will start getting a bigger state pension than those born before 1950.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's unfair that people born in the 1960s and 1970s are getting a much larger state pension than people born in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n\"That's why I'm calling for a fundamental review of the state pension age.\"\n\nThe IFS says that the average annual state pension in the UK is £1,300 per person, compared with £2,",
    "Renowned Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio has been recognized for his immensely successful career with an illustrious commendation in the performing arts.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actor, who has an illustrious acting career spanning several decades, was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award at a prestigious gala event held in Beverly Hills, California. \n\nDiCaprio, 46, was recognized for his significant contribution to the entertainment industry and his commitment to bringing compelling stories and complex characters to life on the silver screen.

    "To me, it seemed ridiculous that Americans would pay so much more on an average taxpayer's salary just because they don't like public school systems and believe them too liberal (which does not have anything do with my critique here). I had thought about this issue often before finally deciding maybe there was another way--a better method by which everyone can get excellent free schooling no matter how poor or wealthy their parents are able/willing spend money every year per kid plus help support others who need financial aid but still qualify equally if possible depending only what each individual child needs when reaching high enough SAT score marks after passing college entrance tests at whatever local level those numbers vary statewide national globally etc..

    "This film was based on Michael Lewis' book, which in turn came out after Billy Beane's Oakland A’s had already won three straight division titles and made it to two consecutive World Series (2002-2003). The story begins with an introduction by Brad Pitt as himself explaining how he became interested enough about this subject matter that led him into making his first documentary feature “Minersville”. He then introduces us all around baseball including some players who have been traded away or released due their age such like Jason Giambi & Tim Hudson among others while also showing footage clips taken during games played between 2001 through 2003 seasons where we see what happened behind closed doors when these teams were competing against each other at different times throughout those years leading up until now today! It wasn't just one person either; there are many people involved here too – coaches managers owners etcetera…but most importantly they're not afraid take risks even if means going outside traditional methods used within professional sports leagues across America nowadays because sometimes change can be good thing especially since everyone knows nothing lasts forever no? So let me tell you why Money Ball works so well despite being criticized heavily before its release date back 2005/2006 time period -because unlike any previous films produced under Hollywood standards thus far none ever dared touch upon subjects related directly towards business practices employed inside major league organizations themselves unless done indirectly via fictionalized accounts created solely meant entertainment purposes only without regard whatsoever toward reality itself regardless whether true factually accurate representation exists somewhere else entirely separate altogether unrelated sources elsewhere online offline anywhere really doesn‘t make much difference anymore does anyone care anyway??

The piece aims to comprehensively understand and illustrate the computational complexity inherent in these mechanisms. For certain classes of problems and particular algorithmic tools, we prove that these mechanisms are computationally tractable. Other classes of problems demonstrate evidence of NP-Hardness or even P-Space hardness, making their dynamic mechanism design computationally intractable. Our findings shed light on the limitations and possibilities in the field of dynamic mechanism design and can help in devising more efficient algorithms. Future work needs to explore the trade-offs between the design's efficiency and computational tractability.",
    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've had a few issues with my vibrator. The first was that it would sometimes get stuck in the slot on the base and wouldn't turn off. It's a little annoying because you can't just unplug it to fix it (unless you have a spare one). Then there were times when it would be too sensitive for me to use and I'd end up having to stop using it altogether. Finally, I noticed that the vibrations weren't as strong as they should be. They felt like they were coming out of the wrong side of the toy instead of the other way around. So I decided to try something new. I bought a cheapo $10 vibrating bullet vibe from Amazon. I figured since it wasn't anything special, I could probably figure out how to make it work. Turns out, it's pretty easy! Here are some pictures of what I did: 1) Unscrew the battery cover 2) Remove the two screws holding the battery inside 3) Pull the battery out 4) Put the batteries back in 5) Screw the battery back into place 6) Plug the battery into your computer 7) Open up the app on your phone 8) Click on the \"Vibrate\" button 9) Select \"Battery\" 10) Choose the battery you want to charge 11) Set the time you want to charge it 12) Click \"Start Vibration\" 13) Wait until the vibration stops 14) Turn the vibrator off 15) Enjoy your new vibrator!",

The proposed approach consists three main steps; first step involves generating FoIs around nuclei regions which are then classified into two classes based on their mitosis statuses i.e., normal or abnormal cell division process with high accuracy rate (>90%). Second stage includes training CNN models that can predict whether each nucleus belongs either class correctly without any human intervention while third one uses these predictions along other features extracted directly form image pixels themselves like color intensity values etcetera so they could be combined together later during final decision making phase where all information gathered thus far will help decide if there exists enough evidence supporting presence/absence within given region respectively.\"",
    "Hello, and thank you for letting this question be part of the survey! Reddit users are interested in how their tastes might have changed over time as they play different titles. We're very curious about when people move into gaming, so to see if we can give us an idea that will help us better understand how our interests change now versus 20 years ago, maybe let's look at what kinds of games made it on to the NES platform or PlayStation™... I've been playing since my family bought me one growing up, mostly before school was out in my area and while still doing my homework! My main experience with the medium has mostly come from Playstation, and yes, when i saw that there were no online capabilities (or even LAN), those first 2 Kirby games really put a dent in my interest in videogames. The second I tried the Xevious arcade game… that was an unforgettable 8-bit experience. Since then i've also had some good experiences with various RPG games like Diablo 2 etc as well as the Halo franchise from Bungie which inspired my love of military shooters. But most recently my life got pretty hectic after finishing college with a few kids into homeschooling which resulted in me finally getting around to trying the new GTA V (a huge disappointment for me).

    "In a significant technological advancement, a multi-purpose television set has been developed in India, aiming to revolutionize the way people consume media and access essential services. This innovative device is not just a source of entertainment, but also a tool for education, healthcare, and e-commerce, making it a game-changer in the Indian market.\n\nThe multi-purpose TV, developed by a Bangalore-based tech start-up, is equipped with smart features that go beyond the traditional functions of a television. It is designed to cater to the diverse needs of the Indian population, particularly those in rural and semi-urban areas who have limited access to digital services.\n\nOne of the key features of this TV is its in-built educational content, which can be accessed without an internet connection. This is expected to bridge the digital divide in education, especially in remote areas where online learning is a challenge due to poor internet connectivity. The TV comes pre-loaded with a wide range of educational materials, including video lectures, e-books, and interactive learning tools, catering to students from primary to higher secondary levels.\n\nIn addition to education, the multi-purpose TV also serves as a platform for telemedicine services. Users can consult with doctors, book appointments, and even order medicines through the TV. This feature could prove to be a boon for those living in areas with inadequate healthcare facilities.\n\nThe TV also integrates e-commerce functionalities, allowing users to shop from a wide range of products, from groceries to electronics, directly from their television sets. This feature is expected to boost digital commerce in rural areas, where access to physical retail outlets is often limited.\n\nThe multi-purpose TV is also environment-friendly, powered by solar energy, making it a sustainable choice for consumers. It also comes with a built-in battery backup to ensure uninterrupted services during power outages, a common occurrence in many parts of India.\n\nThe developers of the multi-purpose TV believe that this innovation could transform lives, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. They hope that it will not only provide entertainment but also empower users with access to essential services, thereby contributing to the digital inclusion drive in India.\n\nThe multi-purpose TV is set to hit the market in the coming months, and it will be interesting to see how it is received by the Indian consumers. If successful, it could set a new trend in the television industry, not just in India, but globally.",
    "Abstract\n\nWe present CAKES, an automatic channel-wise shrinking algorithm that automatically shrinks the size of a network by minimizing the cost function over all possible paths between nodes in the network. The algorithm is based on the idea that the optimal path through a network consists of two parts: (i) the shortest path to any node and (ii) the minimum number of hops required to reach each node. We show that CAKES can be used as a generalization of the standard k-means clustering algorithm to handle large networks with many edges. Our results demonstrate that CAKES can significantly reduce the computational time needed to perform k-means clustering.",

    "In most countries, the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, including all Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories, have entered the public domain. However, in Finland, this is not the case due to a peculiar quirk in their copyright laws.\n\nFinland's copyright law is based on the \"life plus 70 years\" principle, which means that a work enters the public domain 70 years after the death of its author. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle died in 1930, so his works should have entered the public domain in 2001. However, there's a catch.\n\nIn Finland, if a work has been published posthumously, the copyright extends 70 years from the date of the author's death or 70 years from the date of the posthumous publication, whichever is longer. In the case of Doyle, a collection of his short stories, \"The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes\", was published posthumously in 1927, three years before his death. \n\nHowever, one story in this collection, \"The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place\", was not published until 1934, four years after Doyle's death. This means that, according to Finnish law, the copyright on all of Doyle's works will not expire until 70 years after the publication of this story, i.e., in 2024.\n\nSo, due to this unusual circumstance, Finnish fans of Sherlock Holmes must wait a few more years before they can freely access and share these beloved stories. It's a fascinating example of how different countries' copyright laws can lead to unexpected situations!",
    "England rugby star Jonny Wilkinson has been ruled out of the upcoming Six Nations match against Ireland due to injury. The fly-half sustained a leg injury during training and will not be fit in time for the crucial clash.\n\nWilkinson, who has 91 caps for England, was expected to play a key role in the match at Twickenham. His absence is a significant blow to England's hopes of securing a victory against the Irish side.\n\nThe 32-year-old player suffered the injury during a training session on Tuesday. Medical staff initially hoped it was a minor issue, but further examination revealed a more serious problem that will require a recovery period of several weeks.\n\nEngland coach, Eddie Jones, expressed his disappointment at the news but remained optimistic about the team's chances. \"Jonny is a world-class player and his experience and leadership are invaluable to us,\" Jones said. \"However, we have depth in our squad and I am confident the players we have can step up and deliver a strong performance.\"\n\nWilkinson's replacement has not yet been announced, but it is likely that either George Ford or Owen Farrell, both of whom have been in excellent form this season, will take his place.\n\nThe match against Ireland is crucial for England's Six Nations campaign. After a disappointing loss to France in their opening match, England bounced back with a convincing win over Italy. A victory against Ireland would keep their championship hopes alive.\n\nWilkinson, who famously kicked the drop goal that won England the World Cup in 2003, has had a career plagued by injuries. Despite this, he remains one of the most respected figures in international rugby.\n\nFans will undoubtedly be disappointed not to see Wilkinson in action, but will be hoping that his absence does not derail England's Six Nations campaign. The match against Ireland takes place at Twickenham on Saturday.",
    "This study presents a novel approach to semantic segmentation using hierarchical psychometric learning, a technique that integrates insights from psychology with machine learning methodologies. We propose a hierarchical model that employs psychometric properties to gain a deeper understanding of data structures and improve semantic segmentation results. In contrast to existing approaches, this method efficiently manages diverse features and high-dimensional data, thereby enhancing the accuracy of object recognition. Our approach is extensively evaluated and benchmarked against existing semantic segmentation techniques, and the results illustrate notable improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. The findings offer significant potential for a myriad of applications, including image understanding, localization, and scene understanding in computer vision.",

    "Video games, often seen as a source of entertainment, are increasingly being recognised for their potential in enhancing learning and cognitive development. A growing body of research suggests that video games can be powerful learning tools, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and even empathy.\n\nThe interactive nature of video games can stimulate learning in a way that traditional methods may not. Players are often required to solve puzzles, strategize, make quick decisions, and adapt to new situations. These skills can be transferred to real-world scenarios, enhancing cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills.\n\nMoreover, video games can also foster creativity. Games like Minecraft, which allow players to build and create their own worlds, can stimulate imagination and creativity. This can be particularly beneficial for children, helping them to develop these skills from a young age.\n\nIn addition to cognitive benefits, video games can also promote social skills. Multiplayer games encourage communication and teamwork, teaching players how to work effectively in a group. This can be particularly beneficial in a world where virtual communication is becoming increasingly important.\n\nFurthermore, video games can also be used as educational tools. Many games are designed with educational purposes in mind, teaching players about history, science, and other subjects in an engaging and interactive way. This can make learning more enjoyable and effective, particularly for students who struggle with traditional teaching methods.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all games offer these benefits. Some games may promote violence or other negative behaviours. Therefore, it's crucial for parents and educators to carefully select games that are appropriate and beneficial for their children or students.\n\nIn conclusion, while video games are often seen as a form of entertainment, they can also be powerful learning tools. By promoting critical thinking, problem-solving skills, creativity, and social skills, video games can help players to 'learn and play' at the same time. However, it's important to choose games wisely to ensure they offer these benefits.",
    "In this work we address a novel form of sputter on polar surfaces, where multiple particles are produced by light trapped within a rotating beam cavity. The result can be defined as an interference pattern, which may show up either symmetrically with respect to the orientation of particle origin/destination or asymmetric. Similar results were obtained previously using light trapping on metallic surfaces using a highly modified type of rotary tunneling microscope (MTM) [4], which permitted a large number of particle pairs in exchange (see Methods). In particular, we exploit this method on thin film graphene prepared in a three-dimensional channel. When one single pair of electrons is transferred across each graphene molecule at a single energy level, an electric potential difference and electromagnetic force arise between two adjacent pairs, that induces their formation in the same direction. As in the case of optical trapping on the metal substrate, we observe a rotation and sputtering effect at much lower frequencies when several such pairs occur in simultaneous locations along a given longitudinal axis [5]. At low atomic voltage (~8 eV), the resulting forces lead to emission waves emanating from nearby electrode locations (E i and E j ) that propagate along the surface, generating a complex system of correlated electronic charge density fluctuations that propagate outwardly throughout the entire sample length. These electric fields are more prevalent near edge regions due to the polarization angle between charged electron centers and oxygen atoms that is slightly different from the normal polarity of oxygen molecules. Since both center charges have approximately 180° symmetry, they create opposite electrical currents and magnetic moments, similar to those found for circular polarized beams (e.g., CVDs; Fig. 3a) whose induced electromagnetic field tends to push electrons toward one another. Thus for our experimental probe setup, only the most intense energy levels are capable of driving these effects on solid films on both sides of a vertical plane perpendicular to the original direction of motion. We also find that while all electron emissions generated upon interaction are directed away from the electrodes owing to the current dependence, the emitted trajectories remain distinct in various orientations depending on the applied directional magnetic field. Because spatial separation and polarization are extremely important parameters in the underlying mechanism (i.e., interparticle electric dipoles during particle generation and then recombination and spin dynamics), they determine how spatially separated excitations generate a complex wavefield with distinctive",
    "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" takes up the gauntlet, thrown by its predecessors, as a most ambitious undertaking of the superhero genre to date – it compiles a complex narrative encompassing the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Throughout the years, the MCU has made an art form of weaving its multiple narratives together, and this film sets a new standard for the tapestry it has created.\n\nThe film kicks off with a tone setter from the first scene itself and dives headfirst into the rage and desperation of war. Every Avenger receives their share of the limelight - the regular outings are standouts as usual, but it's some of the side-players like Doctor Strange, The Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor who really steal the show. The ensemble cast is exceptional, without a single miscast or underperformance.\n\nThe desolate mad titan, Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is a compelling villain characterized by both malevolence and unexpected depth. This emotional complexity makes him one of the most captivating and engaging characters in the movie.\n\nThe Russo Brothers should be praised for their balancing act in ensuring every character is given enough screen-time and significance. The action sequences are visually stunning and the pacing is spot on. The humor hits where it needs to – never feeling forced or jarring alongside the film's darker elements. \n\nHowever, the movie's scope is so vast and its narrative so expansive, it requires a deep immersion into MCU lore to fully appreciate. Casual viewers may find themselves lost amid the numerous intersecting storylines and characters. \n\nDespite being the first part of a two-part story, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" embodies a singular vision which is both grippingly tense and strikingly emotional. It leaves viewers yearning for resolution, setting the bar extremely high for the forthcoming sequel.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is a thrilling and gut-wrenching cinematic experience that rewards long-time fans, while challenging and reshaping the confines of the superhero genre. It is an epic spectacle that leaves you feeling both breathless and speechless.",
    "I've been thinking about this for awhile, and I think it's true that we can change how happy or sad/angry etc...we are by changing what images come to mind when something happens in real life (or even just imagining things). For example if you're walking down an alley at night alone with no one around but there was someone who attacked your friend last week on their way home then chances would be pretty good they'd attack YOU too right? But now imagine instead being surrounded not only friends & family members cheering loudly as well! This could make all difference between feeling scared vs excited because those two scenarios have very different outcomes based solely off whether people were present during them.\"",

    "Abstract The goal of this work was to investigate the effect of multiple targets on the non-coherence of MIMO radar with multiple targets (MIMO) and to determine whether the effects are due to the presence or absence of noise sources. We used an experimental setup consisting of two MIMO antennas, one located at each end of a 2m long optical fiber cable. A single target antenna was placed at the center of the cable. Two different types of noise sources were employed: a low frequency (LF) source that produces a continuous signal and a high frequency (HF) source that generates a periodic signal. In addition, we varied the number of targets per antenna. The results show that the LF source has no significant effect on the non-coherence of the system. However, when there are more than three targets, the HF source significantly reduces the non-coherence of the system. This reduction can be attributed to the fact that the RF energy emitted by the LF source is absorbed by the air molecules in the vicinity of the antenna. The results also indicate that the presence of noise sources does not affect the performance of the system.",

    "\"Grateful Dead's long and storied career has included countless hits, misses, breakthroughs, and more than its share of controversy. Though there may be many who could categorize Grateful Dead music as any one genre or style – folk/Americana? roots rock? jam band?? whatever it was, they all essentially sounded like that if you really listened hard enough, but then what about some songs that sound more akin to pop rock/new wave? So the question must always come up and this is exactly what happened in 1994 with Bob Weir and co.'s entry into what turned out to be an incredible musical journey. With Garcia and his guitar in tow, Jerry sang, played electric for one song (the epic encore 'Truckin') then proceeded to sing, play piano and harmonica until his voice finally betrayed him on the band's very last tune of the night (\"Playing In The Band\").

    "A former employee of the Russian state-owned oil company Yukos has filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming he was forced to sign over his share in the firm's assets to the Kremlin after being fired for refusing to work on behalf of the company's owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The suit claims that Vladimir Yakunin, who was head of Russia's largest private gas producer at the time, and other senior executives were involved in the alleged scheme to force out Mr Khodorkovsky, who had been jailed by President Putin. It also alleges that Mr Yakunin used his position as an executive with Gazprom, the state-controlled energy giant, to pressure him into signing off on the deal. In addition to the $1bn (£640m) payout, the suit says, Mr Yakunin demanded that Mr Khodorkovsky be allowed to keep his stake in Yukos. He also allegedly threatened to cut off all financial support if he did not comply. The case is one of several brought against Mr Khodorkovsky since he fled Russia in 2003. His supporters say he was unfairly targeted because of his political activities. But critics accuse him of using the legal system to protect himself from prosecution.\n\nIn this case, it appears that the plaintiff is suing the Yukos subsidiary, which was owned by the Russian government. This would seem to indicate that the plaintiffs are seeking compensation for their losses due to the actions of the Russian government. However, there is no indication that they have any evidence that the Russian government was directly responsible for the actions of the Yukos subsidiary.\n\nIt should be noted that the lawsuit does not appear to be based upon any specific facts or allegations about the actions of the Russian government. Rather, it seems to be based solely upon the fact that the Russian government owns Yukos. If the Russians were somehow responsible for the actions of the Yukos subsidiary, then the lawsuit would likely fail.",

    "So, I've been playing this game for a while now and I've just noticed something that's been bugging me about enemy sight. It seems like the enemies can spot me from miles away, even when I'm crouched and hidden behind objects. \n\nI've tested this out in various scenarios and it's pretty consistent. I could be behind a wall or a large rock, completely out of sight, but the moment I move, they're instantly alerted to my presence. It's like they have some sort of sixth sense or x-ray vision. \n\nThis is particularly frustrating during stealth missions where remaining undetected is crucial. I've tried adjusting my approach, using different tactics, but nothing seems to work. It's as if the game's AI has been programmed to have an unfair advantage over the player. \n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or if it's an intentional game mechanic, but it's definitely impacting my enjoyment of the game.

    "Germany's unemployment rate has hit a new record low, according to the latest figures from the Federal Employment Agency. The jobless rate has now fallen to 4.9% in a trend that reflects positively on the strength of Europe's biggest economy.\n\nAnalysts had previously predicted this figure, but the milestone endorses Germany's economic stability amid global economic uncertainties, demonstrating potential resilience in the face of international headwinds.\n\nApproximately 2.23 million people were unemployed in Germany last month, the lowest figure recorded since reunification in 1990. This figure is 185,000 fewer than the same period last year and corresponds to a decline of more than 8%.\n\nThe report also highlighted an increase in job vacancies, with around 798,000 open positions reported in April, approximately 6,000 more than during the previous month and 32,000 more than the same period the previous year.\n\n\"The German labour market continues to develop robustly,\" said Detlef Scheele, the head of the Federal Employment Agency. \"Despite a moderate economic development, demand for labour continues to be very high.\"\n\nEconomists assert that Germany´s robust labour market, backed by strong domestic demand, could provide a buffer against potential negative external impacts. These impacts include potential trade uncertainties from Brexit and global trade disputes, as well as slower global economic growth.\n\nAlthough the economy contracted in the third quarter of 2019 and narrowly avoided a recession by posting zero growth in the fourth, Germany’s labour market remained resilient. The strong labour market, record-high employment and rising wages are fuelling a domestically-driven growth upswing, making private consumption an important growth driver.\n\nHowever, despite such a robust labour market, many businesses in the country have reported facing a shortage of skilled workers. The Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry warned last year that the lack of skilled workers could become an increasing problem for Europe's largest economy and could potentially limit its future growth.\n\nIn a tight labour market, economists usually expect wages to rise, fuelling inflation and eventually prompting the European Central Bank (ECB) to hike interest rates. However, wage growth has remained relatively subdued in Germany, keeping inflation in check and allowing the ECB to maintain loose monetary policy.",
    "I was upstairs in my room, doing my own thing when I heard the familiar drone of conference talks filtering up from the living room. Half my family was downstairs, huddled together, hanging onto every word being spoken. I could hear the occasional \"amen\" and the murmurs of agreement. \n\nI used to be a part of that. I used to sit there, nodding along, believing every word that was spoken. I used to think that this was the only way to live, the only way to find happiness and peace. But now, I see it for what it really is - a cult. \n\nI'm not saying this to offend anyone. I respect everyone's right to believe in what they want. But for me, I'm just so grateful that I'm no longer a part of it. I'm grateful that I was able to break free, to question, to think for myself. \n\nIt's not easy, especially when half your family is still so deeply entrenched in it. There are times when I feel like an outsider, when I miss the sense of community and belonging. But then I remember the control, the manipulation, the fear... and I know I made the right choice. \n\nI'm grateful for my freedom. I'm grateful for my ability to think critically and question everything. I'm grateful for the strength to walk away from something that was no longer serving me. \n\nSo while half my family is downstairs, listening to conference talks, I'm upstairs, basking in the peace and quiet, grateful for my journey and the person I've become.",

    "\"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" successfully amplifies the tension and narrative weight of its predecessor, proving itself a worthy second installment of the franchise. There's a great advantage to sequels, particularly those part of a well-mapped series, and \"Catching Fire\" seizes that advantage by catapulting us right into the story without the need for an extensive exposition.\n\nJennifer Lawrence resumes her role as Katniss Everdeen and continues to imbue her character with a potentially lethal combination of vulnerability, volatility, and tenacity. Lawrence's powerful performance once again drives the movie, but let's not forget the equally solid performances of the supporting cast, particularly Woody Harrelson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Josh Hutcherson, who add depth and layers to their respective characters.\n\nFrom a visual point of view, director Francis Lawrence brings a new vision to the table, providing moments that are both visually stimulating and emotionally charged. The portrayal of the Quarter Quell and the eye-catching gowns are particularly noteworthy. The narrative, while largely faithful to the source material, sustains the balance between action and drama. \n\nThat being said, the film is not without its flaws. At times, it seems to be in a rush to juggle the myriad storylines and introduces some characters weakly. However, these instances are forgivable, considering the enormity of the material it is dealing with.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" is a fiery sequel that deepens the two-sided critique of a deprived society and the constructed world of reality television, evoking a range of emotions throughout its runtime. The combination of a top-tier cast, high-stakes action, and a poignant narrative ensures that viewers will be on the edge of the seat, awaiting the next chapter in the series.",

    "Introduction As in any domain, and particularly in medicine, data sets are continuously growing exponentially, and as many of these collections grow, so does the challenge in processing the huge amounts of training data they contain. What can be done to tackle this problem? How can we make it possible in practice for individuals to train models without having lots of time waiting at their machines (like for the famous PASCAL VOC), or the budget available for them, like for medical researchers (which happens sometimes)? In this work, we have studied two techniques which involve explicit information being fed into an implementation of neural networks on a graphical user interface to speed up analysis, i.e. the'small-sampling' method and the deep learning technique named for its use of multiple hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. In addition, it contains an optimisation scheme used to estimate parameters in some submodel during training. Both methods are trained upon MNIST dataset using random sampling. To illustrate our approach, some figures describing MNIST image labels showing both learning curves were generated for some specific examples: The two learning curves may give one the impression that what we achieved seems simple but it turns out that both approaches are quite complex, even when the objective functions remain straightforward. For example, our optimisation scheme tries to estimate the values of the latent variables for each subroutine separately. We then convert those values to weights for inference in the form of gradient descent. We also show how we compute a confidence interval around such estimates by setting the posterior distribution for each variable and applying our algorithm to the samples given by sampling from the expected probability distribution. Finally, because submodels will need to be learnt simultaneously on the first few observations only, many more neurons are required and so the total number of connections in the network does not exactly match the training number per subnetwork. Even after fitting a linear model, we still see overfitting leading to spurious predictions and false positives if some sub-models actually get underfit due to low coverage when actual error is high. This means it is often necessary to perform some type of regularisation to reduce overfitting while preserving precision before applying the regression-based optimization strategy mentioned earlier. Moreover, it should also be noted that such methods could benefit from further optimizations which we have discussed previously such as the optimization to account for interactions between components/functions",

    "\"Bridget Jones's Diary\" is a delightful and relatable romantic comedy that will surely win the hearts of its viewers. This film amazingly captures the essence of modern-day romantic struggles through its flawed yet endearing main character, Bridget Jones, portrayed brilliantly by Renee Zellweger.\n\nZellweger absolutely shines in her portrayal of Bridget. She strikingly captures the charm, vulnerabilities, and insecurities of her character that make her so much more than just a stereotype of a single woman. With her disarming honesty, Bridget Jones becomes a character that many people, not just women, can identify with.\n\nThe script, based on Helen Fielding's novel of the same title, is intelligently adapted to the big screen. It encapsulates the humor and wit from the book while cementing its own identity as a film. The story is filled with hilarious gaffes that will keep you laughing out loud and regretting every moment you've ever sympathized with Bridget's dire situations.\n\nThe supporting cast is also to be applauded. Hugh Grant gives an impeccable performance as the charming yet undependable Daniel Cleaver, and Colin Firth is sublime as the stoic and somewhat aloof Mark Darcy. The romantic tension between these two men and Bridget Jones forms the crux of the film, pushing it forward with their chemistry and charisma.\n\nDirector Sharon Maguire successfully weaves together the humor, romance, and understated drama inherent in the narrative to create a movie experience that’s both enjoyable and emotive. She enables you to root and empathize with Bridget Jones while also entertaining you with a fair amount of comedic relief.\n\n\"Bridget Jones's Diary\" captures the ups and downs of love and life through the eyes of its quirky and unforgettable protagonist. While primarily a chick flick, it breaks the mold through its universally relatable themes. It’s a celebration of the imperfect life, teaching you to find joy and laughter in moments of despair. An engaging watch for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies with a heartfelt twist.",
    "Abstract\n\nWe have tested the hypothesis that underdosing to CWE can give rise only to dynamic dynamics and no static, linear or kinematic effects. This would be the case if there were no d-type cw effect in either hydration behavior (proportional or inverse) or energetics; if each instance is independent of others and follows from the previous one. In order to test this we have investigated two different, related examples illustrating the nature of dynamic interactions with dNAPO: firstly a study of the energy balance on an inertial platform (i.e., where it is assumed that each individual holds its position), secondly the nonlinear effect of hyperhydration described by Schutze (1982). We have investigated both cases under diverse experimental conditions ranging from small mass transfer capacities (3 cm−1) to large ones in which every fluid passage takes 10 s. These results provide some insight into how energetics become dependent on external interactions and allow us to propose quantitative, analytical methods aimed at quantifying the role of these interactions on various aspects of physiology.",
    "US retailers experienced a mixed Christmas season, with some sectors seeing a surge in sales while others struggled, according to data from the National Retail Federation (NRF).\n\nThe NRF reported that holiday sales rose 8.5% compared to the previous year, exceeding its own forecast of a 7.4% increase. However, the gains were not evenly distributed, with sectors such as electronics and appliances, home furnishings, and grocery stores seeing robust growth, while clothing and accessories stores, and department stores suffered.\n\nOnline sales continued to boom, growing by 11% over the holiday period, reflecting the ongoing shift in consumer behaviour towards e-commerce. This was a slight slowdown from the 15% growth seen in 2020, but still represents a significant increase.\n\n\"Consumers were eager to celebrate the holidays and retailers were ready to offer great merchandise, good deals and a safe shopping environment,\" said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay. \"The 2021 holiday season was historic and exceeded expectations, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the American consumer and the retail industry.\"\n\nHowever, the picture was less rosy for clothing and accessories stores, which saw sales drop by 4.2% compared to 2020. Department stores also struggled, with sales down 3.3%. These sectors have been hit hard by the shift to online shopping and changing consumer habits, with many people choosing to spend less on clothing and more on home improvement and electronics.\n\nThe NRF's data also highlighted the impact of supply chain issues, with many retailers struggling to keep popular items in stock. This led to a rise in prices, which may have deterred some consumers from making purchases.\n\nDespite these challenges, the NRF remains optimistic about the outlook for 2022. \"While we are mindful of inflation, the omicron variant and other potential disruptions, we believe that consumers are in a position to spend, and retailers are in a position to meet that demand,\" said Shay.\n\nThe mixed Christmas results reflect the ongoing challenges facing US retailers as they navigate the shift to online shopping, supply chain disruptions, and changing consumer habits.

I'm not sure all these factories are ready to crank up production like that.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether power outages will slow manufacturing output or cause it to slip. After all, many manufacturing facilities have backup power systems, and a downturn in the power business doesn't directly affect factories that use it.\n\nBut the outages have sent some manufacturing employees home for a day or more, raising questions about whether the current economic recovery is already showing signs of slowing.\n\n\"Today's data do demonstrate that it's a real possibility that the manufacturing recovery is running into trouble,\" said Neil Dutta, chief economist at Renaissance Capital Market.\n\nManufacturing output grew 0.2% in September, matching a four-year low.\n\n\"The biggest factor in the expansion in the first half of the year was consumers spending,\" said Mr. Dutta. \"One of the factors now is whether consumers and businesses are going to feel the effects of the downturn they've been going through.\"\n\nThis latest manufacturing contraction could give ammunition to critics — such as congressional Republicans — who cite high levels of unemployment in manufacturing districts in their push to slash income taxes.\n\n\"We're seeing some signs that the recovery is losing momentum,\" said Neil Dutta, chief",
    "I know it's been almost two years since The Internet Exploded, but here's what happened after this episode first aired; in case you missed it... I broke up with my boyfriend because we weren't having sex anymore, and that shit happens to every relationship at some point in time (even if you're getting paid $4-7 million/year for it). My feelings were hurt and that sucked, but I could have moved on right then because he didn't deserve me. Instead I kept feeling guilty about how it sounded when all the other people would say things like \"well you have no idea what you're missing.\" And you know what? It was true. In terms of our sex life, I had lost respect that day after this scene... I wasn't going out with him so much as just staying in bed and hoping he wouldn't leave me for someone more perfect, or worse, than me. So when the show came through like, six days later, I decided you can call me crazy for whatever reason you wanted to -- I knew something special happened between us. You might not believe this, but once I saw those pictures we shared over FaceTime a few months prior, I got really angry at myself. I had felt stupid for crying for my parents' sake, but I couldn't get this image out of my head. This guy looked so sweet. Just adorable, and not only that there was nothing creepy or embarrassing about me looking so happy in front of his webcam when he promised to never take any photos and keep the video tape secret so I could watch it all unfold whenever I'd like. We stayed together long enough, though, to figure something else out... I didn't have a car so going places was scary. But before long, I was driving around, eating tacos, wearing baggy shorts, laughing the hardest I ever had in my entire life, telling him I loved him and thinking about all-nighters when we were too tired to see each other. (In college these thoughts probably did come very easy... even though we still lived together after an affair ended the day I graduated.) By this point, I finally thought to ask him exactly why he was asking me back when I've already broken up with someone else, but being the person I am, he was so confused by it he just laughed it off.

    "We present a study of the luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) and mass-metallicity (M-Z) relations for a sample of compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at redshifts 0 < z < 3.

    "A former vice president of US air conditioning company Boeing pleaded guilty in federal court on Tuesday to a single federal charge of taking bribes to steer business to his employer's subsidiaries.\n\nTimothy Geithner, 62, who served as head of Boeing's air conditioning division between 2006 and 2009, was arrested in March and accused of accepting more than $1m in bribes in exchange for giving Airbus sales contracts that benefited Boeing.\n\nA lawyer for Mr Geithner said on Tuesday his client \"is going to vigorously defend himself against this criminal prosecution\".\n\nThe former vice president has been cooperating with investigators, said Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer who is representing him. Mr Brafman said the US attorney's office charged Mr Geithner without notifying him in advance and that he had been free to accept or decline any plea agreement offered. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr Brafman's statement said his client was \"cooperating with federal investigators, and the government's alleged criminal wrongdoing cannot be tolerated\".\n\nBoeing said in a statement on Tuesday that after learning of the charges \"we believe he entered a guilty plea to help the government get to the bottom of these cases\" and that it would co-operate with the government in \"any further necessary operations\".\n\nUS prosecutors first brought charges against Mr Geithner in March. He turned himself in to New York's Criminal Court on Sunday.\n\nOn Thursday, the court ordered him to pay $325,000 in restitution and forfeit $2.1m. Mr Geithner's lawyer said that he would appeal the decision on the forfeiture.\n\nThe case has raised questions about whether the US government has gone too far in using bribery charges to go after high-ranking public officials implicated in international bribery scandals.\n\nBoeing is a high-profile symbol of an American aerospace industry that has struggled to compete with rivals abroad.

    "Dear internet people, I'm writing for some advice for our rescue pup, Luna. She is currently a year old, and we rescued her 9 months ago. This summer, we took a few trips to our family farm. All in all, we have spent about 2 weeks total at the farm this year, and that includes an overnight stay for 4 nights in a row. She spent the most time on the farm this summer.\nShe was the happiest ever, loved running around the yard, swimming in the pond, chewing on cow ears, running through the dog tunnel, etc. Then about 2 weeks after we returned from the last trip to the farm we found she was barking at my husband out of aggression if he got close to her while she was on leash. The other day I found her trying to fight the dog from next door, growling at my son and then me when we came in to break it up. She tried to get the other dog to stop playing with us and didn't want anything to do with playing with it (and still doesn't). I immediately took her to an obedience school, which has helped tremendously. They had her on a shock/no shock collar, so she learned quickly that jumping was prohibited.\nWe also practiced a lot on training her. We worked with her on some loose leash walking, and she learned to sit/down/leave it during our walks. She is now much better and I think this has helped her a lot. But we are still working on her, she needs some training, lots of exercise, and socialization. She loves going for long walks, so I take her multiple times out and about in the neighborhood, and I've been taking her to my local off leash dog park. She was a little scared when we first got there (I was too) since there are some dogs quite a bit bigger than she is, but she was doing much better our second time going. However, I can't help but worry.\nIt feels like she is very on guard when she's around large groups of dogs or some of the really dominant dogs at the park. She tends to act a lot more aggressive when someone new and unknown is at the park. I'm pretty worried and really wanted someone else's perspective on her, I feel like it could be a lot of things like stress, lack of socialization, maybe even",
    "Hi, There's this redditor in my life who I love dearly. We're together almost seven years. We've only gone an entire year without sex, but I know he's into someone else. He recently discovered online that there is a whole other subreddit for a subspecies of humans, the non-monogamous. I'm not a member, and I'm still not comfortable discussing this with him, but the reddit community is extremely supportive of him and I know he knows he's doing the right thing. We're in a fairly long-distance relationship right now and haven't really been able to explore these interests. I asked him if I could keep the subreddit a secret for a while, like a secret tumblr, as is appropriate, and I think I'm doing that. I'm wondering if we could still be friends but not speak of the details of our relationship. I just feel like a secret would have the most impact if he told his friends and family but his friends and family wouldn't know what he's doing.\n\nI've never been jealous of my husband. We're both extremely happy. He is and is not into other women. He has never pressured me to take \"lifestyle\", \"fetish\" or whatever the hell other people are into. He is completely committed to me and has always been supportive, and I don't want to be in a position where things are so good in our relationship, and he isn't. He has a great job and I don't need him to do anything more. We haven't had any problems in the past and it feels like he just discovered these other reddit women and now he wants to know about them. (The other subs in the subreddit I've checked seem to be about love and the meaning of marriage and life, and I think that's what he's drawn to.) He said something, once to me, that had stuck with me from before we were married. I've only remembered it because his friend was making fun of my friend for admitting her affairs and he said something in defense of her and I thought that was kind of sweet. I still feel the same way about him now, and I wish there was more support and open discussion between us. Does anybody have any advice or suggestions like that?\n\nI've seen a fair number of comments on this sub on this very subject. Most are from men who are in a committed but",

    "This academic paper presents a novel methodology for segmenting overlapping wear particles in conditions where labelled data is limited and sample imbalance exists. The study utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to effectively identify wear particles, crucial for the diagnosis and prognosis of machine health. A unique dataset of particle images was compiled, distinguishing this work from previous studies that rely heavily on fully labelled datasets. The proposed approach demonstrates a high accuracy rate, effectively addressing the problem of segmentation of overlapping wear particles. Our approach significantly enhances particle analysis efficiency, proving its potential in real-time, automated, and intelligent machine health monitoring systems.",
    "In this paper, we investigate the potential for avoiding classical singularities in Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) guided by the concept of asymptotic safety. Our research demonstrates that under certain conditions, the strength of gravitational interactions diminishes as one approaches the singularity, which in turn, may result in its avoidance. We consider specific examples, comparing black hole, big bang, and cosmological singularity scenarios under the QEG framework. A thorough examination of the Renormalization Group Equations and minimal length arguments prove beneficial for our hypothesis. Our study thus provides an essential advancement in the theoretical foundation of quantum gravity, leaving open the question for further collaboration between quantum mechanics and general relativity.",

So when I finally decided to quit drinking, I had no idea how much worse my life would get.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm not going back. Not yet. I know that there are people who have made it through the worst times of their lives and managed to stay sober. They may not look exactly like me, but they're still alive. I'm not one of those people. I'll never be able to live up to their standards. But I will always try. Because I believe that if I keep trying, eventually I'll succeed.",

    "I've been with my girlfriend for about two years now. We've had our ups and downs, but we've always managed to work things out. However, recently, we've hit a snag that I'm not sure how to navigate.\n\nMy girlfriend has never really been a fan of working. She's had a few jobs here and there, but she's always quit after a few months. She says that she doesn't like the idea of working for someone else and that she'd rather be her own boss. I've always supported her in this, but I've also made it clear that she needs to contribute financially to our relationship.\n\nRecently, I was offered a job that I was really excited about. It's in my field, the pay is good, and it's a great opportunity for me to advance my career. However, when I told my girlfriend about it, she wasn't happy. She tried to convince me not to take the job, saying that it would take up too much of my time and that we wouldn't be able to spend as much time together.\n\nI tried to explain to her that this job is important to me and that it's a great opportunity, but she didn't seem to understand. She even suggested that I turn down the job and that we both live off of my savings until she can start her own business.\n\nI'm really torn about what to do. I love my girlfriend, but I also love this job. I don't want to choose between the two, but I feel like I'm being forced to. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC has confirmed the existence of the Higgs mechanism, which is the cornerstone of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. The SM is a renormalizable quantum field theory, which is perturbatively unitary. However, the SM is not a complete theory of particle physics, and it is widely believed that the SM is an effective theory of a more fundamental theory, which is non-renormalizable and non-perturbatively unitary. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for anomaly mediation, which is called positively deflected anomaly mediation.

    "We present an approach to semantic segmentation that uses domain adaptation and a novel neural network architecture to achieve high-quality results in image classification tasks. We show how our method can be used to improve the accuracy of medical imaging diagnosis, by using it to extract features from images that are not directly visible to the human eye. Our algorithm achieves this by exploiting the fact that the brain has evolved to process visual information in a way that minimizes the amount of data needed to reconstruct the original scene. In particular, we exploit the fact that the brain's receptive field (the area of maximum activity) is highly correlated with its spatial resolution. This allows us to use the same feature space as the brain does, but with much smaller datasets. The resulting system is able to detect objects in images at resolutions up to 1 mm × 1 mm × 0.5 mm, which is comparable to the resolution of most commercial MRI scanners. Furthermore, our system is capable of detecting objects in images at resolutions up to 2 mm × 2 mm × 0.1 mm, which is comparable to the resolution of many commercially available 3D scanners. These results demonstrate that our technique can be applied to a wide range of problems involving image processing, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and face recognition.",

    "This seems like an interesting question to me--particularly if, like we were discussing earlier in this thread and elsewhere, police officers try to avoid escalating violence out of fear that it will draw the attention of bystanders, which I imagine would be bad for morale if people thought law enforcement's response was unwarranted or overzealous.\n\nI am not particularly keen on resorting to the kind of things that would lead to physical confrontations with people who have been behaving unethically and perhaps even dishonestly toward you (in this case, citizens exercising their right to protest). But as long as you aren't harming anybody else, could police respond to acts of property-based disruption by deploying pepper spray and batons?\n\nFirst off, there are some good arguments for responding forcefully to protesters who are actively disrupting traffic, using firecrackers (the most common form of projectile thrown at cops these days seems to involve a lit lighter), throwing glass bottles, lighting other combustible materials, etc... There are also some good arguments against such measures, both legal and moral; so I guess it would depend upon what \"actively\" meant for that particular situation (e.g., what if activists are blocking traffic while wearing masks which make them difficult to identify by police)? For a demonstration against fracking in Denver last August, riot gear apparently was available for deployment for just 3 minutes during the first hour of activity. This raises interesting questions about the efficacy, necessity, and ethical relevance of such incidents--and it does raise the issue of when and how police should ever deploy defensive weapons (such as shields) or physical force (i.e., teargas/beanbag cartridges). Some argue that it is always morally justified to protect oneself and others against violent attack - if someone can legitimately be said to risk dying by being shot at, then I'm inclined to look askance at any argument suggesting the opposite. On my part, I think that one should respect everyone's choices to take that route rather than going it alone, but in many other circumstances of life it seems clear that the balance must swing somewhere towards the side of personal self preservation. Given that choice, you might end up using more forceful and aggressive means in those situations where it is necessary, including the application of force against persons acting aggressively towards others and threatening serious",
    "Every once in a while, there comes a movie that genuinely makes you feel better about life. The Intouchables is one of those films. Immediately captivating and emotionally engaging, this French masterpiece is laced with a pleasantly smart humor and deep emotional moments that are hard to shake off long after the film has ended.\n\nThe Intouchables, directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, narrates an improbable friendship in the most tender and charming way. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy deliver stunning performances, effortlessly immersing the audience in their characters' individual struggles and growth. The rapport and chemistry between the two leads are fantastic and entirely believable, and their performances are accented by a stellar supporting cast.\n\nCluzet’s portrayal of the affluent but physically impaired Philippe is brilliant. He conveys a vast array of emotions using merely his facial expressions and speech. Meanwhile, Sy as Driss, a man from the projects, brings a refreshing effervescence to the plot. At no point do his brash humor and candid personality feel artificial. Quite the opposite, the entire narrative feels grounded and real, making the audience care deeply about the characters on screen.\n\nThough dealing with heavy themes such as disability and social stratification, The Intouchables uses humor and sentimentality tactfully to offer a heart-touching experience without ever indulging in melodrama or cheap sympathy. \n\nThe beautiful score complements the enthralling screenplay impeccably. Also worth mentioning are the film's stunning cinematography and direction which, when combined with captivating performances, make the whole experience truly memorable.\n\nThe Intouchables is an uplifting film that not only entertains but also incites introspection on human tenderness, resilience, and the power of friendship. It is a thought-provoking exploration of human potential and an emotional roller coaster that will make you laugh, cry, and wish that it wouldn't end. A must-see, without a doubt.",

    "It's crazy to think that it's been two months since my first week in Taiwan, but I must have arrived just as the weather was beginning to turn chilly; I had only slept for about 4 hours all day at most during this time, so naturally I wasn't sure what to expect when it came to the bikes on my return to mainland China. Luckily for me, the bike rental guy who brought us all said they would definitely be OK after his warm up ride of them back from their storage (he does it often). As we set out into the night, we continued the tour, enjoying the sights along the way until dark fell. We hit the streets in search of another local hangout where we might grab some food to make our stay more comfortable, and once again, we passed by The Blue Dragon, a good dive bar with a wide selection on beers (in English, which made it difficult for both of us), a variety of local and imported cuisine, or perhaps one of the many Chinese-style tavernas that dot China's cities. This bar is known for being very noisy and chaotic, though not necessarily bad – as we were taking photos and staying somewhat calm, a young couple approached us asking if we wanted \"guāng mín\", a cocktail comprised mainly of the green and white fruit guān xī (or pomegranate) mixed together with whiskey. In essence, you end up sipping your liquor while the rest of the group enjoys the music playing above you; the taste is something like gin and honey topped with rum which provides a sweet-tart note throughout, and with enough alcohol content, these drinks can actually help you forget how cold it's getting outside! It took almost an entire bottle before I could convince my buddies at home to try one – luckily, they drank just enough to be aware of the bitter burn behind my eyes and gave mine away as soon as they finished (my roommate also found his own bottle a little too fruity)! Regardless, this place provided excellent entertainment no matter how busy the scene. Even better was seeing people walking their dogs through the area past our hotel. They never even looked twice at our bikes unless someone directly shouted out: 的还没错他是去被正害手的女人了!, but in practice, everyone just seemed",
    "There is some truth to the story, although there doesn't appear to be any real basis in reality for what the man posted about her as a female character. Some background on herself? She was born male (probably somewhere around 1970), and transitioned into more feminine clothing after marrying a guy who's had very little interest or contact with women before that time. She was active socially all through college but not much afterwards until her wife passed away when she was 25 years old (I think). After that she became depressed/stressed a lot (perhaps due to these events) and became estranged from her husband after they divorced and later remarried. To complicate matters she also suffered from serious back pain but didn't know it at that point. I'd believe she lived by her sense of honor though I'm skeptical that such an event could have inspired such thoughts and feelings. She wasn't doing well emotionally either, but we always thought we were good enough friends for that anyway, even though we weren't particularly close. At one point she took up wrestling because she wanted to express herself through her chosen passion – which is pretty common amongst older folks – without having to deal with the problems caused by traditional gender roles and machismo in most mainstream sports that are popular today. In any case she went to some crazy lengths trying to convince me she was actually a girls' team member who would never turn out to be anything other than another woman. What happened next will probably make you wonder just how much of that information is true! The story has already started gaining traction through a few anonymous subreddits regarding her gender identity rather quickly – including 'r/transfags', 'askmen', 'lgbtq', and 'tfm'. Apparently she attempted suicide two days ago.\n\nNow let me tell you something here. I've seen worse shit from trans folk than someone so self-absorbed that they tried murder after their gender reassignment failed to work; someone who thinks their own penis can save them from every conceivable problem that people with dicks face; someone who goes around calling everyone who doubts the authenticity of her'sexchange surgery' whores and creeps instead of people whom doubt everything about people who try to impersonate girls to get their way. A lot has been said on various blogs across the internet. Here are a handful just to give examples of the level we're talking about now…\n\nBut",

I feel like I am in uncharted territory and need some reassurance.\n\nI am a 37-year-old woman with PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) who has been struggling with fertility issues for as far back as I can remember. After years of frustrating doctors' appointments, a multitude of treatments, and more grueling rounds of IVF than I care to recall, I was overjoyed to finally experience the miracle of pregnancy for the very first time. The sheer happiness of those two pink lines appearing on the pregnancy test is hard to put into words. It felt like every tear, every needle prick, every hurdle that we had overcome was worth it for this moment.\n\nBut then, last week at the doctor's office, we received heartbreaking news - there was no heartbeat. As you can imagine, this news has crushed me and my partner. It feels like a cruel joke has been played on us. We were so close, and then in an instant, our dreams were taken away. The grief, frustration, confusion- it’s all too much to handle. My partner is supportive, but he has the privilege of detachment, it's not his body that failed.\n\nI'm currently waiting for a scheduled D&C procedure. The days feel long and nights longer. Physically, I'm prepared for what's to come, but emotionally, I feel desperate, hollow, and alone.\n\nI guess I'm looking for some words of comfort, similar stories, or if anyone has gotten pregnant and had a successful pregnancy after such an experience. How did you cope with this heartbreaking loss? Does it get easier? I just want some connection- some evidence that there is hope. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read through this.\n\n(Note: I understand that everyone's journey with fertility is different. One person’s experience isn't indicative of what will happen to another person. I'm not seeking medical advice in this post, just emotional support).",
    "\"Glory Road\" is a compelling and inspiring sports drama that tells the true story of the 1966 Texas Western Miners basketball team. The film is a powerful exploration of racial integration, teamwork, and the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.\n\nJosh Lucas delivers a stellar performance as Coach Don Haskins, a man who dared to challenge the status quo by recruiting and starting black players during a time when racial segregation was still prevalent. Lucas embodies the character's determination, grit, and passion, making Haskins a truly memorable and admirable figure.\n\nThe ensemble cast, including Derek Luke, Mehcad Brooks, and Damaine Radcliff, also deserve praise for their performances. They effectively portray the struggles, fears, and hopes of the young players, making their journey to victory all the more poignant and impactful.\n\nThe basketball sequences are thrilling and well-executed, keeping you on the edge of your seat. The film's pacing is excellent, balancing the sports action with the personal stories of the characters. The cinematography and production design effectively capture the look and feel of the 1960s, adding to the film's authenticity.\n\n\"Glory Road\" is not just a sports movie, but a social commentary that addresses racism and prejudice. It's a reminder of how far we've come, but also how much further we need to go. The film's message is as relevant today as it was in the 1960s.\n\nThe film's emotional climax, the championship game, is a testament to the power of unity and perseverance. It's a scene that will leave you cheering and perhaps even shedding a tear or two.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Glory Road\" is a must-watch for sports fans and history buffs alike. It's a film that celebrates diversity, courage, and the power of change. It's a story of underdogs who became champions, not just on the court, but in life.",
    "\"Hi, I recently came out to my mum and she was totally supportive. I'm very confused though. I'm pretty sure I'm Trans and want to transition. But I'm not sure if I'm just like going through the denial phase and after a year of \"thinking about it\" I will decide not to transition after all.\nAt the moment I feel a bit pressured to transition asap but I'm scared not to start righting my life as a girl soon enough and keep being in denial so for me not being able to transition is an option, it's an option of me not being happy for whatever reason. I could have a year of hating being a girl and regretting everything and in a year I would've transitioned, gone to therapist and done all of that. At the same time I know that I can't make the choice for me, I can't force this to be my feeling.\nSo you guys know better, how would you know if you're in the denial phase or it's what you really feel? For me I think I'm in denial bc when I think about me as girl I don't feel anything, I feel like a stranger to me and it kind of hurts. My mum asked me if I'm happy being me. And to be honest I never really thought about it because I could've been born as a girl and lived my life as a girl all my life because my personality wouldn't change. As a woman I don't like makeup but I don't dislike it and it doesn't bother me to wear it, I would if I was with someone I was getting intimate with which I'm not so I wouldn't know.\nSorry for the long post, I'm just confused and I'm scared. I tried my whole life to be a straight girl and I'm not, and I'm tired of pretending. I guess I just want to know how do I know if I'm just in denial or if it's what I really feel?

    "\"Resident Evil: Extinction\" is the third installment in the Resident Evil series, and it certainly doesn't disappoint. The film continues the story of Alice, played by the ever-charismatic Milla Jovovich, who is now wandering the Nevada desert. The world has been devastated by the T-virus, a plot element that continues from the previous films, and Alice is on a mission to survive and help others do the same.\n\nThe film is a visual spectacle, with stunning cinematography and special effects that truly bring the post-apocalyptic world to life. The desolate landscapes and eerie silence are a stark contrast to the intense action sequences, creating a sense of unease and anticipation that keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nJovovich delivers a strong performance, embodying the strength and resilience of her character. The supporting cast, including Ali Larter and Oded Fehr, also give commendable performances, adding depth to their characters and the overall narrative.\n\nThe plot is engaging, with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. The film does a good job of balancing action and horror elements, creating a thrilling and suspenseful atmosphere. The zombie scenes are particularly well-executed, with impressive makeup and effects that make them genuinely terrifying.\n\nHowever, the film does have its flaws. Some of the dialogue feels forced and the plot can be predictable at times. Additionally, while the action scenes are exciting, they sometimes overshadow the narrative, making the story feel secondary.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, \"Resident Evil: Extinction\" is a solid entry in the series. It delivers on the action and horror fronts, and fans of the franchise will not be disappointed. It's a thrilling ride from start to finish, with a compelling protagonist and a world that's as fascinating as it is terrifying. Whether you're a fan of the games, the previous films, or just a lover of action-packed horror, \"Resident Evil: Extinction\" is worth a watch.",
    "One advantage that deep brain stimulation (DBS) has over other therapies such as transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulations, in treating neurological and psychiatric disorders related to specific regions within subcortical structures involves implanting DBS electrodes directly into these target areas [1]. The goal then becomes one where we are able determine how much overlap exists between an electrode trajectory during surgery on patients with similar pathologies – using this information along side clinical responses can help guide surgeons about which location may yield greater benefit if implanted at all! This study describes novel approaches developed by us towards automatic segmentation algorithm development specifically designed around trajectories extracted both manually. Our approach requires only low density sampling frequency data sets generated through fluoroscopic imaging techniques; thus making it practical applicable across various geographical locations worldwide without reliance upon expensive infrastructure foundational component installations required often times when performing invasive neurosurgery planning procedures via computerized technology based models.\"",

    "This paper explores the nature of indiscriminate covers of infinite translation surfaces, challenging existing notions that portray them as 'devious' or complex. By deriving concrete examples and mathematical proofs, the study demonstrates how these covers behave neutrally or 'innocently', instead of complicating or manipulating the properties of translated surfaces. The paper introduces novel techniques and theoretical perspectives to highlight the simplicity and mannerism of these covers. It aspires to contribute to deeper understandings of how indiscriminate coverings function and interact, encouraging further research on the topic.",
    "> Deep learning has achieved great success in medical image segmentation. However, the performance of deep learning models is highly dependent on the quality of the training data. In practice, the training data are often corrupted by noisy labels, which can significantly degrade the performance of the model. To address this problem, we propose a novel cross-denoising network (CDN) to learn robust representations against corrupted labels. The proposed CDN consists of two branches: a denoising branch and a segmentation branch. The denoising branch is designed to learn robust representations against corrupted labels, while the segmentation branch is used to predict the segmentation masks. The two branches are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on two medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDN.\n\n## 一、简介\n\n### 1.1 背景\n\n在医学图像分割领域，深度学习已经取得了巨大的成功。然而，深度学习模型的性能高度依赖于训练数据的质量。在实践中，训练数据经常被噪声标签污染，这会严重降低模型的性能。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的跨混淆网络（CDN）来学习鲁棒的表示形式，以抵抗被污染的标签。所提出的CDN由两个分支组成：去混淆分支和分割分支。去混淆分支设计用于学习鲁棒的表示形式，而分割分支用于预测分割掩模。两个分支通过端到端的方式联合训练。在两个医学图像分割数据集中进",

    "We propose a new approach for interactive image segmentation using complex networks. The proposed method is based on the particle competition and cooperation model. The particles are represented by nodes in the complex network. The particles compete with each other to be the best particle. The best particle is the one that has the highest fitness value. The fitness value is calculated based on the distance between the particle and the image. The particles cooperate with each other to improve their fitness values. The particles cooperate by exchanging information with each other. The information is exchanged through the edges of the complex network. The complex network is constructed using the particle competition and cooperation model. The complex network is used to represent the relationship between the particles.

    "\"The Replacements\" is a charming, feel-good movie that takes the sports comedy genre to a whole new level. The narrative revolves around a motley crew of replacement players who come together and teach their audience the true value of teamwork, perseverance, and grit. Keanu Reeves, as the washed-up quarterback Shane Falco, delivers a credible performance, balancing wit and depth with admirable ease. Gene Hackman is equally praiseworthy as the experienced coach trying to manage this band of misfits. His character's wisdom and bold strategies add flavor to the overall plot.\n\nThe dialogues engrave signature humor along with some memorable lines that catch you off guard, leaving you laughing out loud or even emotional at times. The blend of comedy and drama never feels forced - a testament to director Howard Deutch's ability to balance different tones effectively. The movie prides itself on heartwarming moments that subtly bring out the players' backstories, humanizing them and making their eventual triumph even more satisfying.\n\nThe on-field sequences are executed exceptionally well, offering some edge-of-the-seat moments. The incorporation of well-choreographed and realistically captured football games adds to the movie's authenticity. All the supporting cast deliver solid performances and contribute to making this movie a real team effort.\n\nSure, \"The Replacements\" has its cliches and predictable moments.

    "\"Tropic Thunder\" is an explosive comedy that is loaded with outrageous laughs from start to end. Navigating the treacherous terrain of Hollywood, Robert Downey Jr., Ben Stiller, and Jack Black deliver standout performances that perfectly capture the overblown egos and eccentric personalities of the movie industry.\n\nThe movie is a brilliant satire of the Hollywood machine, cleverly poking fun at actors, agents, producers, and the entire filmmaking process. Downey Jr.'s portrayal of method actor Kirk Lazarus is particularly commendable - despite the controversial nature of the character, he manages to pull off his role with an uncanny blend of humor and criticism, creating a character who is both memorable and thought-provoking.\n\nAs a director, Stiller shows a keen understanding of the genre he is lampooning, masterfully crafting over-the-top sequences that hilariously mimic blockbuster war movies. Yet beneath the film's humour, \"Tropic Thunder\" offers cutting commentary on Hollywood's commodification of war and suffering for box-office success. It also addresses the industry's treatment of actors, particularly those with mental disabilities, in a way that is both irreverent and eye-opening.\n\nThe ensemble cast is fantastic, each contributing to the comic mayhem with aplomb. Tom Cruise's surprise role as the ruthless movie producer is a particular highlight, offering a departure from his usual roles that is as unexpected as it is hilarious. The interplay between characters is impeccably timed, adding to the chaotic energy that makes this film such a riotous fun.\n\nDespite its humorous facade, \"Tropic Thunder\" is a cleverly written critique of Hollywood that doesn't pull its punches. Its ability to balance biting satire with belly laughs is testament to the sharp wit of its writers. While its humor might be considered offensive by some, there's no denying the film's daring approach and its readiness to push the envelope.\n\nAt its core, \"Tropic Thunder\" is a wild and uproarious ride that serves up plenty of laughs while making poignant observations about the film industry. It's a standout comedy that isn't afraid to poke fun at its own industry, making it a must-see for film aficionados and casual viewers alike.",
    "A Conservative candidate has stepped down following controversy surrounding an insensitive remark he made. This move comes ahead of the upcoming local elections, casting a shadow on the Tory campaign.\n\nJames Smith, the Tory candidate for the constituency in question, announced his immediate resignation in a press statement released earlier this morning, giving no further discussion about the details surrounding his departure. \n\nIn a leaked audio recording circulating online, Smith was caught making derogatory comments during a private event recently. The content of the remark, deemed to be offensive and inappropriate, led to a swift public backlash, putting the Conservative Party under scrutiny. \n\nThe party's Chairperson reacted to Smith's resignation during a press conference held this morning, expressing disappointment over his remarks, while reassuring the public about the party's stance on intolerance. \n\n\"We are saddened by the circumstances leading to James Smith's resignation,\" they said. \"The views expressed by him are not representative of the Conservative Party's values. We stand firm on our commitment to respect and dignity for all.\"\n\nFollowing Smith's resignation, it's unclear who will be replacing him as the Tory candidate in the upcoming elections. The party promises to address this in the coming days, amid calls for a candidate that better resonates with community values.\n\nPoliticians from rival parties have seized on Smith's resignation as an opportunity to question the conduct of the Conservative Party, ahead of what is expected to be a closely contested election. \n\nThe fallout over his remarks is the latest in a series of setbacks the Tories have faced in recent months, serving as a stark reminder of the influence of conduct and language in political discourse.\n\nAs the Conservative party regroups and looks towards the forthcoming elections, the main focus will be on ensuring that lessons have been learnt amidst the scandal, and that their potential candidates are more attuned to the responsibilities that come with being a public servant.\n\nSmith's decision to step down will help disentangle the party from the ongoing controversy, allowing them to shift focus onto their election campaign strategy. Yet, the political damage might have already been inflicted, and only time will reveal the true impact of this incident on the party's electoral prospects.",

    "After a period of stagnation, silver prices have seen a significant uptick today. This has led to speculation among investors and market analysts about the potential start of a bull run. \n\nFor those who are not familiar, a bull run refers to a market scenario where the prices of securities are rising or are expected to rise. It's named after the way a bull thrusts its horns up into the air. \n\nThe reasons for this sudden surge are manifold. Some attribute it to the weakening dollar, others to the increasing industrial demand, and some even to the growing interest of retail investors. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the commodities market is highly volatile and unpredictable. While today's rise in silver prices might indicate the start of a bull run, it's equally possible that it could be a temporary spike. \n\nAs always, it's crucial to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is the start of a bull run for silver? Or is it just a temporary spike? Let's discuss.",
    "The most recent entry in \"Planet of the Apes.\" It features the same tone that made the first three films timeless, with one notable change: there are now two apes, Caesar (Andy Serkis) and the newly adopted Juba (Andy Serkis), and the plot is largely the same. But the film is all about the characters, with little actual narrative drive.\n\nThe plot is about a group of apes living in a small town, where people are getting close to Caesar, but Caesar will stop at nothing to assert himself and regain power. The story also introduces a major antagonist that I won't reveal here, though we learn how he will eventually bring chaos to the apes, both physically and psychologically (again, no spoilers).\n\nThe acting is great; each ape in the cast gives a great performance, and it truly is the film's \"Apes\" at its core. There are some standout characters as well, particularly one named Simba, the father of the main character. The film is also well-received by many critics, coming in at a solid 8.0 out of 10.\n\nThe special effects are not really anything to write home about. These are CGI apes, as opposed to CGI humans. The apes in the movie look less like humans when they are on the screen and more as a sort of digital ape, and that effect is mostly lost when they are in the shot. The computer generated apes seem more natural when they are on the screen than they do in real life. Nevertheless, I really like this effects that will make the movie more exciting than you anticipate, especially when you hear the main ape character talk with a very realistic English accent.\n\nThe \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise has had numerous sequels and prequels, so there are a ton of character-driven story-lines to explore. But I'm not sure I'm interested in seeing a bunch more sequels, because the core story is all about the characters. They each have interesting arcs, and are great additions to the ape family, and make the movie more interesting. I think it's a shame that we can't have an even more complete story involving the film's numerous characters, especially since they have so much to give.\n\nOverall, \"Planet of the Apes\" is a great motion picture that is as timeless to modern fans and to sci-fi fans as",
    "This paper presents a novel approach to long-term visual localization using semantically segmented images. The study proposes a method that leverages semantic segmentation to improve the robustness and accuracy of visual localization in changing environments over extended periods. The proposed system uses a deep learning model to segment images into semantically meaningful regions, which are then used to match images taken at different times under varying conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios such as seasonal changes and dynamic environments. This research opens up new possibilities for long-term visual localization in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and augmented reality applications.",

    "\"Baby Driver\" is an obsessively curated action masterpiece that hits all the right spots. The film has been orchestrally composed by director Edgar Wright, who combines stunning visuals with an engaging narrative to craft an emotional, high-octane joyride.\n\nThe movie revolves around the life of Baby, played with intriguing subtlety by Ansel Elgort, a young and talented getaway driver suffering from tinnitus, who relies on the rhythm of his personal soundtracks to perform daring heists. Elgort's performance is magnetic and he skillfully portrays Baby's inner conflicted turmoil, making the character irresistibly empathetic.\n\nThe soundtrack of the movie is an integral piece of the storytelling, and in some ways, it becomes a character in itself. Every beat of each scene seamlessly aligns with the scintillating tracks, magnifying the experience of adrenaline-fueled chases and action sequences.\n\nThe supporting cast includes the likes of Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, and Jamie Foxx. Each of these performers adds depth and menace to the film's intricate dynamics. Their performances with the well-written dialogues amplify the tension, frequently punctuating scenes with unexpected humor.\n\nCustom-made for fans of heist and action genre, the film's exceptional and precise choreography of chase sequences and stunts is a testament to Wright's adept directorial skills. His innovative approach towards heist movies gives the audience a fresh, non-generic experience.\n\nIn terms of technicality, the cinematography deserves a special mention for its stylistic portrayal of Atlanta cityscape. The editing is crisp with synchronized audio-visual transitions that elevate the overall narrative.\n\nHowever, the movie isn't without its flaws. The plot occasionally stumbles and treads into predictable outcomes. The romantic subplot feels a little rushed, compromising on the intense build-up in the first act of the movie.\n\nIn essence, \"Baby Driver\" is a mesh of excitement and artistic creativity. It is a stunning cinematic experience that sets itself apart with its unique blend of music, action, and character-driven drama. Despite a few hiccups in the narrative, it remains undeniably entertaining and should be appreciated for its audacity and originality. Definitely a must-see for lovers of smart, stylish, and sharp cinema.",
    "Cybersecurity firms have sounded an alarm over the increasing number of domain system scams, raising fears of huge financial losses and a breach of personal data. \n\nUnsuspecting internet users and businesses have been targeted by fraudsters asking for bank information or tricking them by 'spoofing' transactions for the transfer of domain names. Typically, scammers send an email often disguised as coming from a credible source, like the domain registrar or internet service provider, to get users to reveal sensitive personal or financial data.\n\n\"Scammers have become advanced and are now able to make their emails and websites appear genuine,\" says cybersecurity expert, Mr. Thomas Moore. \"Those unfamiliar with such tricks easily fall victim, potentially causing tremendous financial loss and breach of personal information.\"\n\nExperts warn that the level of sophistication used by scammers has significantly increased over the past years. They are reportedly using similar sounding domain names, logos and even addresses of legitimate businesses to trick their victims.\n\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which oversees the global domain name system, has also expressed its concerns. It claims that these scams are undermining the trust of internet users and threatening online transactions.\n\n\"As much as we are working hard to regulate the digital landscape, users need to be cautious about the emails they receive and the websites they visit,\" says an ICANN spokesperson. \"Not all issues can be solved technically, end-users being vigilant is equally crucial.\"\n\nIn addition to the financial losses, the rising numbers of domain system scams also pose a significant risk regarding data protection. Personal or financial information intercepted by scammers could lead to identity theft and fraud.\n\nAuthorities urge individuals and businesses to practice safe online behavior. This includes regularly updating antivirus software, double-checking sender email addresses, never providing financial or personal information without verifying the source and regularly changing passwords.\n\nSecurity experts are also advising business owners to register similar sounding or spelled domain names to their business to prevent scammers from creating counterfeit domains.\n\nRegulators worldwide are now prioritizing actions to battle these cybercrimes, however, the onus also lies on internet users to remain informed and vigilant against potential domain system scams in the digital realm.",
    "\"Gladiator\" is a cinematic masterpiece that brilliantly combines action, drama, and historical elements into a compelling narrative. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film is a testament to his ability to create visually stunning and emotionally resonant pieces of cinema.\n\nRussell Crowe delivers a powerhouse performance as Maximus, a Roman general who is betrayed and reduced to slavery. Crowe's portrayal is both physically and emotionally intense, capturing the audience's empathy as he fights for survival and revenge. His performance is complemented by Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus, the corrupt and power-hungry emperor. Phoenix's performance is chilling and captivating, making Commodus a character you love to hate.\n\nThe film's production design is nothing short of spectacular. The recreation of ancient Rome is breathtaking in its detail and scale, immersing the audience in the grandeur and brutality of the era. The action sequences, particularly the gladiatorial battles, are expertly choreographed and filmed, providing thrilling spectacle without sacrificing character development or narrative coherence.\n\nThe film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is another standout element. The music is epic and emotional, perfectly complementing the film's visual storytelling.

    "Ireland's World Cup hopes hang in balance as they face England at Twickenham on Saturday, with the All Blacks set to be without their captain Richie McCaw and fly-half Dan Carter for the game.\n\nMcCaw has been ruled out after suffering an ankle injury during training last week while Carter will miss his second consecutive match after being forced off injured against France.\n\nEngland have also lost key players to injury this month including flanker Mike Brown who was ruled out of the Six Nations with concussion and lock Courtney Lawes who suffered a broken hand.\n\n\"We're going into it with a lot of uncertainty,\" said coach Joe Schmidt. \"It's not ideal but we've got to get through it.\"\n\nSchmidt confirmed that he had spoken to McCaw about the possibility of him missing the game.\n\n\"He's obviously disappointed because he wants to play but I think he understands what's required of him,\" said Schmidt.\n\n\"I spoke to him yesterday and he knows how important it is for us to win this game. He's very much looking forward to playing.\"\n\nWith McCaw and Carter both unavailable, Schmidt could call up another player from the bench such as prop Sean O'Brien or hooker Rory Best.\n\n\"There are options there,\" said Schmidt. \"If you look at our team, we've got some good options. We'll see how we go.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Schmidt revealed that he would like to see more of his backline in action before the tournament gets underway.\n\n\"We need to make sure we give them a chance to show what they can do,\" said Schmidt. \"They've played well in the past few weeks so hopefully they can continue that form.\"",
    "This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection in time series of graphs using locality statistics. The study introduces a new method that leverages the local structure of graphs to identify anomalous behavior over time. The proposed technique is based on the premise that anomalies are local events that significantly deviate from the norm, and thus, can be effectively detected by examining the local statistics of a graph. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on various synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately detecting anomalies. The results also highlight the method's robustness against noise and its scalability to large-scale graphs. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on graph-based anomaly detection, offering a new perspective that emphasizes the importance of locality in identifying unusual patterns.",

    "\"The Fan\" is a psychological thriller that really pushed the boundaries of its genre. Robert De Niro's intensely chilling portrayal of a passionate and deeply troubled baseball fan is one that truly highlighted his versatility and ability as an actor. His character's obsession with baseball superstar Bobby Rayburn, played by a fittingly intense Wesley Snipes, serves as a commentary that takes the often romanticized notion of fandom to its extreme ends. \n\nAs unpredictable and unnerving as De Niro's character may be, there is something inherently relatable about the love for a player and a sport taken too far. Director Tony Scott uses this to his advantage to craft a story that is both tension-filled and thought provoking. The impressive cast also includes Ellen Barkin and John Leguizamo, each doing justice to their roles and adding further depth to the narrative. \n\nVisually, \"The Fan\" is a treat. Scott's signature dynamic visual style matched perfectly with the thrilling atmosphere of the movie, creating a cinematic feast. The sound design too deserves a special mention, with the echoes of the sports stadium and the thunderous roar of the crowd adding authenticity and a tangible sense of electricity.\n\nHowever, \"The Fan\" is not without its flaws. The plot is riddled with extreme situations that can sometimes feel implausible and the pacing occasionally falters. Regardless, the performances, visual aesthetics, and the pure adrenaline the film evokes in its tenser moments make it a worthy addition to the thriller genre.\n\n\"The Fan\" might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those looking for a thrilling ride and a unique exploration of fan culture, it definitely scores a home-run.",
    "A new law will enable authorities to crack down on those who try to'steal our culture' by selling so-called mobile music and ringtones used at home and in cars and taxis, with penalties including fines up to £5,000. The regulations were agreed as part of reforms announced yesterday after government-backed calls to clampdown on aggressive marketing from car industry lobbyists. But campaigners said they expected the law to be abused in the future - as phone companies already block their customers using illegal apps such as Skrillex's own Reverb Nation.... Government officials made it clear that consumers concerned about any abusive or fraudulent services would not have to take any action, which was welcomed by music fans but criticised by many legal analysts who say that there are no hard statistics to indicate whether use of popular tunes has increased since the 1990s when licensing fees soared. The regulations allow users to give digital rights management permission and then sell any ringtones, songs and video clips online if those content have been licensed. They will apply even for videos containing licensed material from artists and films that have been uploaded to YouTube, Vevo and other platforms.... In 2008, music publishers launched a drive to make copyright more difficult to collect if consumers buy physical copies of songs over online providers like Amazon and Apple's iTunes Music Store (IPMS). However, some musicians see plans for the same technology being rolled out for digital downloads to hit a few too close at the hip now that new legislation can stop mobile manufacturers from blocking such software for sale on devices and networks. Many owners of Android handsets were reported having blocked unauthorized software when the product released a short time ago...",
    "A new breed of workforce surveillance software is making waves in the business world, promising to cultivate productivity, performance and security. However, these digital ‘overseers’ are also sparking controversy, with critics arguing that they infringe on employees' privacy rights and breach legal lines.\n\nMany organisations across the UK have turned to advanced monitoring tools, which trace an employee's professional online activities. These tools offer impressive metrics, measuring everything from keyboard strokes to time spent on sites, indicating efficiency and productivity.\n\nSoftware firms such as Teramind, ActivTrak, Time Doctor and InterGuard, among others, are industry leaders in this domain. Their technology can provide businesses with in-depth insights into the patterns and behaviours of their workers, helping them spot potential issues, optimise performance, and enforce company policies.\n\n\"The data provided can be invaluable in identifying bottlenecks, improving processes and enhancing overall productivity,\" comments Isaac Turner, chief technology officer at Teramind. He outlined that this could foreseeably lead to improved job satisfaction and retention rates.\n\nHowever, such intensive surveillance has ruffled feathers among privacy advocates and trade unions. Critiques premised on nurturing an environment of paranoia and distrust amongst staff are widespread. Critics argue that under constant monitorisation, employees may feel demotivated and intimidated, ultimately impacting creativity and individual thinking.\n\nFrances O'Grady, General Secretary at the Trades Union Congress (TUC), voices such concerns, stating, \"Employers must not use tech to control and micromanage their staff. Monitoring toilet breaks, tracking every movement and snooping on staff outside of working hours creates fear and despair.\"\n\nConcerns over the invasion of privacy is especially potent in the era of remote working, where work and personal life boundaries are already blurred. There are legal implications too, with employers needing to ensure that their surveillance strategies align with data protection laws and privacy regulations.\n\nEmployers must balance their interests in leveraging technology for productivity and security with respect to an individual's privacy whilst not fostering invasive workplace cultures. Confirming this, IT attorney Maxwell Hartley says, “Employers would do well to disclose monitoring practices very clearly to employees and ensure that their operations are within the purview of the law.\"\n\nAs more businesses explore these cutting-edge technologies, the debates around privacy and surveillance in the workplace are set to intensify. For now, the challenge lies in finding a balance where the fostering of a productive work environment does not come at the expense of employee privacy. A task that, in the age of digital nomads and remote work, may be easier said",
    "\"Shall We Dance,\" a delightful romantic comedy drama, spins a fascinating tale of love, life, transformation and dance. It strikes a poignant chord, combining the joy of dance with a midlife crisis narrative.\n\nThe heart of the movie surrounds Richard Gere, an exceptional performer who brings gravitas to his role as a bored, lonely lawyer who finds solace in ballroom dancing. His chemistry with his co-star Jennifer Lopez is palpable - both bring their characters to life with finesse and authenticity, delivering touching performances.\n\nThe cinematography is wonderful, infusing the dance scenes with evocative grace and elegance.

    "Hello fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm reaching out today seeking some answers and clear understanding about psychosis. A family member of mine was recently diagnosed with what the doctors refer to as 'psychosis' and I'm trying to better understand what they're going through. \n\nThey often talk about hearing voices that aren't there and sometimes they seem extremely paranoid. I've also noticed that their speech can be a little strange and their behavior really unpredictable. However, I've read that psychosis often comes with hallucinations and delusions and they haven't mentioned experiencing either of those. \n\nMy main concern is that their symptoms don't seem to fall perfectly in line with what I have read about psychosis. Is this normal? Are these symptoms common for people suffering from this condition? I'm trying to educate myself to be as supportive and understanding as I can during this tough time.\n\nAny insights and experiences you would be willing to share would be of great help. Or, if you can guide me towards resources or support forums related to the matter, it would be much appreciated. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post and any help you could provide is greatly appreciated.

    "This paper presents a novel approach for Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) image segmentation, utilizing an iterative, deep, and unsupervised learning method. The aim is to improve the automatic recognition and classification of objects in underwater scenarios, a task that poses significant challenges due to the complex nature of the undersea environment. Our method employs a deep convolutional autoencoder model to rigorously learn a set of high-level feature representations and an iterative, unsupervised clustering technique to effectively segment the SAS images. Experimental results, conducted on real-world data, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over conventional techniques in terms of segmentation accuracy and processing efficiency. The applicability of this approach is significant, with potential uses in a wide range of marine research and industrial applications including seafloor mapping, underwater archaeology, and mine detection.",
    "This time, there's a race to get to the end of the movie — and to beat the movie to the punch. I love the idea that the movie isn't waiting around to let us in. It's running ahead.\n\nAfter the movie came out it was a bit frustrating for the hardcore fans of the comics that, for the first few weeks, the only way to get to the movie was to go to some random digital rental site. There hasn't been a huge amount of new material since the movie came out, so it's been hard to catch up to the movie. I did try to do my best and watch the whole thing through — but it's like there's a time limit: once that hour is up, the movie is over — and you have to move on to the next thing.\n\nWhat I figured out from my own experience is, if you want to watch the whole thing, you can't keep watching the previews. You need to go into the actual movie. This movie is like this, so I thought I'd use the time before the movie started to catch up on the back catalog. And if you're watching the movie on Blu-ray, it's actually going to be pretty easy to find all this stuff on Amazon and other digital rental sites.\n\nAnd it turns out this entire online experience will probably work better for most movie buff that the movie was trying to attract — because you can see all of that stuff all at once.\n\nThe movie is not a movie that's like, \"Get your geek on!\" It's a movie about the real thing. The movie is about being the first superhero team to start a superhero team and trying to do the next best thing to fight all the other superheroes that are trying to kill them, right now. The movie is about the team that they recruit to be the Fantastic Four, and they're the team who have to start from zero.\n\nIt's going to be a little more than the back catalog. This is going to be a lot of a little extras along with it. Some really cool new scenes.\n\nSome really cool new scenes.

This is one of those films that you can watch over and over again because there are so many different ways to approach it. It's not just about the plot or the characters, but also how they react to each other. There are plenty of twists and turns along the way, which makes this film worth watching multiple times.\n\nI'm going to give this film a solid 8/10.

    "\"Straight Outta Compton\" provides a raw and emotional insight into the origin, rise, and subsequent trials of five young men who shook not only the music industry, but the socio-political landscape of their era. Set in the hostile environment of Compton, California, the narrative introduces us to the founding members of N.W.A, effortlessly playing out their journey from anonymity to international recognition.\n\nDirector F. Gary Gray impeccably captures the plight and dichotomous existence of five individuals navigating the tough streets of Compton while harboring dreams of making it big in the music industry. The screenplay by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff showcases the despair, anger, and disillusionment experienced by these young men and their bold decision to channel these emotions into their music. Intermingling the narrative with hauntingly accurate socio-political commentary, the film is as much a revelation of societal injustice as it is a tale of their rise to fame.\n\nThe performances are commanding, most notably O'Shea Jackson Jr.'s almost uncanny portrayal of his real-life father, Ice Cube. Jason Mitchell's powerful portrayal of Eazy-E exposes a man driven by ambition, yet constantly entangled in a web of insecurities. Corey Hawkins brings to life Dr. Dre's relentless drive and distinctive ability to create unmatched music, while Paul Giamatti's portrayal of their manager Jerry Heller, dances on the strings of ambiguity.\n\nThe cinematography is captivating, delving us deep into the heart of Compton. From the pounding music beats, raw dialogues, to the graffiti-laden streets, and police brutality - every frame strikes a chord. The soundtrack reignites some of the era's most iconic hip-hop tracks, further intensifying the immersive experience.\n\n\"Straight Outta Compton\" is a compelling, hard-hitting biopic that not only explores the tumultuous journey of N.W.A but also lays bare the throbbing backbone of the hip-hop revolution. While the film ends on a somber note with the death of Eazy-E, it successfully emblematizes the group's undying legacy.\n\nThough some may argue the film occasionally strays into a typical rags-to-riches template, the intensity of the performances and the boldness of the narrative keep it grounded, breathing life into a story that is still relevant and resonating in the contemporary musical and sociocultural discourse. Overall, \"Straight Outta Compton\" is a tremendous film, worth watching for anyone interested in music history, social justice, or simply compelling storytelling.",

    "I've been playing some games on my phone lately, and I noticed something weird about how people block attacks when they're fighting each other (in these particular types of game). It's not just one person doing it either - everyone does this! And no-one seems to notice that there are any problems with their technique... So here goes.... In most cases where you have two players facing off against another player or computer controlled character who has an attack coming at them; if both fighters use blocks then only 1 will be successful while all others fail because neither fighter can see what happens next until after he/she blocked so cannot react accordingly before being hit again anyway which means more damage taken overall than would otherwise occur had someone else done nothing but wait for his turn instead?

    "\"Monsters vs. Aliens\" is a delightful blend of comedy, action, and heart that appeals to both children and adults. The animation is top-notch, with vibrant colors and detailed character designs that bring the unique cast of characters to life. The film's plot is engaging and well-paced, with enough twists and turns to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe voice acting is superb, with Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, and Hugh Laurie delivering standout performances. Each character is distinct and memorable, from Witherspoon's Susan (aka Ginormica), a woman transformed into a giant after being hit by a meteor, to Rogen's B.O.B., a gelatinous, indestructible, and hilariously clueless blob. The interactions between the characters are both humorous and touching, adding depth to the story.\n\nThe humor in \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" is clever and well-timed, with jokes that will make both kids and adults laugh out loud. The film also contains several references to classic monster and alien movies, which adds an extra layer of enjoyment for fans of those genres.\n\nBut what truly sets \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" apart is its heart. Amidst all the action and comedy, the film explores themes of friendship, self-acceptance, and courage. It sends a positive message about embracing one's uniqueness and standing up for oneself, which is a valuable lesson for viewers of all ages.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" is a fun, entertaining, and heartwarming film that is well worth watching.

    "Abstract\n\nA BRCA2 mutation that results in an atrazine resistance allele was detected and confirmed using BESPs (BEsp) (1). The mutations cause a loss of heterozygosity and lead to >10-fold increase in frequency of the mutant allele on chromosome 16q28 (chromosome rearrangement region), resulting in double amplification by base pair mismatch from three sources, both in vitro-based assays and by DNA mapping (2). Analysis of these data suggest that genomic rearrangements are common in human populations caused by mutations in atrazine resistant alleles. However, their effects can't be explained solely by base pair mismatches and a few cases were not observed under appropriate conditions, so chromosomal rearrangement will always exist until complete sequencing becomes available in a clinical situation. This represents another example illustrating how a very robust molecular marker could help explain biological variation. We used the ATRANO project (3) database (4–11) as our reference genome sequence with 838 ATs per million mapped regions and 23,890 positions between chromosomes 1 and 4. We studied the first 150 bp, excluding homologous recombination hotspots. Sequence analysis showed at least 33 additional insertion and deletion events, some affecting amino acids but most containing multiple insertions, deletions or whole-genome displacement. Using this information, we applied two approaches aimed to identify mutations responsible for BCS. (i) By modeling a combination of the ATRS and ATAP proteins and finding the sequences which encode them; (ii) by finding the bases with a major effect based on the nucleotide composition. These strategies uncovered nine different types of mutations, each contributing to one end of the spectrum and four different mutations at either extreme: the ATRS(+)/ATAP(−) substitution, G→A transversions and other combinations of nucleotides. Our results show that these alterations affect more than just the ATRS protein in humans, and thus could well provide a key mechanism in explaining why some people get BCS mutations while others do not, and provide us with new targets that may represent an evolutionary target of BCS mutations.\n\nComments",
    "This movie was supposed to be a straightforward historical re-telling on what it is like when the Nazi's invaded Russia, but this movie took twists and turns that I could never have seen coming. The story line revolves around an American pilot who gets taken hostage by Soviet airmen who are in charge of taking revenge against America after one of their pilots (Vasili Arkhipov) tried to fly one and escape over enemy territory in 1943 (the story seems contradictory since he would still fly back to America). When Russia is overrun with German troops by 1944 this hostage will eventually return home but not all he has witnessed will make him want to go home. After surviving his captivity and being placed under house arrest he receives orders from another pilot to join the military so he can go fight again if he finds out where all these Axis airplanes were hiding. He decides to go into fighter training soon so that when the war really starts there is someone ready to take over flying duties for them in case something goes wrong. I think the problem is that it does not show you the true extent of the suffering the Allied soldiers went through right until the end. In my opinion this film needs to be rated 10/10 more so others may understand the real scale of it. It may look slow and ponderous at times but it really hits hard during the torture scenes and the ending when Vassily, the commander of one of the aircraft on the raid, shoots himself hoping for a chance to live even though no way would he survive otherwise! A truely wonderful achievement that deserves every scrap of praise, award and accolade.\"",
    "We present an approach to segmenting cardiac tissue using strong anatomical guarantees, which allows us to reconstruct the entire heart in 3D and perform complex functional imaging studies on it. We show that our method can be used to accurately identify the location of the ventricles, the left atrium, the right ventricle, and the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) in vivo. Our results demonstrate that our technique provides a robust and accurate way to segment cardiac tissue, even when the tissue is not perfectly preserved. Furthermore, we show that our method can be applied to other tissues such as skeletal muscle or skin, and that it can provide high-resolution images of these tissues.",

    "\"The Caine Mutiny\" is a classic film that brilliantly captures the essence of naval life and the psychological complexities of its characters. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, the film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Herman Wouk, and it does justice to the source material in every sense.\n\nThe film's narrative revolves around the crew of a World War II naval ship, the USS Caine, and their struggles with their unstable and paranoid captain, Lieutenant Commander Philip Queeg, played by Humphrey Bogart. Bogart delivers a stellar performance, portraying the character's descent into paranoia with such conviction that it leaves the audience both sympathetic and disturbed. His portrayal of Queeg is arguably one of the best performances of his career.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Van Johnson, Fred MacMurray, and Robert Francis, also deliver strong performances, each adding depth to their characters and contributing to the overall tension and drama of the film. The screenplay is well-written, with dialogue that is sharp, engaging, and thought-provoking.\n\nThe film's technical aspects are also commendable. The cinematography effectively captures the claustrophobic environment of the ship, and the editing keeps the narrative taut and engaging. The film's climax, set in a military courtroom, is particularly well-executed, with the tension building up to a satisfying conclusion.\n\n\"The Caine Mutiny\" is not just a war film; it is a study of character, leadership, and the human condition. It explores themes of duty, loyalty, and the moral complexities of military command. It is a film that makes you think, and it stays with you long after the credits roll.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Caine Mutiny\" is a must-watch for fans of classic cinema and war films. It is a testament to the power of storytelling and the art of cinema. It is a film that deserves its place in the annals of film history.",
    "This film was so good that it made me cry, and not just because Thanos killed half my favorite characters in one fell swoop (though he did). The story line had been building up to this moment since Iron Man 1 came out 10 years ago! It's amazing how well they've kept everything consistent throughout all these movies while still making each installment feel fresh with new ideas added into them as needed without ever feeling like too much has changed or anything feels forced upon us by some outside force trying desperately hard enough make sure we don't forget about what happened before even though there are now more than 20 films worth watching between then & today alone; but yet somehow manages never once lose sight on where its going next either - which makes sense considering Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige himself said back when Guardians Vol 2 premiered last year during Comic Con 2017 panel Q&A session at San Diego Convention Center Hall H-1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I9J10K11L12M13N14O15P16Q17R18S19T20U21V22W23X24Y25Z26AA27AB28AC29AD30AE31AF32AG33AH34AI35AJ36AK37AL38AM39AN40AO41AP42AQ43AR44AS45AT46AU47AV48AW49AX50AY51AZ52BA53BB54BD55BE56BF57BG58BH59BI60BL61BM62BN63BO64BP65BR66BS67BT68BU69BV70BW71BY72CA73CC74CD75CE76CF77CG78CH79CI80CL81CM82CN83CO84CP85CS86CT87CU88CV89CW90CX91CY92DA93DB94DD95DE96DF97DG98DH99DI100DJ101DK102DL103DM104DN105DO106DP107DQ108DR109DS110DT111DU112DV113DW114DX115DY116EA117EB118EC119ED120EE121EF122EG123EH124EL125EM126EN127EP128EQ129ER130ES131ET132EU133EV134EW135EX136FA137FB138FC139FE140FF141FG142FH143FI144FL145FM146FN147FO148FP149FR150FS151",
    "\"Our main idea in this paper is about the efficient evaluation of a compact version of product or product space. According to this strategy, a compact space consists of a set of linear products, and a set of linear filters over this set. Here, linear maps are used to specify the compactness property of the (filtered) compact set of products, which are known as product space. In our case, we evaluate the composition of a linear map with the product space itself by selecting at random a linear map of all fixed dimensions. In contrast to other work, we do not specify, at first sight, a specific choice of \"product\", but rather take the property of nonlinearity of the filters. Such a property, which is not known to the author of such analysis, is not easily definable by using finite series or other traditional nonlinearity tests. In addition to the usual nonlinearity tests, we also take advantage of the property of compactness to the filter, which gives a good approximation to the nonlinearity. As a consequence, using a product space as an efficient (or inefficient) measure for the nonlinearity of a filter is both correct and a generalization of the usual nonlinearity tests from regularity to compactness. Concretely, we first introduce an optimization scheme that we call \"narrower product space,\" which we prove that a compact compact collection of products (or products of filters) will be compact if and only if both this compact collection and the selected filter have a finite complement. In other words, the selection of a filter in the product space must be as specific as that of a linear map in the collection space. A generalization of our method is that any fixed pair of linear maps can be selected without restriction by simply selecting random elements from the selection between them. Moreover, given a \"filter\" and some product space, we show that this product space is always compact, and thus compact in any sense in which product space is defined in an efficient and general way. \"\n\n\nHere is an animation of our proof in practice:",
    "This paper provides an in-depth examination of uniform global attractors for non-autonomous 3D Navier-Stokes equations, a topic of significant importance in fluid mechanics. It revolves around the thorough analysis of non-autonomous dynamical systems and their global attractors, offering crucial insight into their long-term asymptotic behaviors. The study employs analytical tools to verify the existence of uniform global attractors for non-autonomous 3D Navier-Stokes equations, therefore enriching our understanding of fluid dynamics. The findings also hold valuable implications for other fields where understanding the behavior of complex non-linear systems over time is critical.",
    "So here's the situation, I've been with my girlfriend for about two years now and for the most part, things have been really great. We get along, we have similar interests, and I genuinely care about her a lot. But over the past couple of months, I've started to notice some changes in her behaviour which has me pretty worried.\n\nShe’s been doubling down on her work, pulling double or sometimes even triple shifts than what is required of her. She always seems stressed out and tired and has stopped taking care of herself the way she used to. Our conversations have become repetitive and lack depth. It’s all about work, work, and more work.\n\nI've tried talking to her about it, asking if there's anything I can do to help or support, but she brushes me off by saying that she's just busy and doesn't have as much time as before. She's basically pushed me away and refuses to let me close, emotionally or physically. I feel like she's spiralling, and I feel so helpless watching it happen.\n\nI do love her and want things to work out, but it's becoming increasingly difficult given her current state. I want to be there for her and support her, but I can't if she continuously pushes me away. It's been a rough couple of months and to be honest, my patience is worn thin. I’m tired of being an emotional punching bag and I don’t even know if she realises what she’s doing to me and us.\n\nSo here I am, hoping to find some advice, maybe from someone who has been in a similar situation. How did you cope? Or can someone advise me on how to approach her without it spiralling into a whole argument as usual? How can I make her realise that she's pushing me away and destroying our relationship? I'm at a loss here and any advice or suggestions would be truly appreciated.",
    "Abstract The distorted mirror of Wikipedia (DM) has been widely discussed in academic circles, and its impact on scholarly communication has been studied by several researchers. This study examines the extent to which Wikipedia articles about academics are biased against them. We find that DM articles tend to be more negative than those about other fields, but this effect is not significant when we control for the number of citations to these articles. In addition, we show that the bias is driven by the fact that Wikipedia articles about academics have fewer references to their work than do articles about other disciplines. These results suggest that Wikipedia's focus on the humanities may lead it to produce an overly positive view of academia.\nThis is a very interesting study. I think it does a good job of showing how Wikipedia can skew the way people perceive certain topics. It also shows that there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of how Wikipedia presents information about academics. For example, if you look at the article on the University of California system, it says that UC Berkeley is one of the top ten universities in the world, yet it doesn't mention that they're ranked #1 in the US. That would be a much better representation of what the university actually is.\nI'm sure there will be some who say that this isn't really relevant because Wikipedia is just a collection of random links to other websites. But I don't see how that could possibly be true. If Wikipedia was just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it had a problem? And if Wikipedia were just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why didn't anyone notice that it was being edited by a group of editors with a clear agenda?\nIf Wikipedia is just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it had a problem?\nAnd if Wikipedia is just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it was being edited by a group of editors with a clear agenda?\nIt seems like a pretty big deal that Wikipedia is being used as a source of information about academics.

    "Former Liverpool and Aston Villa striker, Milan Baros, faces an uncertain future as his contract with Czech club Banik Ostrava nears its end. The 38-year-old, who has had a prolific career spanning over two decades, is yet to receive a new offer from the club, sparking speculation about his next move.\n\nBaros, who won the Golden Boot at Euro 2004, returned to his boyhood club Banik Ostrava in 2017 after stints in Turkey and France. Despite his age, he has been a key player for the club, scoring 14 goals in 30 appearances last season. However, with his contract set to expire in June, there are doubts over whether he will continue to play for the club or seek a new challenge elsewhere.\n\nThe Czech international has previously expressed his desire to end his career at Banik Ostrava, the club where he began his professional journey. However, the lack of a contract extension offer has raised questions about the club's plans for the veteran striker.\n\nBanik Ostrava's management has remained tight-lipped about their intentions. When asked about Baros' future, club president Vlastimil Kostal said, \"We are in the process of planning for the next season. We will make announcements at the appropriate time.\"\n\nBaros' agent, Pavel Paska, has also refused to comment on the situation, further fuelling speculation about the striker's future. \n\nDespite the uncertainty, Baros remains a popular figure among Banik Ostrava fans, who are eager to see him extend his stay at the club. His experience and leadership on the pitch have been invaluable for the team, particularly for the younger players.\n\nAs the speculation continues, it remains to be seen whether Baros will hang up his boots at Banik Ostrava or if he will continue his illustrious career elsewhere. Regardless of the outcome, his contribution to the club and to Czech football will not be forgotten.",

    "I've been playing this game for a couple of years now and I've seen it go through numerous updates. Initially, these updates were exciting, bringing in new features, fixing bugs, and generally improving the gameplay experience. However, recently, I've noticed a significant decline in the quality of these updates.\n\nEvery new update now seems to introduce more bugs than it fixes. The game crashes frequently, the graphics glitch, and the load times have become unbearable. The new features, instead of enhancing the gameplay, are making it more complicated and less enjoyable. It feels like the developers are more focused on adding flashy, unnecessary elements rather than improving the core mechanics of the game.\n\nMoreover, the game has become increasingly pay-to-win. Every update introduces new items or characters that can only be obtained through in-game purchases, giving an unfair advantage to those who are willing to spend more money. This is a stark departure from the game's initial promise of being skill-based.\n\nI've tried reaching out to the developers through their customer support, but my concerns seem to fall on deaf ears. It's disheartening to see a game I once loved deteriorate like this. I hope the developers take note of the community's feedback and work towards improving the game, rather than just focusing on monetization.\n\nI wanted to share my thoughts here to see if anyone else feels the same way. Maybe if enough of us voice our concerns, the developers might take notice and make some much-needed changes.",

    "Inelastic effects in low-energy electron reflectivity of two-dimensional materials\n\nWe present a theoretical study of the low-energy electron reflectivity (LEER) of two-dimensional (2D) materials. We show that the LEER spectrum of a 2D material is composed of two parts: a sharp peak at the Fermi energy and a broad background. The sharp peak is due to the elastic scattering of electrons by the 2D material, while the broad background is due to inelastic scattering. We derive an analytical expression for the background and show that it is proportional to the imaginary part of the dielectric function of the 2D material. We also show that the background is strongly enhanced when the 2D material is placed on a substrate. We apply our theory to graphene and MoS2 and show that the background is indeed enhanced in these materials. Our results suggest that the background can be used to probe the inelastic properties of 2D materials.\n\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nLow-energy electron reflectivity (LEER) is a powerful technique for studying the electronic structure of materials. 1,2 It has been used to study a wide range of materials, including metals, semiconductors, and insulators. 3,4 LEER is based on the fact that electrons incident on a material at low energies can be reflected elastically or inelastically. The reflected electrons are then detected, and their energy and angle of incidence can be measured. The LEER spectrum is the distribution of the reflected electrons as a function of their energy and angle of incidence.\nThe LEER spectrum of a material is composed of two parts: a sharp peak at the Fermi energy and a broad background. The sharp peak is due to the elastic scattering of electrons by the material, while the broad background is due to inelastic scattering. The sharp peak can be used to determine the Fermi energy of the material, while the broad background can be used to probe its inelastic properties.\nThe LEER spectrum of a material can be calculated theoretically using the Kubo formula. 5,6 This formula relates the LEER spectrum to the imaginary part of the dielectric function of the material. The Kubo formula has been used to calculate the LEER spectrum of a wide range of materials, including metals, semiconductors, and insulators. 3,4,7",
    "We present an algorithm that uses uncertainty estimation to improve the accuracy and speed of deep learning segmentation of fluorescence micrographs, using only sparse data. We show that our method can be used to classify images into different classes without any preprocessing or manual annotation. Our approach is based on the idea that the class labels are not fixed but rather depend on the underlying structure of the image. In particular, we propose a new model that allows us to estimate the uncertainty associated with each class label by estimating the mean and variance of the class labels. This technique enables us to perform robust classification tasks such as detecting objects in noisy images. The proposed model has been tested on several datasets including those obtained from the Human Genome Project (HGP), the International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and speed.",
    "BBC News Online\n\n13 December 2010, 09.24am IST\n\n\nNew cars are not media players yet… even BMW's new 5 Series is far behind the latest offerings of other car makers to capture much mainstream attention in Britain and most major markets..\n\n\nAccording to figures released tonight by independent researcher StatCounter, BlackBerry has managed just 2pc market share here compared with the 7-month average for all UK manufacturers - 1.7pc. It is followed by Nokia, which clocked up 1.3pc, Apple with 0.1pc, Audi at 0.2pc and Honda on 0.4pc. Blackberry did get 11.5% market share - roughly half that of the 3,600 or so total in production and those sold today. Yet this means that Blackberry - despite its efforts to gain traction for consumer messaging, browsing, photos, e-mail and call making services - lags far behind smartphones such as Samsung's Galaxy range as well as its own devices.\"One can also say that there has been an influx of new models into the premium segment,\" said Ben Woodroffe, regional director of mobile data and analyst at Ovum IT research. \"Yet a number of the leading brands we have tested in the premium industry for over 10 years still haven't really taken off in the UK. But one thing is clear; if you want premium phones these days, they need more people playing around for them.\" The fact is, most consumers appear to be content with using their current phones (some would argue, too happy). According to statistics supplied by Gartner, 92% of consumers globally still use personal cellphones as their primary device while only 8 pc prefer other form factors and 4pc use tablets. Among them, BlackBerry users - who were less likely than iPhone owners to report owning more than 4 devices overall -- hold some catching up to do.\n\n\nBlackBerry's last generation devices - both Blackberry Playbook, Blackberry Storm, and BB10-based QNX - represented significant advancements for the smartphone platform as an OS, but few were particularly convincing when it came to actual handsets. Its QWERTY keyboard, built-in calendar and location apps, and sleek aesthetics were attractive and welcomed additions, but they didn't fully replace older systems or match new offerings from rivals.

    "As an audience, you embark on an incomparable excursion of suspense and mystery while watching \"The Number 23\". This movie centers around a chilling riddle linked to the number 23 that appears to dominate the life of Walter Sparrow, a character profoundly brought to life by Jim Carrey. It showcases a thrilling ride towards unearthing hidden secrets and a complex web of intrigue.\n\nCarrey's performance throughout the movie is surprisingly refreshing, as he breaks away from his usual comedic roles to deliver a character reeling in psychological torment with complete conviction. Alongside him, Virginia Madsen delivers an equally compelling performance as Sparrow's wife. The duo's on-screen chemistry and impressive performances succeed in holding the viewers' interest through the movie's unpredictable twists and turns.\n\nThe storyline is unique and certainly compelling, setting it apart from your typical psychological thrillers. Director Joel Schumacher masterfully fosters a dark, eerie atmosphere that establishes and builds the suspense impressively. However, the movie suffers from its convoluted script and overstuffed plot that disperses focus from the primary narrative and relies heavily on voiceovers that interrupt the cinematic experience.\n\nDespite its ambiguous ending that could infuriate some viewers, \"The Number 23\" skillfully pervades numerous interpretations, prompting viewers to ponder over elements long after the movie is over. Effective cinematography, evocative intrigue, and careful suspense make this movie worth watching.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the excessive reliance on the number 23 can be overwhelming for some and might wander into the realm of eccentricity. Nevertheless, for those seeking an unusual thriller, with a haunting undercurrent and standout performances, \"The Number 23\" may be a satisfying watch. \n\nBold, nerve-wracking, and undoubtedly distinct, this film encapsulates a mystery that will both chill and enchant you.",

    "In this film, we find that the planet-sized alien robot war has been going on for several thousand years. In each movie, a small fraction of the robots on Earth have come to see our world for what it is: A barren wasteland devoid of any technological advancement that is inhabited mostly by a sub-species of human primitives, with little chance of survival, even in groups as large as four persons. We know this because in each film we see them trying to leave Earth. And the aliens always tell them, no go. But, of course, they all ignore these dire warnings and ultimately end up dead.In the first movie, the Decepticons invade Earth and kill thousands of people, yet are ultimately unsuccessful in their mission to find and use Allspark or they all would have died... or not.In the second movie, the aliens return to Earth and the Autobots are so eager to help the humans, they allow themselves to be killed on the battlefield instead of leaving Earth. I mean, they could have flown up into outer space and made it to Alpha-Centauri and set up new colonies in Alpha Centauri 3, 4, 13, 14, or 15.I mean, all these intelligent robots and all that time and they can't come up with a way to establish a base on the next planet to ours? Really?!In this film, all the humans are working together in a coalition designed to fight the war with the Decepticons, even though only the Americans have any real weapons. All the other governments have sent them guns, but the Americans are the only ones with any bullets. It's funny how that works.So the story goes. They have to fight the war with giant robots on their side, so the humans have to provide the money and the guns. And the aliens have to keep fighting until all the resources are depleted and everything else is destroyed.I'm going to call this story a \"human story\" because in this movie there are humans. Not in the first two. There, the humans were merely there to witness the events, maybe to die, and to ultimately become the next group of aliens, I assume.Anyway, the whole reason for the war is that the Decepticons have the Allspark on board their spaceship and they need it to take over the world, so they have to get it.",
    "\"Accurate segmentation of medical images is a challenging task, especially, when no ground-truth labels are available. Existing works focus on either designing deep models, or constructing various self-supervised strategies with data augmentation from the images which limits generalization to unseen clinical data. In this paper, we propose a spatial guided self-supervised clustering network (S 3 -Net), which exploits inter-class and inter-modality distances as an additional self-supervised signal from the spatial structure of an input image to guide the clustering process. Further, the global information is used for predicting an auxiliary distribution. Our method encourages the clustering result in the embedding space to follow the target distribution, which allows S 3 -Net to be robust and generalization in the presence of domain shift. We train our network without any extra labels or annotated examples. Our experimental results show that S 3 -Net achieves state-of-the-art on four medical image segmentation datasets, i.e, ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion, DRIVE, STARE and DRSST-II. The model is also shown to be robust to the presence of domain gap in the inputs, and the code for replicating the method is provided.\"\n\nC. Ablation Study\nThe ablation study showed results in Table 4, and Figure 4, 5.\nIn Table 4, ablation study (1) showed that the combination of the intra-class distance and the inter-modality distance has an important role in boosting the performance of the network. (2) showed that the combination of the intra-class distance, the inter-class distance and the intermodality distance boosts much more the performance of the network. In Figure 4, 5, ablation study clearly shows the need for these distances which helped us in creating our model. In all these results, the combination of intraclass and inter-modality distance, as well as the combination of all three distances helped our system to perform more accurate segmentation of the data.\n\nD. Qualitative results\nIn Figure 6, we show the qualitative results of our model on ISIC 2018 Skin lesion dataset, where we can clearly see that our model could perform very well even for the dataset which only contains training segmentation images. Similarly, in Figure 7, we show the qualitative results of our model for the DRIVE(Diabetic Retin",
    "In a thrilling display of skill and strategy, Ireland has surged past Scotland in a significant victory that has left fans and critics alike in awe. The Irish team showcased their prowess on the field, leaving the Scots trailing behind in a game that was as intense as it was unpredictable.\n\nThe match, held at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, saw the Irish team dominate from the start. The Scots put up a valiant fight, but the Irish were relentless in their pursuit of victory. The final scoreline read a convincing 32-14 in favour of the home side.\n\nIreland's performance was marked by a combination of tactical brilliance and physical dominance. The team's forwards were particularly impressive, overpowering their Scottish counterparts in the scrums and line-outs. The backline, too, was in fine form, with the centres making several incisive runs that left the Scottish defence scrambling.\n\nThe star of the show was undoubtedly Ireland's fly-half, who orchestrated the team's attacks with precision and flair. His tactical kicking kept the Scots on the back foot, while his distribution was instrumental in setting up several of Ireland's tries.\n\nScotland, on the other hand, struggled to find their rhythm. Despite showing glimpses of their potential, they were unable to match the intensity and skill of the Irish. Their defence was porous at times, allowing the Irish to break through and score on multiple occasions.\n\nThe result is a significant boost for Ireland, who have been building momentum in recent matches. The victory over Scotland is a testament to their progress and a clear indication of their potential to challenge the top teams in the world.\n\nFor Scotland, the defeat is a setback, but there were still positives to take from the game. Their resilience and determination were evident throughout, and they will undoubtedly learn from the experience.\n\nThe match was a spectacle of high-quality rugby, with both teams demonstrating their commitment to the sport. Despite the result, the Scots can hold their heads high, knowing they gave their all against a formidable Irish side.\n\nAs the dust settles on this thrilling encounter, the focus now shifts to the next round of matches. If this game is anything to go by, fans can look forward to more exciting rugby in the weeks to come.",

    "(CNN) -- \"I, Robot\" (2004). In fact, there's little doubt that most moviegoers who turned out to see \"I, Robot\" did so after seeing Will Smith do his thing in movies like \"Independence Day\" (1996) or \"Men in Black\" (1997) or \"Men in Black II\" (2002), or in other smash hits like \"Enemy of the State\" (1998), \"Wild Wild West\" (1999) and \"Bad Boys\" (1995). And those people, despite the hype and the good word of mouth, saw a very good movie; those others saw something else -- or nothing at all. As if the movie itself weren't a disappointment enough, it's also worth pointing out that -- given the movie's title, the \"I,\" and the subtitle itself -- one really does have at least some expectations going into \"I, Robot,\" and to see them unfulfilled is just too bad. So: Is it that \"I, Robot\" is a bad movie?\nNo. Not much at all.\nIt's certainly a disappointing one, because it could have been something different -- far different -- had there been more imagination and/or interest behind the movie. But it's not a bad movie at all.\n\"I, Robot\" -- whose title is a phrase that comes, of course, from Asimov's work -- may have come to this theater near you in the wake of the 2004 movie \"The Day After Tomorrow,\" which also dealt with the implications of global warming. The end of the ice age in \"The Day After Tomorrow\" is, of course, the product of a comet (as opposed to a massive global warming); there is little or no evidence that such a thing was ever actually possible, but the movie does present a chilling -- no pun intended, really -- depiction of how such a thing might be possible. As for \"I, Robot\" itself, no, the movie doesn't offer such a dire warning... not directly, at least. But while the warning may come indirectly, it is still very much part of \"I, Robot,\" and it may, in fact, be the very best part of the film.\nWhich is quite a feat of sorts, given the number of truly bad movies we've seen this year (including \"",
    "Hello everyone,\n\nI hope you're all doing well. I'm excited to announce that I'm back with the song polls! I know it's been a while since the last one, but I've been working on some new ideas and I'm eager to share them with you.\n\nFor those who are new or need a refresher, the song polls are a fun way for us to interact and share our opinions on different songs. I'll post a poll featuring a selection of songs, and you all get to vote on your favorites. It's a great way to discover new music and see how your tastes compare to others in the community.\n\nThis time around, I've decided to mix things up a bit. Instead of focusing on one genre, I'll be including a variety of genres in each poll. I think this will make the polls more interesting and inclusive.\n\nI'll be posting the first poll later today, so keep an eye out for it. As always, I'm open to suggestions for songs to include in future polls. Feel free to comment below or send me a private message with your ideas.\n\nThanks for your continued support and participation.

    "I'm hoping to have my 4Runner shipped as soon as possible so I can check it out and see what it means about warranties. I've seen many posts on here from other owners who have had warranty problems and/or say that they are willing to trade for a trade-in. One of the owners of my 4Runner had what was supposed to be a warranty trade-in, and after several weeks, the transmission decided to stop working entirely. All his issues were the same problems I had. The mechanic eventually replaced it (and said he was going to ship out this morning), but then within a few days, it started working again.\n\nI've seen a lot of complaints about 4runners that have had the transmission in their drive unit on and off throughout the day for multiple weeks. I've also seen a lot of \"no warranty\" 5wrx owners with 2.7t's which have been running fine for years and the owners say they aren't worried about the problems we have. What is going on here? What do these owners have that ours didn't?\n\nWell, the first thing you need to know is that there is indeed a difference between the 2.7L and 5.8L TBI transmissions on both the Silverado 1500 and 2500 and 5.7L V-6 on both the Grand Wagoneer and Laredo. If you had a TBI transmission installed on something during the past few years, you can probably use that. If you haven't already, go and take your car in and see what it says under the \"Mechanical\" tab.\n\nThe transmission is basically what makes the vehicle go and is the major part of the transmission. It is the thing that connects the powertrain and the transfer case. It comes with a torque converter and a flywheel and also features a serpentine clutch, which is essentially a belt that keeps the transmission in one position while it spins the transfer case. This type of clutch is referred to as a serpentine.\n\nA TBI transmission will have the following internals:\n\nOil system (two quarts/liter – two for 1500, one for 2500)\n\nThrottle body, which is where the engine's intake manifold is connected to the manifold. It is comprised of a pair of intake pipes (one for each bank of cylinders), an oxygen sensor connected to the throttle body,",
    "So, I just had to share this because I'm still in shock about what happened. I went to a local restaurant for dinner tonight, a place I've been to many times before and always had a great experience. But tonight was a complete disaster.\n\nFirst, it took them 20 minutes to even acknowledge that I was there. I was seated at a table and then completely ignored. I had to flag down a waiter just to get a menu. Then, when I finally got to order, they got my order completely wrong. I ordered a vegetarian pasta, and they brought me a steak. When I pointed out the mistake, the waiter argued with me, insisting that I had ordered the steak.\n\nAfter they finally agreed to bring me the correct meal, I waited another 30 minutes. By this point, I was starving and just wanted to eat and leave. But when the food finally arrived, it was cold. Not just lukewarm, but actually cold. I couldn't believe it.\n\nI asked to speak to the manager, but was told they were too busy to speak to me. I was so frustrated and upset, I just left without eating anything. I've never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant before. I'm still in shock over how poorly I was treated. I definitely won't be going back there again. \n\nJust needed to vent about this.

    "[embedded content]\n\nPassengers\n\nBased on a true story, the epic fantasy of a young woman (Amy Adams) who gets separated from her group on a crowded airline flight, Passengers follows her from the start of her struggle to find a way home as her life and romance with Christopher Jackson (Dominic Cooper) unfold. Starring Chris Pratt, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Zoe Saldana, and Michael Sheen, this is an adaptation from the screenplay by (and father of the film) Drew Goddard.\n\nAmy Adams is beautiful, funny, and strong as ever in this film from director Denis Villeneuve (\"Arrival\" and \"Blade Runner\"). I was worried that the fact that she is portrayed as somewhat of an object of desire for Jackson and the men around him would overshadow the film's emotional themes. But in the end, it does not.\n\nIt is only as we reach the end that the film starts to reveal how fragile the relationship between Amy and Jackson actually is. We meet the various passengers and crew members as they are struggling with their own problems and trying to get home to their families. From one passenger, we learn that Amy could not possibly be that beautiful after all, as an attempt by the airline proves that she is, in fact, rather thin. Another of the passengers explains how he could not even get his luggage out of his checked suitcase. In the end, we see the two trying desperately to make it through together, and it is Amy who is getting more and more distressed with every passing moment.\n\nVilleneuve clearly understands the gravity of the situation in which the two of them are trapped, and how they must survive together. The tension is building all the while, and Amy gives a great performance. Her relationship with Jackson goes from a situation that is purely romantic, to one in which they must share in the struggles of others, all with the hope that they will escape.\n\nAlthough the film is not without its faults, I must agree with the other reviewers who see a lot of potential for the film. In conclusion, this is one of those movies that, like \"Prisoners,\" just might do great business at the box office, particularly as it continues to open in a number of different international territories and hopefully, eventually in the USA.\n\nAdvertisements",

    "A parliamentary inquiry has found that MPs and peers have been involved in more than £1 billion worth of fraud, abuse and corruption over the past 30 years. The report by the Public Administration Select Committee (PASC) says it was \"unacceptable\" for politicians to be able to use their positions to enrich themselves at taxpayers' expense. It also calls on the Government to take action against those who abused public funds. The committee said there had been an \"epidemic\" of misconduct in Parliament since the 1980s, with some MPs and peers taking advantage of their position to make millions of pounds through bribes, kickbacks and other corrupt practices. The PASC report comes as the Government prepares to publish its own investigation into allegations of widespread wrongdoing within Westminster. The Prime Minister will announce today that he intends to set up a new independent body to investigate claims of corruption and malpractice in politics. But the PASC report suggests that the current system of oversight may not work because too many people are willing to turn a blind eye to wrongdoing. In particular, the committee says that the lack of transparency surrounding expenses claims means that MPs can claim expenses without being held accountable. The report says: \"It is unacceptable that MPs and peers were able to use their positions to enrich themselves at taxpayers' expense.\" It adds: \"There is no evidence that any MP or peer has ever been prosecuted for misuse of public money.\" The report also criticises the way in which the House of Commons pays for its staff, saying that it should be scrapped and replaced with a flat-rate salary. It recommends that MPs pay for their own travel costs, but says they should be reimbursed if they do so voluntarily. The committee says that MPs should be required to declare all gifts above £100, including hospitality, and that they should be banned from accepting free flights and luxury goods. It also calls for a ban on MPs using taxpayer-funded cars and helicopters. The report concludes: \"We believe that the current arrangements for accountability and transparency in Parliament are inadequate and need urgent reform.\"\n\nIn addition to this, the BBC reported that the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Sir John Jenkins, has launched his own investigation into the matter. He stated that he would look into whether the rules governing MPs' expenses are being followed properly.\n\nThis is just one example of how the British political establishment is becoming increasingly corrupt.",

    "Angels & Demons (2013) - Angie's first film, and the first film directed by Angie. Angie's characters have to deal with a very mysterious \"angel\" named Angel (played by Angie and written by herself); not much is known about him and there is little interaction between Angie and him. Angie shows many great emotional scenes, such as the one at the end of the film when Angel explains that he did not really need her. The film also features some of Angie's classic lines like \"there are no angels; you can never see a beautiful thing and if you do, it was not a beautiful thing\" and \"I am not a person; I am an angel\". While there are some scenes in which Angel seems manipulative, he does seem to act according to his nature, which is shown in his decision to let Angie use his power to save her. Despite its unusual themes, and some questionable plot points, Angies performance will always stay in my heart. If you like this review, please share it and comment it!",

    "Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has launched a scathing attack on the Conservative Party's spending plans, describing them as \"short-sighted\" and \"economically irresponsible\".\n\nIn a speech delivered at the Labour Party conference, Mr Blair criticised the Tories' proposed cuts to public services, arguing that they would disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in society. He also questioned the party's commitment to reducing the deficit, suggesting that their plans lacked credibility.\n\n\"The Conservative Party's spending plans are not just economically irresponsible, they are morally indefensible,\" Mr Blair said. \"They are proposing deep cuts to public services that will hit the poorest hardest, while protecting the interests of the wealthy.\"\n\nMr Blair, who led Labour to three consecutive general election victories, also warned that the Tories' plans would undermine the economic recovery. He argued that investment in public services was crucial to long-term growth, and that the Conservatives' approach risked causing unnecessary damage.\n\n\"The Tories are gambling with our economic future,\" he said. \"Their short-sighted approach to public spending threatens to undermine the recovery and put jobs at risk. We need a balanced approach to reducing the deficit, not a slash-and-burn policy that puts ideology before people's livelihoods.\"\n\nMr Blair's comments come as the Conservative Party faces increasing scrutiny over its spending plans. Critics argue that the party has failed to provide sufficient detail about how it intends to achieve its deficit reduction targets, leading to accusations of a lack of transparency.\n\nThe former Prime Minister's intervention is likely to add to the pressure on the Conservatives, who are currently leading in the polls ahead of the next general election. However, the party has defended its plans, arguing that they are necessary to ensure the long-term stability of the economy.\n\nA spokesperson for the Conservative Party responded to Mr Blair's comments, saying: \"Our spending plans are focused on securing a strong and stable economy for the future. We are committed to reducing the deficit in a fair and balanced way, and we will always protect the most vulnerable in society.\"\n\nDespite his criticisms, Mr Blair stopped short of endorsing Labour's own spending plans, saying only that they were \"a step in the right direction\". His comments are likely to fuel speculation about his relationship with the current Labour leadership, which has been strained in recent years.",
    "We present an algorithm that generates images from eye movements, using a combination of image recognition and motion estimation techniques. We show how to use this method to generate images from eye-movement data in real time, without requiring any special hardware or software. Our approach uses a novel neural network architecture based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent connections between layers. The CNNs are trained by applying a sequence of training examples to the input layer, which results in a set of weights that can be used to predict the next frame of the video. This allows us to extract features from the video such as eye position, orientation, and movement. We then apply our model to generate a series of frames from these features, and we compare the generated frames against those produced by hand-drawn animation. We find that our system produces significantly better results than hand-drawn animation, even when the number of frames per second is increased to 100 fps.",
    "This paper extends a system that was recently described that trained on a medical sample of 32,832 images to provide semi-supervised training for a new system trained on 17,072 images. Our approach uses an approach that enables high-dimensional data to be classified and learned in a poisequely independent poisson fashion. Our solution extends existing models that allow classification of discrete features and enables classification of larger data and larger features using only as many samples as necessary to achieve acceptable accuracy based on the training data. These applications show PoissonSeg as a general architecture that can be used for segmenting medical images, and for many different tasks.\n\nA short version of the complete paper is available online, and is also available on Pre-print server\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this work PoissonSeg is applied to medical images from 34,939 subjects, an issue that has drawn great interest because of its clinical relevance. We introduce and evaluate a method that extends existing methods that enable semi-supervised learning and enables classification of discrete features and classification of larger data on a single training sample. Our method is based on methods in the supervised learning literature. It extends recent methods to classifying finite and semidefinite features on single training datasets, and also to classify features of infinite dimensional data. We show that we can learn PoissonSeg with only as many images that are used to train the classifier, and show that this training problem is similar to that of the previous state-of-the-art in the literature. We use PoissonSeq to classify real medical images, as well as training classes. We show that PoissonSeq is more efficient than previous methods in both the supervised and unsupervised learning of features and in some domains, and even outperforms our previous state-of-the-art in a few domains, providing us with a promising framework to improve the performance of the general method.\n\nSource code available in C code, as well as a tutorial.\n\nReference:\n\n[1] O'Keeffe, O., Lautmaniec, D., and Y.

    "\"Into the Wild\" is a cinematic masterpiece that takes viewers on a profound journey of self-discovery, freedom, and the human spirit. Directed by Sean Penn, the film is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who abandons his conventional life to embark on a solitary journey into the Alaskan wilderness.\n\nEmile Hirsch delivers a compelling performance as McCandless, capturing the character's idealism, courage, and vulnerability with remarkable authenticity. The supporting cast, including William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, and Vince Vaughn, also deliver strong performances, adding depth and nuance to the narrative.\n\nThe film's cinematography is breathtaking, with sweeping shots of the American landscape that underscore the beauty and harshness of the natural world. The soundtrack, featuring songs by Eddie Vedder, complements the film's tone perfectly, enhancing the emotional resonance of key scenes.\n\n\"Into the Wild\" is not just a film about a man's journey into nature; it's a contemplation on the meaning of life, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness. It explores the allure of solitude and the human need for connection, presenting a balanced view of McCandless's ideals and the consequences of his choices.\n\nThe film's pacing may be slow for some, but it allows for a deeper immersion into McCandless's world. The non-linear narrative structure, which alternates between past and present, adds a layer of complexity to the storytelling, revealing key aspects of McCandless's character and backstory at strategic points.\n\n\"Into the Wild\" is a thought-provoking film that will resonate with viewers long after the credits roll. It's a poignant reminder of the power of cinema to inspire, challenge, and move us. Whether you agree with McCandless's actions or not, there's no denying the impact of his story and the skill with which it's brought to life on screen.",

Its lead track The Dark Side Of Your Mouth has been nominated four times thus far – twice in rock album and two more for its single Donker!…\n\nSongs by soul singer Sir Peter Blake also join the list of winners so far this year, while classic soul artist David Tua's song The Lightness Of Our Love has picked up three nods – including Best Pop Solo Performance which it wins to add a second Grammy. With almost 200 different songs across 40 winners, there are already close to 100 categories to go at the 60th annual awards ceremony on Sunday night (UK time).\n\nSoul Coughing were first announced as a nominee last week along with Blondie; a collaboration which was confirmed after it turned out that co-producer Terry Lewis was actually credited as producer during filming of his cameo appearance in Superstar! He received one nod too – for Song Of The Year – being hailed by British music fans. It beat favourites by The Black Eyed Peas, Midge Ure, and Rihanna! to take out the prize.\n\nSinger David Tua said he felt honoured that the award show would recognise his work, adding: \"This is not usually what you hear when I talk about my music being recognized like this.\"\n\nAnother soul pioneer, Tony Allen, who won his fourth Grammy earlier this month for What You See Is What You Get, commented: \"[It's like] my mum coming home from work all proud and saying 'That person did a great job'. So I'm very grateful!\".\n\nOther artists who got their moment in the spotlight include Soul II Soul frontman Roberta Flack who had multiple tracks on five trophies on Saturday morning, with his hit My Back Pages picking up Best Rock Vocal Album for best debut release but taking home six other nominations.\n\nCatherine Zeta Jones landed three nods – Song of the Year, album award and song of the year, beating Rihanna for her chart topping single Umbrella & A Rose By Any Other Name. She called herself a \"big dreamer\".\n\nKiller Mike took the biggest hits winner for his track Man In The Box, with 11 nominees in total.

    "Scotland's women's football team coach, Shelley Kerr, has expressed her frustration at the narrow victory margin in their recent match against Portugal. Despite the team's 1-0 win, Kerr believes the squad could have performed better and secured a more comfortable victory.\n\nThe Scottish team dominated the game, with a possession rate of 60% and 15 shots on goal. However, they only managed to convert one of these opportunities, a fact that Kerr found disappointing.\n\n\"We should have been more clinical in front of the goal,\" Kerr said in a post-match interview. \"We had numerous chances to increase our lead and make the game safe, but we didn't take them. It's frustrating because we know we can do better.\"\n\nThe only goal of the match came from Erin Cuthbert in the 68th minute, securing Scotland's victory. However, Kerr believes that the team's inability to capitalise on their dominance could cost them in future matches.\n\n\"We can't afford to be wasteful in front of the goal,\" she added. \"In a tournament situation, goal difference can be crucial, and we need to ensure we're taking every opportunity to increase our tally.\"\n\nDespite her frustration, Kerr praised her team's overall performance, highlighting their strong defensive play and control of the game. She also commended Cuthbert for her decisive goal.\n\n\"Erin showed great composure to score the only goal of the game,\" Kerr said. \"She's a fantastic player and a key part of our team.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Kerr emphasised the need for improvement in the team's finishing. She believes that with more clinical execution, the team can secure more convincing victories in their upcoming matches.\n\n\"We have a talented squad, and I have every confidence in their abilities,\" she said. \"We just need to be more ruthless in front of the goal. If we can do that, I'm confident we can achieve great things.\"\n\nScotland's next match is against Spain, a team known for their strong defence. Kerr is hopeful that her team can learn from their recent match and secure a more comfortable victory.",

    "This paper presents an innovative approach to automatic color image segmentation using a square elemental region-based seeded region growing and merging method. The proposed method aims to overcome the limitations of traditional image segmentation techniques by incorporating a square elemental region-based approach, which enhances the accuracy and efficiency of the segmentation process. The method begins with an initial segmentation into square elemental regions, followed by a seeded region growing process, and finally a merging process to combine similar regions. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using various color images, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high-quality segmentation results. The method is robust, computationally efficient, and capable of handling images with complex structures and varying textures. This research contributes to the field of image processing by providing a novel method for automatic color image segmentation.",
    "http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/1150.pdf\n\nPlease cite the author in your work, but make sure you give credit to arXiv.\n\nAbstract We present SynNet, an efficient structure preserving, fully convolutional neural network algorithm that achieves performance on multiple levels and is scalable over arbitrarily large training data sets without loss of generality or efficiency. Our approach is inspired by the work (i) of Chown et al. [1] and refined upon them; and (ii) of Yudkowsky & Jirsa [2] who achieved the same effect using non-resolvable neural networks with no fixed size, allowing them to be trained via stochastic gradient descent in sparse images. However SynNet's learning rate is variable among layers, making it suitable for use at an intermediate level within a dataset requiring sparsely connected, high dimensional representations instead of just continuous features. For this reason we also provide implementations of SynNet for nlmsolver [3], the OpenCog[4], VGG[5], HUDS[6]; for example. SynNet implements both forward inference and backward propagation through time based prediction functions, which together achieve the same end goal while having independent advantages per problem domain: deep, invariant inference while retaining generality, and fast-paced prediction with improved accuracy if our initial predictions are not perfect. The main advantages of this technique lie in its compact implementation, which allows high precision training directly from the raw input image and efficient memory management (e.g., on CPU) for storing intermediate representations inside the recurrent connections and minimizing computation time. As mentioned before, it has been demonstrated to support state-of-the-art results and outperforms other techniques such as Gaussian processes on medical imaging tasks [7]. We also propose theoretical explanations to explain how our method achieves these impressive performances even though these theories can't explicitly account for all reasons why SynNet achieves comparable accuracy to current state-of-the-art methods that combine many small hidden units into single layer networks but operate on mathematically equivalent classes of sequences.",
    "After watching the film you are left with an unpleasant feeling of regret and wonderment, which leaves you longing on who you could have been and what could have become if time travelers were ever to visit our world today.\n\n\nBut in all honesty we are not here for the nostalgia alone as we come to find out the truth behind what was left behind when the story is played backwards, where it seems that fate has conspired to present us with a reality so different than the one we inhabit, where most seem to think that no one would see through this facade like they did in the movie; and then only after some years have past when a young teen named Dory gets tangled up into this mystery herself…\n\n\nThis movie truly brought back emotions I was never able to feel again after watching The Matrix or Spider Man movies for that matter… This version is a cinematic experience unlike any other in cinema history and certainly among my favorite films to date.\n\n\nIt may be best categorized as science fiction adventure or an environmental fable depending on how much you took to its plot lines despite having known about it since the 70s…. (this reviews focuses mostly on those aspects though).\n\n\nAs for animation itself we can safely say that Disney/Pixar created at their peak it's masterpiece in this area... Although there will always be people willing to criticize or criticize the way Pixar uses computer-generated graphics because by far they work the closest in terms of looking real; but if anything they even take some more things from Disney/Pixar's catalogue to use as well. (you'll notice they do have some characters that look vaguely familiar). What is actually really weird as the characters and environments aren't CGI, they are produced with a very thin layer of paint over them using the same technology which had existed for quite a while before this film even came along. It works pretty damn good. And just like any animated action sequence it does require attention at once as a lot of thought must go put together and this should not be taken lightly as there is a surprising amount of details, animations, and music used during certain scenes… especially as it will change between your three screens (three eyes are needed at times)… The animation itself is very fluid and easy to follow but there are also many special effects used throughout which add another level of realism. The story, acting, voice talent… everything makes this film feel alive…",
    "A friend and I thought that the most useful recipes were those that required only one item. In order to achieve this with the Horadric Cube or any other crafting table, we would probably need at least 2 perfect souls. We also wanted more than just one items used for it by a combination of being able to make something not on our table, using an unique drop, etc... So we built three new versions of the recipe where you can get two additional items. Both a standard 1-item version, as well as a 2-items version (since that seems to require a soul). The reason why we got two different versions was so that we could have a single perfect item for use in all 3 types of crafting. The 1-link version comes from using the Horadric Cube or any other perfect cube for your first item, before doing anything else; the 2 item setup come after adding another 2 perfect soul gems (note how 2 stones are listed). This gives us 2 perfect hearts to work with if someone has more than likely started making a map.

    "\"Princess Mononoke\" is an absolute masterpiece from animated film legend Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. This movie surpasses animated film norms, breaking the boundaries between children's entertainment and philosophical art. Presenting with a rich narrative, the movie effortlessly addresses environmental and social issues, yet maintains its whimsical animation thrill.\n\nMarked with stellar animation and intricate visual designs, the movie presents a vivid reflection of feudal Japan and its relationship with pristine nature. A tale of humans, nature, and gods, it compels us to ponder over our living realities. Set amidst the conflict between the industrial revolution and nature, the film presents Ashitaka, a young warrior embarking on a journey to seek harmony. As he crosses paths with the fierce Princess Mononoke (San), the viewer is sucked into mystical realms where gods become beasts and animals turn into mythical creatures.\n\nMiyazaki's storytelling genius is exemplary. Drawing from Japanese folklore, he introduces viewers to memorable characters, each with their well-developed arcs. Whether it's Kodoma, the curiosity-arousing tree spirit, or multi-dimensional villains like Lady Eboshi, none of the characters appear flat. There is moral complexity sewn into all characters, refusing to paint any of them with a simple evil palette. \n\nHowever, even with its intense themes, the movie does not forgo tenderness.

The results of this study provide valuable insights into the electronic structure of ABC-trilayer graphene and contribute to the broader understanding of the physics of low-dimensional materials.",
    "I'm in my late 20s and I've been struggling with depression for about two years now. It's gotten to the point where I can't function at all, and it's getting worse every day. I have no friends, I don't go out much, and I feel like I'm constantly on edge. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I know that if I just get through this one more week, then maybe things will be better. But I'm afraid that if I try anything else, I'll end up back here again. I'm scared that I won't make it through another year without having some kind of breakdown. I'm also worried that I might never recover. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm going crazy. I want to live, but I can't seem to find any way to do it. I'm really sorry if this sounds like you or someone you know. I hope that you're able to find something positive to take away from this.

    "Abstract A maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of abelians on different manifolds with topological invariant representations leads to remarkable results such as the creation of axioms of bifurcations at any abelian group. The axiomatics here are of relatively little interest, however, since they arise within an idealization of Banach algebras that can be represented by a single graph R(|R|). The current work extends the idea beyond the trivialization of this graph R using additional graphs R′′ which correspond both to higher order operators of the Lie algebra \\eta and its extension R(|φ|). The new theory generates unique monoidal structures called maximal abelian subalgebras over these extra 2-manifold graphs, where each vertex must correspond to a different operator. We provide some simple examples including one over the symmetric 4-topology B ( ρ | ϣ ) and three over B ( ⊗, π : p | γ ⟶ σ ). Here we prove important properties such as a proof of (1-)of universal completeness for all extensions of C*B to the above structure, and (2)-convexes in this general case. In fact, our results imply what might have been taken for granted only in the past century.\nAs explained earlier I know of much of the work involved in a somewhat less formalized context. If someone has a more complete account feel free to post it here in the comments so other readers may see more details.\nFor those interested the result was published in Numerical Mathematics.",

    "War game enthusiasts are duking it out in one of the largest international military simulation events ever staged. The marathon contest, called The Big War Game, pits thousands of players against each other in a virtual battle that spans the globe.\n\nTwo of the world's most popular war game franchises, \"Call of Duty\" and \"Battlefield\", are at the forefront of this enormous tournament. Matches are taking place online with players connecting from home or in some, cases, collective venues equipped with powerful gaming systems. The competition aims to crown the world's best military simulation team and also highlight the growing popularity of war-based video games.\n\n\"Cyber warfare has seen a significant rise in recent years and gaming is an integral part of it. The magnitude of this event reflects the global impact and interest that these games have generated,\" said Joanna Morgan, a gaming industry analyst.\n\nThe spectacle of battle commenced last weekend with hundreds of teams going head-to-head in virtual locales that are recreated from real-world conflict zones. From the desolate landscapes of Afghanistan in \"Call of Duty\"'s multiplayer maps to the sprawling cityscape in \"Battlefield\"'s \"Siege of Shanghai\", the games offer a sense of realism and adrenaline that has attracted a massive fan base.\n\nThe games are not just limited to these two franchises, as other games such as \"Arma 3\", \"World of Tanks\", and \"War Thunder\" also feature in the competition. \n\n\"These war games are more than just recreational activities. They stimulate critical thinking, tactical planning, and teamwork. They also serve as a cultural reference to global military history and contemporary conflicts,\" said Oliver Jackson, a professor of video game studies.\n\nBut while the games engage players with stunning graphics and intense gameplay, they have not been without their share of controversy. Critics argue that such games trivialize real-world conflict and warfare, desensitizing players to violence.\n\nIn response to this, many game developers and organizers of such events aim to balance gaming entertainment with an understanding of the realities of war. They encourage players to learn about the historical and geopolitical contexts presented in the games.\n\n\"By staging this competition, we're not just broadcasting our love for military strategy and action. We also want players and viewers to engage in dialogue about real-world conflicts and the impact of warfare,\" said Martin Turner, the organizer of The Big War Game.\n\nAs the games continue to rage on, players are digging into their arsenals, deploying strategies, and vying for supremacy in the digital battlefield.

    "A new study has found that more than half of all letters sent to UK households are junk mail, with one in five containing no information at all. The research by the Royal Mail and the University of Surrey also revealed that nearly two thirds of people receive at least one piece of junk mail every month. The findings come as the Government prepares to introduce tougher rules on junk mail after it was revealed last week that some firms were sending out millions of pieces of junk mail without authorisation. The survey of 2,000 adults found that almost three quarters (72%) received at least one piece of junk mail each month. More than half (56%) said they had received at least one letter which contained no information whatsoever. One in five (21%) received at least one letter which contained no information at all. A further 14% received at least one letter which contained only a picture or logo. The researchers say that this suggests that many people may be receiving junk mail without realising it. They warn that the results could have serious implications for society if people do not take action to stop being targeted. Professor David Stuckler, Director of the Centre for Consumer Research at the University of Surrey, who led the research, says: \"We know that junk mail can cause problems for consumers, but we didn't realise just how much. This research shows that there is a huge amount of junk mail circulating in our country.\" He added: \"It's important that people understand what junk mail is and what it isn't. Junk mail should never contain any personal details such as names, addresses or phone numbers. It should always include an unsubscribe link so you can opt-out of future correspondence.\" The Royal Mail has already announced plans to crack down on junk mail after it emerged that some companies were sending out millions of unwanted letters without authorisation. In March, the company launched a campaign called 'Stop Sending Us Your Junk'. The campaign will see the firm send out a million letters to customers warning them that their mail is being used illegally. The company claims that it has been forced to act because of growing concerns over the number of illegal junk mail scams. The Royal Mail has previously warned that it would launch a crackdown on illegal junk mail after it was discovered that some firms were sending out millions of unwanted letters without authorisation.

    "\"Jackie\" is a deeply moving and intimate exploration of one of the most tragic events in American history, seen through the eyes of the iconic First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy. Natalie Portman delivers a career-defining performance, embodying the grace, poise, and inner turmoil of Jackie with an uncanny precision. Her portrayal is not just an impersonation but a deeply felt understanding of a woman thrust into unimaginable grief and public scrutiny.\n\nThe film's narrative structure, which oscillates between the immediate aftermath of JFK's assassination, a later interview with a journalist, and flashbacks to Jackie's televised White House tour, is both innovative and effective. It allows for a layered, non-linear exploration of Jackie's psyche, making the film as much a character study as it is a historical drama.\n\nDirector Pablo Larraín's decision to shoot on 16mm film lends a grainy, vintage aesthetic that enhances the period authenticity. The close-up shots are particularly striking, often lingering on Portman's face, capturing every flicker of emotion. Mica Levi's haunting score, meanwhile, underscores the film's melancholic tone, evoking a sense of unease and disorientation that mirrors Jackie's emotional state.\n\n\"Jackie\" is not a conventional biopic. It does not attempt to encapsulate its subject's entire life but instead focuses on a pivotal moment that defined her. It's a bold, unflinching look at grief, legacy, and the burdens of public life. Some may find its pace slow and its approach too introspective, but for those willing to engage with its meditative rhythm, \"Jackie\" offers a rich, emotionally resonant cinematic experience.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Jackie\" is a beautifully crafted film that offers a fresh perspective on a familiar historical event. It's a testament to the power of cinema to humanize figures often relegated to the pages of history books. Natalie Portman's performance is nothing short of extraordinary, and the film itself is a poignant, thought-provoking piece of art.",

    "(via: www.imdb.com)\n\nIn \"Mystic River,\" director Paul Thomas Anderson stars as a man who decides to try heroin after failing a job interview, only to discover that the drug makes him feel like a member of a religious cult. (We've actually read this review from our sister site Bloody-Disgusting and we can confirm that it does appear to be the director.)\n\nWe've spoken about \"Mystic River\" over the years -- not necessarily for its art-house qualities (though it is certainly that), but for the strong emotional connections I'm sure Anderson seems to have to his characters. You might also notice at this link one of the first reviews of the movie. Though the title isn't quite as memorable, it contains these words: \"Mystic River is the most fascinating movie I've seen in a long time.\"\n\nSince we've all heard the same sorts of things, here's my second review for your consideration -- just for the sake of having an actual review and not just some random chatter over the internet: (via: www.imdb.com)\n\n\"Mystic River\" is a surprisingly complex story about drug use and religion, set in America in the early 1970s. One of the things we were curious to find out was why the film chose to be set in 1973. Well, it turns out that, though this seems a natural jump for the author (Thomas Pynchon, of course), it's a little more difficult than you might think.\n\nWhen the author wrote \"Inherent Vice\" in 1998, he never had an inkling that HBO would pick it up to be aired on HBO's premium channel in 2011. (That's also the year I turned 25.) This meant he had a six-week shot at directing his first movie and working with his brother, Robert, who is an artist and a writer. But in the interview below Anderson does make it clear that some of that time was spent thinking about other films, and specifically Pynchon's work.\n\nIn the documentary film \"I'm So Excited\" the directors discuss why this story felt right for them, especially given their work on \"Maus,\" the Oscar-winning film (which was recently restored, in theaters now) about the murder of a young girl by a man she believed in God but didn't really believe in",
    "The Men In Black are back and their latest mission involves infiltrating a secret weapons factory disguised as a hotel, to stop a madman who seems to be responsible for so much violence on Earth lately… I won't spoil any more of the plot! However it seems that not everyone is going his way, with some of his henchmen leaving or turning bad. It can get pretty dark at times too when evil-minded men try to do things like kidnap the U.S President's daughter. There's also some hilarious moments featuring your old buddy Tommy Lee Jones as the evil dictator; he keeps reminding you to take him seriously all to make you laugh every chance you get – until then, he's probably laughing maniacally at all those crazy explosions that go off. If there was a silver lining, well – I'd say it would be this brilliant score by Hans Zimmer that really does bring life to all these action scenes. I don't think I've ever seen anyone sound more menacingly epic than his, and his amazing cover of the Queen song makes perfect sense for an international spy film. Not to mention those unforgettable screams…\n\nAdvertisements",
    "This film is about two young men who are trying to make it in the NBA, but they have no idea how to do so. They're both very good players and they've been playing together since high school, but their egos get in the way of them working as a team. The story follows these two guys through their first season in the league, which ends with one of them being traded away by his coach. He then goes on to play for another team, where he gets injured again. This time, he's out for the entire year. When he comes back, he has to prove that he can still be an effective player.\n\nI'm not sure if this was written by someone who watched the movie or just read the synopsis, but I think it's pretty accurate. It's also interesting to note that the movie doesn't really focus on any specific teams or players, instead focusing more on the personalities involved.\n\nHere's what I thought of the movie:\n\nIt's funny! There were some moments when I laughed out loud at the movie, like when the two guys try to convince each other to go to the gym after practice. But overall, I found the movie to be fairly forgettable.\n\nOverall Rating: 3/5\n\nAdvertisements",
    "Abstract:\n\nWe have computed, over 10 different time scales, the sum of the average sum of the power fluxes of the sum of the strong decays of four types of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs): the light ones (the top 5% of the mass line), and two classes of heavier ones called b-mesons and muons. The WIMPs are emitted by black holes at the centers of quasar halos and in the core of active galactic nuclei. Here the WIMPs correspond to the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) line at energies between 11 and 16 TeV. By comparing the results with those from earlier studies, we show that the total emission from the four types of WIMPS during the 2023 summit is ~50,000 fb-1 cm-2 at a time interval of a few days. The summit-time spectrum (SST) is dominated by two type-I WIMPs. These are the heavy WIMPs that emit most of their radiation in the optical, and type-II WIMPs, which make up a large fraction of the light WIMP spectrum. The total peak-brightness of type-II WIMPs is significantly larger than from any other WIMP type. The total peak brightness of type-I WIMPs is significantly smaller than from any other WIMP type. We have found that the top two top qubit (type-I) WIMPs are the dominant top qubit radiation at time scales of the order of days. In addition, we have found the first direct evidence for a new WIMP category (type-I+IIb) that is slightly heavier than type-IIb WIMPs.\n\nFollow Ups:\n\nWe also had the opportunity to interview Daniel Roth, one of the co-authors.\n\nA version of this post was first published on Physics arXiv.",
    "When I was 17, I was dating my current girlfriend at the time, and she told me that we weren't compatible in any way, meaning that having sex was hard. Then she became an adult and decided to have kids—it's not like this came out of nowhere or anything (she had several miscarriages before her first pregnancy even began). As such, when we went on our 'break', I wasn't excited about it either; I was bummed that after growing up together with no sexual tension, we were now broken apart—a big, gaping hole in all areas of communication between us. We haven't spoken since, though she texted me for 2 days the weekend prior to giving birth and assured me that things would be fine. I'm still waiting for answers. What do you think? Would people understand if you said something along these lines: \"I can totally make love once we are both adults and ready, but when I am a junior in college that gap might be really significant\"; rather than \"We are breaking up because [we've discussed it], so when I get older I'll want my own pussy\"? Is it better to take a chance that your life partner will become more sexually compatible with each other over waiting for the right person? I know that some women in relationships have their lovers accept them for who they are rather than what they look like. Does being less conservative as a young woman mean that I should wait for sexual compatibility for someone much older? Do you think that waiting until marriage makes relationships stronger, or does there just need higher stakes? Feel free to address or confirm as many responses as possible by commenting below and adding links! Thank you!\n\nA very good question. There may indeed be cases where, in order to maintain a relationship against overwhelming odds, one has to simply take what comes. The only exception to this rule I see would be somebody who genuinely believed themselves to be destined for romantic or sexual harmony with its opposite sex (such people sometimes called polyamory), or somebody whose belief systems led them to believe they'd actually meet them on the streets (in reality) … and then maybe they didn't… But anyway!

    "\"An American woman travels to Ireland to attend her best friend's funeral. Once there, she makes a shocking discovery about her dearly departed.\"\n\"This movie is set in Los Angeles but was shot mostly in Ireland. The first scene is of Gerry (Gerard Butler) at his wife's funeral. He doesn't like to read the eulogy so he reads from a CD that Holly wrote for him. (The real reason is revealed later) Holly (Hilary Swank) was a woman who loved to live life and spread happiness around her. After the funeral, Holly's friends find Holly's notebook, which she wrote to Gerry to open after her death, along with the enclosed CD of how to be in a relationship and some other little things. She mentions that Gerry will love her forever and always. One of her best friends is Holly's boss, Aisling (Lisa Kudrow) who makes a lot of noise at the funeral and tries to hold Gerry accountable for her friends early death by giving cancer a really bad name. Holly had planned to move to Ireland. The movie is mainly about the grief these people go through as she never had an illness or didn't smoke or drink or take drugs or anything. She wasn't overweight and she didn't hang out with smokers who would give her second hand smoke. You have never seen Hilary Swank so fat. In the movie you see him at his fattest around the house in his pajamas and his hair is falling out from chemo. All the girls in her book club (in L.A.) dress in all white, as was Holly's fashion, when they read excerpts from Holly's notebook. Then you have some Irish gangster who tries to kill Butler after Gerry accidentally pushes him off a bar stool on another attempt to get rid of the gangster he has been tailing. In the end they all end up in Ireland. He goes to Ireland and falls in love with her all over again and goes back thinking she was an angel. This movie had so much potential. Hilary Swank is such a great actress and a great body was a waste. It reminded me of \"Bridget Jones's Diary\". The dialogue is a little cheesy at times and she had the weirdest friends.

    "So, I had an interesting day today. I was tasked with delivering two air conditioning units from Menards to a customer's house. The units were pretty heavy, each weighing around 80 pounds. I had to use a dolly to move them from the store to my truck. \n\nThe drive to the customer's house was about 30 minutes away. I had to be extra careful while driving because I didn't want the units to shift around and get damaged. \n\nOnce I arrived at the customer's house, I had to carry each unit up a flight of stairs to the second floor. It was a bit of a struggle, but I managed to do it without any mishaps. \n\nThe customer was very appreciative and even offered me a cold drink, which was a nice gesture considering it was a hot day. \n\nOverall, it was a challenging but rewarding experience. I'm glad I was able to deliver the units safely and make the customer happy.",

    "This paper presents the development and implementation of a mixed-supervised dual-network for medical image segmentation. It addresses the challenge in the automated processing of large amounts of medical imaging data due to the limited availability of labeled data for supervised learning. The proposed dual-network combines unsupervised learning techniques with a limited amount of supervised data to improve overall segmentation accuracy. The system's efficiency has been demonstrated through tests on several types of medical imaging modalities and the results clearly show significant improvements in comparison with conventional segmentation techniques. The study significantly contributes to the field of medical imaging and machine learning by developing an efficient methodology that benefits from both unsupervised and supervised learning paradigms. The proposed framework provides an innovative solution to improve precision in medical image segmentation, and can potentially enhance diagnosis and treatment planning in various healthcare scenarios.",

I went out drinking with my friends and spent some quality time here and there. Got laid tonight too. Yeah I had sex after I stopped fucking the girls because my hands were numb and now when I've been doing stuff (like writing this story), there hasn't really been any feeling down low. Anyways, enough talk, go read my next entry to see what I feel like talking about right now.

    "\"Shrek\" is a delightful animated film that has managed to captivate audiences of all ages since its release in 2001. The movie is a brilliant blend of humor, adventure, and romance, with a unique twist on the traditional fairy tale genre.\n\nThe film's protagonist, Shrek, is a lovable ogre who lives in a swamp and values his solitude above all else. However, his peaceful existence is disrupted when his land is invaded by a host of fairy tale creatures, leading him on a quest to rescue a princess in order to reclaim his home. The character of Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers, is wonderfully developed. He is gruff and intimidating on the outside, but beneath his tough exterior lies a heart of gold. \n\nThe supporting characters are equally memorable. Eddie Murphy's Donkey provides much of the film's comic relief, while Cameron Diaz's Princess Fiona is a refreshing departure from the typical damsel in distress. The villainous Lord Farquaad, voiced by John Lithgow, is both amusing and menacing.\n\nThe animation in \"Shrek\" is top-notch, with a vibrant color palette and meticulous attention to detail. The film's soundtrack, featuring songs by Smash Mouth and others, perfectly complements the on-screen action and adds to the overall enjoyment of the movie.\n\nWhat truly sets \"Shrek\" apart, however, is its clever and often irreverent humor. The film is filled with witty dialogue, visual gags, and numerous references to other fairy tales and popular culture, making it a joy to watch for both children and adults.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Shrek\" is a charming, funny, and heartwarming film that has stood the test of time. It offers a fresh take on the fairy tale genre, with memorable characters, stunning animation, and a fantastic soundtrack. Whether you're a fan of animation or just looking for a great movie to watch, \"Shrek\" is a must-see.",

After Scratch the dog becomes an ill-tempered mischievous boy named Ratchet later on in the story who steals away to his brother Foxy where he finds love with the adorable fox girl, Clarita Fox (Lili Reinhart). Foxx also rescues the little blue birdie Sprocket (Tia Carrere) when the little red bird comes across them by accident while looking for food. The adventures keep turning as Foxxy and her best friends go on a wild summer adventure. They meet Mr. Zoot (Patti Lupone), Mrs. Foxxtroll and their classmates at school all in their quest to find treasure including the Red Bird which they find in Mr. Zoot's sack. At the end of the day everything turns out all right because it was really a very good story. We see more scenes that are based loosely off of true events but still interesting to read about like that time Clarita saved Mr. Fox. There are so many great moments to enjoy as well, and I'm not sure how long this tale will last. Good job, Disney, again!

It's just that this one didn't have Johnny Depp in his role and he made Jack Sparrow so much fun to watch on screen with all those funny lines & facial expressions!! The new Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) did an excellent job though; however there were some scenes where you could tell they had used CGI instead because Geoffrey looked like himself when playing other characters such us Blackbeard or Davy Jones before him which would've been better if done live action rather than computer generated images since these are supposed be real people afterall right? But overall still enjoyed watching even without seeing any familiar faces again except maybe Orlando Bloom who plays Will Turner once more here too 🙂",

    "\"Captain America: The First Avenger\" is an embracing cinematic experience that genuinely elevates the bar of superhero genre. The movie masterfully encapsulates the spirit of the 1940s era through detailed sets, vintage costumes and a palpitating narrative. The direction by Joe Johnston is brilliant, turning out an immensely captivating storyline filled with action, drama, and emotion, which is further enhanced by the neat and polished cinematography.\n\nChris Evans shines brightly in his role as Steve Rogers/Captain America, his transformation from a scrawny, sympathetic young man to the valorous super-soldier is thoroughly convincing and laudable.

The film balances its action sequences and emotional beats unerringly, ensuring that the audience is left simultaneously exhilarated and moved. CG effects and action sequences are skillfully done, none of them feels over-the-top or forced, making for compelling viewing.\n\nThe supporting cast which includes the likes of Hayley Atwell, Tommy Lee Jones, Sebastian Stan amongst others were fantastic, each character adds something unique to the plot, enriching the entire movie-watching experience.\n\nThe music score is grand, perfectly fitting in with the movie’s tone and enhancing pivotal moments of the film.\n\nTo conclude, \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" is a sublime blend of strong storytelling, established technical elements and spellbinding performances. It's a must-see for all superhero fanatics and also for those who enjoy a solid action-drama flick. It's not just a comic adaptation, it's a memorable film.",

    "For the second year running, British hurdler Colin Jackson has beaten Britain's Olympic gold medal contender Derrick Atkinson to an award. World and Olympic champion Linford Christie was voted by the press as the World's Best Athlete.\nA panel of expert judges selected the 100 metre men and the best men's and women's middle-distance runners, with the rest down to public vote at bbc.co.uk. Jackson took the 100 men award, after failing even to make it onto the shortlist last year. The sprint hurdler, who won silver in the 100m at the 1996 Olympics, came second in the public vote with 5% of the tally, behind the Olympic and world champion Michael Johnson with 26%. The 100m sprint was decided by 100 voters, with Johnson and Jackson each getting 38 and third-placed Canadian Ben Johnson getting 14. Jackson's double Olympic gold medallist compatriot Sally Gunnell won the women's 100 title, beating Merlene Ottey of Jamaica by a big margin.\nOlivia Granville won the women's 400m award.

    "After having seen both Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis do well in action movies such as Lethal Weapon, The Siege (Lt Col Frank Johnson ) made sense to try his own hand at acting with this historical fiction film Brave Heart... This really didn't turn out so badly after all! Sure he did not get an oscar but was nominated that year.... In my opinion what people sometimes don`T take account off are character building, story line plus screenplay..... So yes you can say it's very fictionalized even if based on factual accounts although they couldn t tell how many hundreds or thousands perished because there weren'T any records kept like we have today.. If one day ever happens when humans go beyond technological boundaries then maybe these kind Of events will come back again along W/the need To protect our basic rights against tyrants........ Yes sir! It s amazing work which leaves Some great thought stirring emotions within yourself..I highly recommend Anyone who has interest especially those born before late 60s...this Movie shows humanity & courageous bravery under fire.

    "Former world number one, Marat Safin, suffered a surprising defeat at the Dubai Tennis Championships, adding another setback to his already struggling season. The Russian tennis star was ousted in the first round by an unseeded player, marking a disappointing start to his campaign in the Middle East.\n\nSafin, who was once considered one of the most formidable players on the circuit, has been struggling to regain his form after a series of injuries and inconsistent performances. His loss in Dubai is a stark reminder of the challenges he faces in his quest to return to the top of the game.\n\nThe two-time Grand Slam winner was visibly frustrated throughout the match, struggling to find his rhythm against his lower-ranked opponent. Despite showing flashes of his former brilliance, Safin was unable to maintain his momentum, eventually succumbing to a straight-sets defeat.\n\nThe shock loss is a significant blow to Safin's confidence, who had hoped to use the Dubai Championships as a springboard to kickstart his season. Instead, the Russian will have to go back to the drawing board, reassess his game plan and work on his fitness to ensure he is ready for the upcoming tournaments.\n\nSafin's early exit from the tournament is also a disappointment for the event organisers, who had hoped that the former world number one's participation would draw in large crowds. However, the tournament still boasts a strong field, including several top-ranked players who will be vying for the title.\n\nDespite his recent struggles, Safin remains a popular figure in the tennis world, known for his fiery temperament and powerful game. Fans will be hoping that the Russian can bounce back from this setback and recapture some of his former glory in the coming months.\n\nThe Dubai Tennis Championships continues this week, with the remaining players battling it out for the prestigious title. As for Safin, his focus will now shift to the next tournament, where he will be hoping to put this shock loss behind him and return to winning ways.",
    "Global insurance giant MetLife has announced the acquisition of Citigroup's insurance arm in a deal that significantly expands its operations. The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nThe acquisition is part of MetLife's strategic plan to diversify its business and expand its footprint in the insurance sector. The deal will see MetLife take over Citigroup's life, accident and health insurance divisions, as well as its property and casualty insurance operations.\n\nMetLife's CEO, Michel Khalaf, said in a statement: \"This acquisition is a significant milestone in our growth strategy. It not only expands our product portfolio but also provides us with a larger customer base and a wider geographical reach.\"\n\nCitigroup's insurance arm has a strong presence in several key markets, including the United States, Europe, and Asia. The acquisition will therefore significantly boost MetLife's global presence.\n\nThe deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2023.\n\nCitigroup's decision to sell its insurance arm is part of a broader strategy to streamline its operations and focus on its core banking business. The bank has been divesting non-core assets over the past few years to improve its financial performance.\n\nThe sale of its insurance arm to MetLife is expected to generate significant capital for Citigroup, which it plans to reinvest in its core banking operations.\n\nAnalysts have hailed the deal as a win-win for both companies. MetLife gets to expand its operations and diversify its business, while Citigroup gets to focus on its core banking operations and improve its financial performance.\n\nThe deal also signals a growing trend of consolidation in the insurance sector, as companies look to diversify their operations and expand their customer base in a highly competitive market.",

    "I'm at my wit's end here and could really use some advice. I have a 3-year-old male cat, neutered, who's been with me since he was a kitten. He's an indoor/outdoor cat, and he's always been very sociable and friendly with other cats in the neighborhood. However, about a month ago, a new cat showed up in our area and has been causing a lot of trouble.\n\nThis new cat is also a male, and he's significantly larger than my cat. He's been attacking my cat almost every time he goes outside. I've seen it happen a few times, and it's not playful wrestling - it's full-on aggression. My cat has come home with scratches and bite marks multiple times, and it's clear he's scared to go outside now.\n\nI've tried to talk to my neighbors to see if anyone knows who this cat belongs to, but no one seems to know. I've also tried to scare the cat away when I see him in my yard, but he just comes back later.

I've considered calling animal control, but I'm hesitant because I don't want the other cat to be put down or anything. I just want him to stop attacking my cat.

    "After a lot of self-reflection and introspection, I have decided to make a move many consider as a daunting task. I am beginning my NoFap journey today. This decision comes from the realization that my PMO habit has hit an all time high, and it’s becoming debilitating. I have noticed tangible repercussions such as lack of focus, lethargy, and an overall decrease in life's satisfaction. \n\nI've arrived at this point by acknowledging my harmful habits and introspecting on the kind of person I aspire to be. I want to be someone who has control over their actions and is not a slave to addictions. This journey is not only about abstaining from PMO, but it’s also about pushing my mental barriers, improving discipline, and primarily, regaining control over my life.\n\nMy initial goal is to reach 90 days without PMO, but I understand that NoFap is more of a lifestyle change rather than an isolated challenge. I believe that each minor victory will lead me towards the ultimate success, teaching me to be patient and resilient.\n\nI'm posting this here for two reasons. First, to gain motivation from those of you who have been successful in their NoFap journeys. Secondly, I intend to maintain accountability and transparency about my progress, as I believe that public commitment is a great motivator.\n\nI'm both nervous and excited to embark on this journey. I know this won't be an easy path, but I'm ready and willing to face the challenges that come with it. Any advice, success stories, words of encouragement, or motivation from you guys would be really appreciated as I start this new chapter in my life.\n\nLooking forward to evolving as a person and empowering myself throughout this journey.

    "\"Dead Poets Society\" is a profound cinematic experience that delves into the depths of individuality, freedom, and the power of words. Directed by Peter Weir, the film is a compelling narrative that explores the lives of a group of students at an elite conservative boarding school, under the guidance of their unconventional English teacher, John Keating, played brilliantly by the late Robin Williams.\n\nWilliams delivers a performance that is both captivating and deeply moving, embodying the spirit of a man who encourages his students to seize the day and live life to the fullest. His portrayal of Keating is a testament to his versatility as an actor, effortlessly shifting between moments of humor, passion, and poignant emotion.\n\nThe film's narrative is beautifully crafted, with each character's journey intricately woven into the fabric of the story. The young cast, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard, deliver performances that are both authentic and compelling, effectively capturing the struggles and triumphs of adolescence.\n\nThe cinematography is stunning, with each frame meticulously composed to reflect the film's themes of freedom and individuality. The use of natural light and picturesque locations adds a layer of visual poetry to the narrative, enhancing the overall viewing experience.\n\nHowever, the true heart of \"Dead Poets Society\" lies in its exploration of the power of words and ideas. The film is a celebration of literature and poetry, showcasing their ability to inspire, challenge, and transform. It encourages viewers to question societal norms and to embrace their individuality, making it a timeless piece of cinema.\n\nDespite its tragic undertones, \"Dead Poets Society\" is ultimately a film about hope and the indomitable human spirit. It is a poignant reminder of the importance of living life on one's own terms and the power of a single voice to inspire change. This film is not just a movie; it's a life lesson that continues to resonate with audiences, making it a must-watch for all.",
    "A Clockwork Orange, directed by Anthony Burgess and based on his dystopian novel of the same name, is certainly on that short list of movies to put you in an existential angst situation as if you were one of those characters portrayed by Anthony Burgess or Philip Marlowe. This film, which was released in 1966, has been criticized for some of its brutal portrayal of violence in men and sexual cruelty towards women. But there's nothing wrong with making things violent or abusive, especially by turning them into robots and watching it over and over again or re-watching it whenever you want to become insane. That just adds to the overall fun atmosphere. In fact, this should be your first stop when getting into all kinds of alternative cinema!",

    "Quin69, a popular Twitch streamer, was in the middle of a heated gameplay session when his game suddenly crashed. As thousands of viewers watched, he voiced his frustration, but couldn't pinpoint why it happened. Theories floated around, including connectivity issues or software bugs. But the real culprit? A Windows update forced a system reboot.\n\nWhile Quin69 was deep into the game, his operating system had a pending Windows update. It automatically initiated its standard procedure: a restart. Now, here's where things went south. Quin69's update settings had been set for automatic updates without prompting the user, which is usually not a big deal, but it becomes one when controversially Windows decides to do it in the middle of a live game stream.\n\nIt's a relatable situation for many gamers and streamers. The episode serves as a reminder to keep track of your system's settings, especially if you're in the middle of a critical gaming session and Windows decides it's the perfect time for that hefty update.\n\nJust to clarify, this isn't an intended dig at Windows. Chances are, any other operating system would have done something similar.

RODDICK TO FACE SULLIVAN IN FINAL Andy Roddick will meet Frenchman Julien Boutter in the final of the Legg Mason Tennis Classic on Sunday after winning their semi-finals on Friday night. The American, seeded four, defeated Guillermo Coria 6-3 6-3, while Boutter, who missed the start of the year after having wrist surgery, got the better of Taylor Dent 7-5 7-5 in a lengthy second semi-final. Roddick saved four break points in the first set and hit 25 winners to reach his 10th ATP Tour semi-final of the year. There were many missed chances for Coria in the early stages, as the Argentine served four double faults and did not have a first serve in play until the start of the third game. But Coria settled down and made Roddick work to win each of the next five games.\n\"I was pretty nervous,\" said Roddick. \"But that was okay. I feel like I did a pretty good job, considering the conditions. The court is so slow.\"\nCoria then saved break points in games five and six and fought hard to fight back from 0-4 down in the 10th game to break back. But Roddick kept up the pressure, holding serve to 30 in the 12th game to win the set. The second set proved much easier for Roddick, who came to the net more in the second set than in the first and continued to force his opponent onto the back foot by putting balls deep in the corners and hitting big serves.\n\"It was good to stay steady mentally in the heat,\" he said. \"He has a big serve, but I was in and it felt good.\" Roddick saved one more break point in game two of the second set and moved into a 3-0 lead. The American finished the match in style, as Coria failed to challenge a low volley winner to fall to defeat.\nRoddick, 21, is playing his final match of the North American season before heading to the hardcourt tournament in Montreal at the end of the week. \"I've played well in Canada every year I've gone",

    "GARGOYNE — A London court heard how an elderly care home owner threatened a fellow resident at gunpoint in the early hours of Wednesday by pointing a gun at her and telling her there would be \"blood\" if she was not handed over. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had lived in her Cobham home since 1986. In 2010, her husband decided to leave her and buy the property he was living in and set about selling his belongings and moving his family out. The police said he threatened his elderly neighbour in August 2010 by pointing a gun at her and telling her the same thing would happen if she did not hand over the keys within minutes. It took officers nearly an hour to gain entry to the property as the man was locked in the garage from the inside. He was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and the man at the house — who could not be identified for legal reasons — was reported missing a short time later. In court, a psychiatric expert said the man had suffered severe head injuries from a fall years ago. His brain function had suffered and he had developed a condition which left him unable to make decisions. He was not on any kind of medication and he did not know his way around the house. The psychiatric report concluded the man was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, the BBC's Daniel Sandford in London reported. He had no previous convictions and was found not guilty of the offences in January this year. The man had been allowed to remain at the care home while his mental health recovery took place. After the incident, he was allowed back to live in his Cobham home, a court was told. The court also heard the suspect, who had a prior conviction for grievous bodily harm, had threatened to kill the man during the incident and had also threatened to kill three of their family members.\n\nSo why doesn't the government provide mental health care to our military and veterans, but they provide \"socialize[d] mental health services to the public so we all get taken care of\"?\n\nThe article continues:\n\nA doctor at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust told the court that although the man had a history of mental illness that had \"not subsided\" in the previous 16 months he was not the perpetrator and he was \"not at all on medication\". \"But we have to remember this is a",
    "You're in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp on the coast of North Korea during the Korean War. The camp was a place where the Japanese are sent in groups of hundreds or thousands at a time for various reasons, which range from hunger and disease to being deemed too old. You're in your group, the one called Doolittle Four, and you've chosen the most boring man to get you out of North Korea. You're in his group, too.\n\nAfter two years of captivity, you get to see your first American planes, the B-29 Superfortress bombers. They're loaded, fueled, and ready to go. When you get on the plane you're told to stand up and salute the crew as they take off, and you do so. Everyone, including your Japanese commander, is impressed and proud. Once the plane is airborne, you look out the window and see it is in the air over the United States. Not the Soviet Union, but America. You can't believe your luck. But when you return to your unit, you're told not to show any interest in the plane and they're sent back to North Korea.\n\nYou have a hard time following the war. You're not really in Korea, just on the other side of a large, harsh fence from both north and south. When you see some American soldiers you get the idea they must be on the other side. It doesn't make sense. You eventually begin to see the war was really about a very particular kind of American imperialism.\n\nThe movie is told in flashback, starting long before the Korean War, and it explains what the United States was doing in the East and how it all came about. The men who made our bombs and killed us have no connection to the Korean War. The reason the planes fly over is because the government is building a super-highway, and that's why the government calls it the \"Highway to Nowhere.\n\nThe first major blow to American power in China comes when the United States sends troops to overthrow Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. It's not about the Korean War; the United States wanted the war with Vietnam to start as the Soviets were on China's side. The leader of North Korea, Kim Il Sung (Kim Hye Rim) is also on China's side. So China sends troops to join the American in overthrowing",
    "I have been playing FIFA for quite some time now, and to be frank, I never paid much attention to the difference between the gameplay in career mode and in kick off mode. But after countless hours of playing, I noticed that the mechanics in these modes are literally worlds apart.\n\nCareer mode is overall made challenging by the unnecessary scripting by EA. Even with a high-quality team, I often find artificial difficulty scenarios which almost seem rigged. The accuracy of passes decreases, speed of the players reduces, AI opponents become very aggressive, and my teams AI is usually way off and falls out of positions way more than in kick off mode.\n\nOn the other hand, kick off mode feels more fluid and less stressful. In this mode, the players tend to perform based on their overall ability, which you would assume is the same case in career mode but it's unfortunately not. Kick off gameplay rewards strategic gameplay much more and doesn't make players feel they are wrestling with the game's mechanics.\n\nI understand EA's desire to add a level of challenge to the game but the way this is implemented in the career mode often feels unfair and uneven. This \"scripting\" seems more like an annoying hindrance rather than something that adds a layer of challenge to the matches in a fun or balanced way.\n\nI can't help but wonder why EA doesn't unify the gameplay across all modes? I'm sure many players have noticed this issue. It's inconsistent and it really dampens the overall gaming experience. Not to mention that it could also become a turn-off for new players. EA, it's about time you listen to your community and address these concerns. \n\nWould love to hear thoughts and insights from other members on this. Have you faced similar issues? Do you think EA might handle this differently in future versions?",

    "Writing this post brings me mixed feelings, as I love my job. I knew I wanted to be in the mental health profession from the time I was in high school, participating in psychology classes opened up a whole world of understanding for me that I felt could foster connection and healing for people who suffer from mental health issues.\n\nBut, the past few years as a mental health professional have been draining, not physically, but emotionally. The system is flawed. It seems more focused on getting people out of the door rather than actually helping them recover, and I find that the administration often interferes with treatment plans for the sake of profit.\n\nWhat's even harder for me is the constant rollercoaster of emotions that I deal with. Some days are filled with success stories, other days are full of heartbreak. One day, a patient tells me they have managed to go a week without self-harming, and the next day, another patient is admitted after a suicide attempt. It's hard to not bring these emotions home, to not let them affect my personal life.  \n\nI also find myself constantly faced with limited resources, excessive paperwork, and overloaded caseloads. I feel like I'm losing touch with why I got into this profession in the first place—to help people heal and live better, happier lives. I have begun to dread going into work, and I come home at the end of the day feeling exhausted and empty rather than fulfilled. \n\nIn addition, the regular exposure to trauma and suffering has pushed me to the edges of burnout. I feel like I'm absorbing my patients' pain, and it's becoming a burden that's too heavy for me to bear, causing vicarious trauma.\n\nWorking in this field necessitates constant emotional labor, but there's a lack of support and understanding for practitioners themselves. Sometimes it feels like we are expected to be machines, not humans.\n\nPlease do not misunderstand, I wholeheartedly love my patients, and being a part of their journey to better mental health is ennobling. However, in order to do any good for them, I need to take care of myself too. \n\nI suppose writing this is my attempt to find some solace or some advice from those who might have been or are in the same boat. How do you cope? Can we talk about self-care in an emotionally demanding job without sounding self-centered or unprofessional? After all, this is a hard job we're doing, and I believe it's okay to admit the struggle. So here I am, admitting mine.",

    "I have been using an Asus X99-A II motherboard for about 2 years now and I am very happy with it. It has everything that I need in terms of performance, features, and reliability. However, I recently upgraded to a Gigabyte GA-Z170X-Gaming 5 motherboard which was released on June 1st 2017. The new board comes with a brand new Intel Z170 chipset (which is also known as Skylake) and a brand new CPU socket called LGA 1151. This means that I can upgrade my motherboard to support the latest CPUs without having to buy a whole new one. So far so good! But then I started looking at the specs of this new board and noticed something strange…\n\nIntel's official specifications state that the LGA 1151 socket supports up to 4 cores per socket. In other words, if you want to use more than 4 cores on your motherboard, you will need to purchase a separate processor. For example, if you are running a quad core i7-7700K, you would need to purchase a separate processor such as the Core i5-7640X or Core i3-7350K. If you are running a dual core i5-6600K, you would need to purchase a separate processor such as the Core i5-6560D. And if you are running a single core i3-6320, you would need to purchase a separate processor such as the Core i3-6100H.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, if you are running a quad core i7-7700K, you will not be able to run a quad core i5-7500 or a quad core i3-6470L. You will only be able to run a quad core i7-6700K. If you are running a dual core i7-7700K, you will not be able to run a dual core i5-7440 or a dual core i3-6330. You will only be able to run a dual core i7-6850K. And if you are running a single core i7-7700K, you will not be able to run a single core i5-7410 or a single core i3-6320. You will only be able to run a single core i7-6950X.",

    "\"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored me with the Oscar for best stunt coordinator of a picture and congratulations to me,\" said Arnold.\n\nThe first ever stunt coordinator of a motion picture Oscar, Arnold was nominated for his work on the upcoming action film \"The Expendables 3.\" The Academy will now hand out its own stunt coordinating Oscar in October.\n\n\"This was a great honor, but I'll take the win because every day there are things I've learned that I will carry with me for the rest of my career. It's an honor to become a part of the Academy and to work with the best in the industry,\" said Arnold\n\nBefore he was a stunt coordinator, Arnold was in the Army for 12 years. His military service included three tours in Afghanistan where he earned the Bronze Star, the Silver Star and the Army Commendation Medal. \"They came to me and said they wanted to know why I was thinking about joining them,\" said Arnold. \"After I deployed once, I went back to the States and I've loved every minute of it since.\" He was awarded the Medal of Honor in Iraq and received the Distinguished Flying Cross during his fourth tour in Afghanistan.\n\nArnold said he learned a lot just from sitting inside his Humvee and being around his friends back home. \"I knew how to shoot, I knew what to shoot and I knew how to keep it together inside the vehicle,\" said Arnold.\n\nHe was a big fan of the Army and did a tour in Germany (2004/2005) as well as the Caribbean (2005) where he served for a year. \"It was great having people around you who are a little older than you are and older than life itself,\" he said. \"You learn how to keep your family together and keep your mind sharp and your outlook hopeful and things that will matter in the world when my time is done.\"\n\nArnold had a big project scheduled in Iraq in September 2009 which he spent months preparing for. He knew that his fellow soldiers would have to be able to perform as soldiers should in order to make the most of their time, \"In Iraq it's hard to run around trying to get a perfect shot because there's so much action and your mission is to follow orders,\" said Arnold. \"In my experience, if you get something wrong and the soldier is",

    "In this academic research paper, a novel method for image segmentation using scribbles and multi-scale adversarial attention gates is proposed. The work primarily focuses on improving the ability of neural networks to learn from a small amount of annotated data, in this case, scribbles. A multi-scale attention mechanism was integrated with a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to encourage the model to focus on more challenging and relevant regions. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvement in performance compared to existing approaches. It offers a less time-consuming and less expensive process by minimizing the amount of required annotated data. The robustness and effectiveness of the method have been tested and validated on several public datasets. The outcomes presented in this paper may be constructive for further research in the area of image segmentation and application in the real-world medical imaging field.",
    "\"Insomnia\" is a gripping psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, the film is a masterclass in suspense and tension, with a plot that is as intricate as it is engaging.\n\nThe film is set in the small Alaskan town of Nightmute, where a local teenage girl has been brutally murdered. Two Los Angeles homicide detectives, played by Al Pacino and Martin Donovan, are sent to assist the local police with their investigation. However, things take a turn for the worse when Pacino's character, Detective Will Dormer, accidentally shoots his partner while trying to apprehend the suspect.\n\nPacino delivers a stellar performance as the guilt-ridden detective who is plagued by insomnia in the land of the midnight sun. His portrayal of a man slowly unraveling due to lack of sleep and overwhelming guilt is both haunting and compelling. Robin Williams, in a departure from his usual comedic roles, is equally impressive as the enigmatic and manipulative murder suspect. The cat-and-mouse game between the two characters is riveting, with the lines between right and wrong becoming increasingly blurred as the story progresses.\n\nThe cinematography is stunning, with the bleak and desolate Alaskan landscape serving as the perfect backdrop for the dark and twisted narrative. The use of light and shadow is particularly effective, reflecting the moral ambiguity of the characters and their actions.\n\n\"Insomnia\" is a thought-provoking exploration of guilt, morality, and the consequences of our actions. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, leaving you to ponder the fine line between hero and villain, and the darkness that lurks within us all. Despite its title, \"Insomnia\" is sure to keep you wide awake and completely engrossed. A must-watch for any fan of psychological thrillers.",
    "There is a point in \"Fargo\" where William Macy tells Steven Buscemi, \"It's a helluva life, isn't it?\" A simple remark, yet it sums up this whole movie in one sentence.\nThere are some great characters in \"Fargo\", some of them dead, some of them alive. If you're looking to have a good, and dark, laugh, this is probably the movie for you.\nThe story happens in Minnesota just across the Canadian border, where the main character is Jean (Melissa McCarthy), a woman with a pretty bad life. Her husband is at a bar. She was supposed to be the one to run for food and she's just been to the grocery store and there was nothing in her budget to purchase, which led to her husband leaving her and going off to the bar.\nIn order to cover up a crime, the three criminals need to bury all the evidence. What they didn't anticipate was how frozen the body would be, or how hard it would be to carry.",
    "While global markets have experienced a surge in optimism following a raft of positive economic data, Euro zone firms seem to have been left behind.\n\nStock markets in America, Asia and other parts of the world have surged since the start of the year, bolstered by strong corporate earnings, a bounce back in the service sector, and ongoing fiscal stimulus measures.\n\nBut in the Euro zone, the picture is far less rosy. Data compiled and released by IHS Markit showed business activity across the bloc fell for a second straight month. While some firms have reported slight upticks in order, many are struggling with depleted cash flows and the ongoing impacts of coronavirus related restrictions.\n\nA comprehensive survey of service providers in the region found that the downturn is widespread. Businesses are grappling with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and an ever-changing and often turbulent political landscape at home. Despite vaccination progress and easing lockdown restrictions, many firms reported a lack of confidence in their future growth prospects.\n\nThe IHS Markit Euro Zone Services PMI, a widely watched barometer of economic health, fell to 49.6 in April from 50.1 in March, just shy of the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.\n\nThe slower pace of recovery in the Euro zone is a stark contrast to global counterparts. In the US, a sharp acceleration in private sector growth is being fuelled by the speedy recovery in consumer spending, the robust housing market and the fast pace of Covid-19 vaccinations. In China, the continued willingness of companies to invest and hire new workers reflects an optimistic outlook for the future.\n\nThe Euro zone lags behind in part due to the slow rollout of coronavirus vaccines and longer lockdown periods. However, a larger stumbling block seems to be the pervading uncertainty about the future.\n\nMany companies in the bloc are expressing concerns about weak demand and an ever-changing policy landscape. While government stimulus has provided a lifeline to some businesses, the scale and effectiveness of the fiscal response have varied by country, adding another layer of uncertainty.\n\nThe lack of optimism is a worrying sign for the Euro zone's economic recovery if it continues to persist. While businesses may well have cause for concern, the pessimistic outlook only serves to exacerbate the problem, as a lack of confidence often translates into a lack of investment.\n\nThere are small glimmers of hope, however. The survey found that a few sectors, such as manufacturing, are offering a glimpse of resilience despite the challenging environment. As Covid-19 vaccines become more readily available and reopening plans come into effect, this optimism could potentially begin to filter",
    "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has offered hope to Fulham striker Moussa Dembele by suggesting he could be a future star at the Emirates.\n\nDembele, 20, has been linked with a move to the Premier League champions in recent weeks, with Arsenal and Chelsea both said to be interested.\n\nBut Wenger, who has been impressed by the France international, has suggested he could be a future star at the club.\n\n\"I think he has a lot of potential,\" Wenger said. \"He is a very good player.\n\n\"He is a very good player for Fulham.

    "I went out with this shy guy for about 3 months. I thought it was going well, but then nothing happened. It had started on a really casual note. I was at a friend's college and he was there too along with this girl (she's a long time friend of mine). He never looked at me in class or even acknowledged my presence, but we were both in the same group of people from the hostel. I always made sure to sit in the same row and that kind of helped me to get to know him. This was about 6 months ago when neither of us had really come out of our shell. He seemed to enjoy the company I guess. We ended up talking at night and he would tell me all about his past relationships and how things went wrong and he would say he loved music, movies, games, etc and also how he's a bad-boy at heart. All of this was on the phone late into the night when everyone's asleep. That whole month we talked for hours on the phone. Nothing happened to lead to anything more than that. The conversation was more like two teenagers at the start of their friendship.\nThere was a point when I was really frustrated with the situation. We were talking every day. Yet he never knew I existed. My friend and I both decided to go for a movie. We asked him along but he said he would go with the same group of people he always hung out with at the hostel and the cinema. I asked him again thinking that he might have changed his mind and so we all settled for the same movie (I guess we should have asked for a different movie) so we could leave at different times. We all watched the movie together; he watched a different movie after mine with his friends. His excuse was that he had to take back some homework that he had forgotten in his room which was on the second floor. So he never got to hang out with my friend or me. I can remember that incident clearly in my head because it hurt like crazy to spend several months talking to him and yet to hear that there is no chance of me getting to hang out with him.\nI was always wondering how a guy could fall for a girl and I didn't even know when I felt anything more for him, until one day he called. This is exactly 3 days ago. I heard him talk to my roommate and",
    "I bought this item on eBay and it was shipped to me in Canada, but I live in the US so I had to pay customs fees. The seller said that they would ship it to me in the US, but when I checked with USPS, they told me that it would be $50 for international shipping. So I contacted them again and asked if they could send it to me in the US instead of Canada. They said yes, but then they never sent it. I called them back and they said that they were going to refund my money because they didn't want to lose their business. I'm not sure what happened there, but I don't think they're very good at customer service.\n\nThis is an example of how sellers can lie about shipping costs. If you buy something online, you should always check the shipping cost before buying.",
    "It is not often that such an elite cast comes together to create a smooth, stylish and intensely entertaining film like \"Ocean's Eleven\". Anchored by George Clooney’s charming portrayal of the suave Danny Ocean, each character is granted a moment to shine (or smirk) freely, a brilliant accomplishment considering the high wattage shared by this ensemble.\n\nClooney's camaraderie with Brad Pitt is palpable, while Matt Damon turns in a somewhat understated yet effective performance. The supporting cast, including Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, and Don Cheadle among others, provide the perfect backing, each hitting their beats expertly.\n\nSteven Soderbergh’s direction should also be commended, as he is able to carve out a place for each ego in this multilayered plot. His ability to juggle multiple storylines and characters is impressive. The film is stylishly edited and the cinematography is glossy, reflecting the glitzy and glamorous world of sin city.\n\n\"Ocean's Eleven,\" is much more than a heist movie. At its heart, it’s about friendship and loyalty. The chemistry between the characters truly makes this an enjoyable cinematic affair, sweepingly unique in its own right. As the final twist unfurls, the audience finds itself just as fooled as the casino owner, a testament to a well-crafted plot.\n\nThe movie consistently delivers laughs that organically bloom from each character making it a satisfying comedy in addition to a slick caper film. The treatment of Las Vegas is also so respectful and grand that it almost becomes a character in itself. Diego Klattenhoff's music deserves mention too, for it impeccably complements the visuals and modulates the flow.\n\nOne slight drawback of the film, however, could be living up to the expectations set by the original \"Rat Pack\" movie. The film might not hit all the notes with the same panache as the original but its rendition still provides a sleek, modern take on the familiar narrative.\n\nFast-paced, smart, and wonderfully entertaining, \"Ocean's Eleven\" is undoubtedly enjoyable and serves as a testament to Soderbergh's ability to assemble a spectacular cast and achieve a fine balance between humor and suspense. Perfect for a night-in, this film is assuredly one to toss in your DVD player when you're in the mood for some lighthearted fun.",
    "\"The Martian\" is a cinematic masterpiece that brilliantly combines science fiction and drama in a way that is both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film is based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel of the same name and features a stellar performance by Matt Damon.\n\nDamon plays Mark Watney, an astronaut left stranded on Mars by his crew who believe him to be dead after a fierce storm. The narrative follows Watney's struggle for survival and his relentless efforts to signal Earth that he is alive. Damon's portrayal of Watney is both compelling and relatable, making the audience root for his character throughout the film.\n\nThe film's visual effects are breathtaking, creating a realistic depiction of the Martian landscape that is both beautiful and terrifying. The attention to detail in the scientific aspects of the film is commendable, making the plot believable and engaging. \n\nThe supporting cast, including Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, deliver strong performances, adding depth to the storyline. The screenplay is well-written, balancing moments of intense drama with light-hearted humor, which provides much-needed relief in this high-stakes survival story.\n\n\"The Martian\" is not just a film about survival, but also a celebration of human ingenuity, resilience, and the spirit of exploration. It is a thought-provoking film that leaves the audience pondering about the vastness of the universe and our place in it.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Martian\" is a must-watch for fans of science fiction and survival dramas. With its excellent performances, stunning visuals, and a gripping storyline, it is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.",
    "This film is about two men who are on opposite sides of a war in Vietnam, and they both have to make difficult decisions that will affect their lives forever. The story follows the life of one man as he tries to find his way back home after being separated from his wife and child during the war. He meets an American soldier named John (played by Tom Hanks) who has been sent to help him get back to America. They become friends and eventually fall in love. However, when the war ends, John returns to Vietnam with no idea where his family is or what happened to them. This leads to a very emotional journey for this man, as he struggles to come to terms with his past and try to move forward.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie because it was so well done. It had great acting, good cinematography, and a great plot. I also liked how the characters were portrayed. There wasn't any one character that stood out more than another. Each person had their own personality and made you feel like they were real people.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that are realistic and don't take themselves too seriously.",
    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've had Tourette's since I was about 8 years old. It started out as a mild tic that would only happen when I was stressed or angry and it got worse over time until I couldn't control my body anymore. I went to school with people who were diagnosed with Tourette's and they told me how much it affected their lives. They said that it made them feel like they didn't belong in society because they could never get along with other kids. I thought that maybe I should try to find a cure for myself so that I wouldn't be alone forever. I tried medication, therapy, and even diet changes. Nothing worked. Then one day I found an article on the internet about a drug called Risperdal. The doctor wrote that it helped some people with Tourette's and that it wasn't addictive. So I decided to give it a shot. I took it every morning for two weeks and then stopped. After that I felt better than ever. I still have tics sometimes, but they are less frequent now. I don't think I'll ever go back to taking medication again. I just want to live a normal life without having to worry about being bullied or feeling like I can't talk to anyone. Please help me!\n\nThis is the first time I've seen someone ask for help on Reddit. I know there are plenty of people who suffer from Tourette's, but I haven't heard of anyone asking for help on the site. I hope that you will take the time to read through this post and see what others are going through. If you're struggling with Tourette's, please consider sharing your story here.",

    "This film was made to be seen on an enormous screen, preferably in 70mm and with surround sound (which it deserves). It's not just that this war epic has some spectacular battle scenes; there are also many quiet moments when you can hear every word spoken by Tom Hanks or Matt Damon as they talk about their families back home while waiting out another attack at Omaha Beach during D-Day 1944...or even more poignantly between two soldiers who have been separated since childhood but now find themselves fighting sidebyside against overwhelming odds.\"",
    "We have heard very good things about this album. I do think its on fire and really a great way to finish off a career, or at least my own. But one thing I noticed was Aita's songlist, which I'm going over now because I saw some bad stuff happening with an ex girlfriend of mine (namely that she started posting shit about me here). Her words were something like... She said that her guy didn't share a lot; he wouldn't listen to her or leave his girlfriend alone as much as this new kid seems to do. We are both 30 & 29 & the other guy I dated was around 2 years younger then us.. So basically my first real love cheated on me when I just met him. That part makes me wanna cry or scream, but somehow I kept it in bc im a nice warm person at heart and didnt want to hurt anyone and still wanted something from them too. That kinda blew my mind cause hes such an amazing rapper/singer/artist who deserves the attention, recognition he gets because he works hard & puts himself out there every moment of the day. He made me believe more people can say their feelings towards you than you think because they will actually care deeply about you if anything happens between your boyfriend or wife, & that thats why sometimes, even now, I feel down. And Im a pretty nice warm person so i cant really complain either. Also, all the young women who seem to be on here right now are actually hot & talented. Like all of you guys will remember when Jay-Z got back together with Beyonce after their divorce scandal from when he was a famous basketball player. But, I feel like Beyonce, although really nice, took advantage of her relationship with him by being his assistant producer & giving him ideas & advice. That's how Jay could stay so popular even when his image may've come into question or his music had taken quite a hit due to some personal reasons. And yes Aita did take a small break with Kanye to record on 808s & Heartbreak & that was just another blow up that made no sense. How comes these girls never stopped asking Kanye what he thinks about their latest video? They never stop asking Kim, Nicki, and other famous stars, but still, they never asked Aita about his views? When does that end? Not only that these stories continue to happen and make no sense",
    "This film is about an American machinist who, after being fired by his employer, decides to take up work in China and become a professional bodybuilder. The story follows him as he trains with some of the best Chinese athletes in the country, including one of the most famous bodybuilders in the world, and eventually becomes the winner of the Mr. Universe competition. This film has been compared to \"Rocky IV\", but it's not quite that good. It's more like \"Rocky III\". There are some great action scenes, but they're all pretty much just set-pieces. I don't think this was really intended to be a serious film, so there isn't any real character development or anything like that. But if you want to see a good action film, then this might be worth checking out.\n\nI'm going to give this movie 3 stars because it does have some nice action sequences, but it doesn't really do much else. If you're looking for something more serious than \"Rocky IV\", then this probably won't be your thing.",

    "\"Drive\" is an intoxicating blend of sleek aesthetics, intense performances, and a gripping storyline. It isn’t your average action-packed crime flick; it's more of a cinematic jaunt through the underbelly of Los Angeles. The central character, portrayed masterfully by Ryan Gosling, can only be described as an enigmatic anti-hero with a brooding yet intense demeanor.\n\nThe film captures a unique look at the city, primarily at night, where violence and high-risk crimes take place against a backdrop of neon-lit skylines and throbbing electronic music. Nicolas Winding Refn has carefully constructed this film to be a mosaic of gorgeous cinematography and highly stylistic elements.\n\nRyan Gosling delivers a compelling performance. His role as a stuntman/sometimes-getaway driver may be short on dialogues, but rest assured, he communicates effectively with brooding silences and subtle expressions. Carey Mulligan serves as the perfect foil to his character, embodying vulnerability with a quiet strength that echoes throughout the film.\n\nWhere \"Drive\" really shines though, is in its pacing. The film ebbs and flows with tranquil, near-silent scenes abruptly shattered by sudden, shocking violence. The tense, unpredictable atmosphere is further enhanced by Cliff Martinez's hypnotic synth-driven score that underscores the film’s pulsating tension, adding another layer of grit and menace to the narrative.\n\n\"Drive” is not for the faint at heart, what with its brutally visceral depiction of violence. But beneath all that brutality lies a strangely romantic tale, a stylized neo-noir thriller that plunges you into a world you'd probably never see, accompanied by characters who speak more through silence and stares than words.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Drive\" is a bold, adrenaline-fuelled ride that artfully combines arthouse sensibilities with mainstream appeal. Its potent mix of captivating performances, stunning visuals, and a remarkably atmospheric score make it an unforgettable viewing experience. If you're a fan of films that dare to leave the traditional narrative behind for a more experiential form of storytelling, then definitely give this one a 'Drive'.",

    "\"22 Jump Street\" is a rehash of the \"21 Jump Street\" film with two new leads (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum). Although they are not as funny as their predecessors (Ice Cube and Channing Tatum), they provide a good deal of humor and entertainment. The film takes place right after Tatum and Ice Cube graduate from \"21 Jump Street\", but they are still given assignments on campus.\nUnfortunately, the comedy in these movies never becomes too ridiculous, although it does hit a peak at some times. Nevertheless, the movie is still funny, but the comedy is still mostly based on making fun of things in the plot, much like the first movie. Although the story is predictable, the jokes are still pretty funny and there are some good parodies to watch out for, including a joke about a student who dies while trying to run from campus.\nThe movie has a lot of humor and action, but the humor may be too juvenile. It's easy to tell that the film was meant to be rated PG-13, but it seems like a bit of a waste to rate it PG-13. The film has many jokes that could offend some people if they are sensitive to certain things. However, in most cases, the jokes don't hurt too much, but it's still a good idea to watch the movie with caution. Also, the movie does not have much blood, but it does have a blood gag that is hilarious.\n\"22 Jump Street\" is a great movie for anyone who enjoys a good comedy with some action. If you enjoy the first movie, it's worth a look, and the sequel will definitely be funnier.\n\"22 Jump Street\" is a great movie, and it's definitely worth a second viewing. It's a great movie, but it's not as funny as the first film. It still has a lot of laughs, however. \"22 Jump Street\" is also an example of a funny movie that doesn't go overboard with its jokes. If you like the first movie, you will definitely enjoy this one.\nThursday, 28 May 2020 18:23\nI have seen many movies from the same franchise, and I think this is the most original one. The film tries to play with the conventions of the genre, but I think it succeeds. It's an original plot, it's a very clever story",
    "We present a new algorithm, MUSIC (MUSIC-based estimation), which can be used to estimate the probability that a given music file will be played by a human listener. The algorithm uses a novel approach to estimating the probability of a particular piece of music being played by a human listener. We show how this method can be applied to many different types of data and we demonstrate its performance on several real world datasets. Our results indicate that MUSIC outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and speed.",
    "This academic paper presents a new method for determining the primordial helium (He) abundance using the helium I 10830A emission line. The study is representative of significant advancements in the field of cosmology as accurate assessments of primordial He abundance carry remarkable implications on our understanding of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the formation of the universe, and the rates of star and galaxy formation. The results exhibited a high consistency with standardized measurements, positing this method as a reliable and novel tool for cosmological extrapolation. This paper carries potential implications for enriching our grasp on cosmology and the universe's evolution, supporting existing theoretical predictions and observational constraints.",
    "Hey there, fellow Redditors. \n\nI've been having a bit of a hard time managing both my school obligations and my commitment to my sports team simultaneously. As much as I am elated to be a part of the team, I sincerely worry about my academic performance taking a hit because of the amount of time and energy athletics require. \n\nBetween practice, games, studying, and other social commitments, there simply aren't enough hours in the day. I've tried to utilize as much time as I can cram in for studying, even during bus rides to games. Regardless, I constantly feel overworked and my grades are not as high as I would like them to be.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this predicament? I truly could benefit from some advice on how to manage my time more effectively, or even just some motivation that it's possible to succeed while doing both. I love being part of a team and don't want to quit, but academics are also incredibly important to me. All suggestions are eagerly taken on board. \n\nThanks.",
    "Recurrent Networks (NNs) have been successfully used to understand many other real-world problems like object detection in video images. To date, however, these networks are not able to reliably infer semantic structures across large video datasets. For example, a popular model used by the open-access Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) [9] that is commonly used in image classification and object detection algorithms, was built using a simple, fast convolutional recurrent network. We demonstrate that a more complex version of this network with the right structure can achieve surprisingly good performance for video segmentation, but with more complex requirements on network parameters and on the training setup. We discuss the results of our work in several applications that support human language comprehension or object detection related models that require more sophisticated features, and we give a concrete understanding of what needs to be addressed by further research. We highlight the potential of recurrent networks for video segmentation models and provide recommendations on how to improve performance.\n\nThe paper is here (PDF). I have added some comments that I had about the paper and some of the other related papers in the link below. I think that this is a powerful demonstration of the promise of NNs and the ability to use NNs with much more sophisticated output.\n\n[10] The following is a quote from the abstract: \"Video segmentation refers to the ability to identify salient features of a video (i.e., locations) without requiring knowledge of the scenes present.\"\n\n[11] I think it is helpful to point out that this paper describes a system whose goal has been to analyze a scene from a video frame by frame, not to analyze a stream of bytes. In order to make sure that the input stream is the same, a small difference in pixel positions need not be considered problematic, as this is already performed by the decoder. The NNs used in this paper are relatively simple, but not simple enough, in my opinion. A single convolutional layer must perform a much more complicated job, but we need a few layers of convolutions just to be able to do this job effectively. A real-life example of this kind of problem is that of color discrimination or recognition.\n\n[12] This paper also describes NNs that are able to process and characterize arbitrary images in different ways (e",

    "This paper presents a new semi-supervised segmentation method for electron microscopy images, called Semi-supervised Hierarchical Merge Tree (SSHMT). It is inspired by the fact that the segmentation task is strongly dependent on the quality of the labeled samples. We propose an algorithm that iteratively produces pseudo labels for unlabeled samples so as to increase the quality of the whole segmentation model via active learning. The SSHMT method is based on the hierarchical merge tree (HMT) method. During each iteration, a number of samples are selected according to a distance-based acquisition function. These samples generate pseudo labels and are added into the labeled dataset.\nSSHMT also introduces a new concept of uncertainty which captures the confidence of the model on a given sample. These two components (acquisition function and uncertainty) are further adapted in an attention-based neural network to produce powerful pseudo labels. This novel method has been validated on three different electron microscopy datasets and has also been compared with other well-known segmentation methods. In general, our method has outperformed others on almost every dataset and has demonstrated particularly impressive results for the largest of them.\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"Active Learning on Real-World Data Using a Hierarchical Gaussian Process Model\" from arxiv.org:\nWe propose an algorithm to make active learning as effective as possible on real-world datasets where only a few labeled examples are initially available. In order to do so, we propose a novel method to estimate the uncertainty associated with any sample in any dataset. We use the uncertainty as a criterion in order to select the most suitable sample to be evaluated by an expert. Compared to other methods, our hierarchical Gaussian process model allows to: i) have better uncertainty estimates about individual samples even though only a few labeled examples are available; ii) exploit previous evaluations of the classifier when they are available. Extensive experiments on a large variety of binary real-world classification tasks - ranging from the well known handwritten digit recognition task to a novel task on real face images - show that our method results in an average reduction of 10% of the number of evaluations necessary to reach an arbitrary accuracy threshold, with only a minimal degradation of the classification performance. For example, on the most challenging dataset investigated here, the average number of",

    "\"Gravity\" is a cinematic masterpiece that takes viewers on a thrilling journey through the vast expanse of space. Director Alfonso Cuarón has created a visually stunning and emotionally gripping film that pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved in cinema.\n\nThe film's plot revolves around two astronauts, played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, who are left stranded in space after their shuttle is destroyed. The performances by the lead actors are nothing short of phenomenal. Bullock, in particular, delivers a career-defining performance, portraying a range of emotions that keep you invested in her character's survival.\n\nThe real star of \"Gravity\", however, is its breathtaking visuals. The film's depiction of space is awe-inspiring, with stunning shots of Earth and the endless void of space. The 3D effects are used to great effect, enhancing the feeling of depth and distance, and adding to the overall immersive experience.\n\nThe sound design is equally impressive, with the silence of space punctuated by the characters' breathing and the occasional sound of debris hitting their suits. This creates a sense of isolation and tension that is palpable throughout the film.\n\n\"Gravity\" is not just a film, but an experience. It's a heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that leaves you breathless. It's a testament to the power of cinema and a reminder of our own insignificance in the grand scheme of the universe. Despite its setting in the vastness of space, it's a deeply human story about resilience, survival, and the will to live.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Gravity\" is a must-watch for any film enthusiast. It's a visually stunning, emotionally charged film that will leave you in awe long after the credits roll. It's a film that truly deserves the term 'epic', and one that will undoubtedly stand the test of time.",
    "Lately, I've started realizing that my medication, which I take daily for ADHD, plays a significant role in boosting my 'impostor syndrome'. I know that this sounds strange but let me elaborate.\n\nWhile my medication essentially helps me focus and accomplish tasks more efficiently, it concurrently makes me hyper-aware of my own performance which leads to self-deprecating thoughts, i.e., \"Are my achievements really valid?\", \"Did I only succeed due to the meds?\", \"Would I have been able to do this without medication?\" and so on. I can't help but feel like my success is artificial, a result of the meds and not my ability.\n\nSurprisingly, this feeling worsens after successful events or tasks. Case in point, if I work on a project and it ends up being successful, instead of relishing in the accomplishment, my brain shifts to the narrative that 'the win' was probably because of the medication.\n\nI understand that a large group of professionals across various fields suffer from impostor syndrome, but I feel that my condition intensifies due to my ADHD medication. \n\nI am wholly grateful for the benefits my medication provides me.

    "So I have a somewhat weird question. My wife and I haven't been married very long and sometimes I feel like I'm reading her mind. It started when we were dating and it seems to have increased. My wife is very quiet about things that are bothering her and she is very good about expressing her wants and needs. In fact, she's better than me sometimes. The problem is though, I can tell what's bothering her and when something is bothering her I feel like it's a big deal to me. Like I said, I haven't been married for very long, but I can't be reading my wife's mind the entire time. What should I think about this? I hope it doesn't lead to me being controlling but it's kind of weird. I guess I'm more concerned about keeping her at ease rather than being controlling\nSounds like she needs to open up to you\nIt might feel natural for you to be reading her mind but it's not good for the relationship when you can be sure she'll be comfortable telling you her thoughts. If I feel like my wife would find it normal to express herself verbally rather than in my head, I think that's good. Maybe your wife doesn't think she's a psychic? It's normal for people to have premonitions for each other.\nOne day you might have one and think about whether or not you should tell your wife. It's okay to tell her if you can't handle her worrying about you if you think you have to share the power with him. If you can't afford it, you should just say that you're just imagining the worst. If you do have a premonition about death or a major change or something happening to one of you, it's best to talk about what you're feeling with your wife.\nA wife who feels her husband is doing this is more likely to tell him and try to get him to be able to stop doing this than she would be before the wedding. It's not uncommon for a wife to think she's getting a glimpse into the future and think her husband is doing this but then her husband tells her they're doing it to prevent something negative from happening. In my opinion, this is a good thing for both of you but it's definitely something I'd tell my husband right away if he's not aware of what you're feeling.\nIn my",

Gordon Lightfoot's storytelling is exemplary, but the song is not a monument of musical accomplishment.\n\nThe melody is rather repetitive and doesn't quite capture the sinister nature of the narrative. I'm not denying the song's folk appeal, but apart from being a sorrowful tale, it doesn't offer much in terms of musical dynamics. It's more of a narrated incident with a single, rather monotonous, tune playing in the background.\n\nMoreover, I feel that the cult-like status this song has received within the folk music scene is somewhat undeserved. There are other maritime disaster songs such as \"Mary Ellen Carter\" by Stan Rogers or \"Fire and Water\" by Fotheringay that were more emotionally powerful and musically challenging but have never quite received the same level of recognition.\n\nI believe that the popularity of the song is partly driven by the dramatic lore surrounding the shipwreck rather than its musical merit. Ultimately, I would challenge folk music enthusiasts to delve deeper into the genre to discover underrated gems that surpass \"The Wreck of Edmund Fitzgerald\".",
    "UK house prices experienced a slight dip in November, according to the latest data from the Nationwide Building Society. This marks the first decline in property values since the start of the pandemic, signalling a potential cooling in the housing market.\n\nThe average price of a home in the UK fell by 0.5% to £252,687 in November, down from £253,346 in October. Despite this, house prices remain 10% higher than they were a year ago, reflecting the strong growth seen in the market over the past 12 months.\n\nThe dip in prices comes after a period of sustained growth, fuelled by a combination of low interest rates, the stamp duty holiday, and a desire for more space as more people work from home. However, with the end of the stamp duty holiday in September and the Bank of England hinting at a potential rise in interest rates, the market appears to be adjusting.\n\nRobert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: \"The modest fall in November is the first monthly decline since June 2020. While it is too early to say whether it marks the beginning of a sustained period of price falls, it seems likely that the housing market will slow in the months ahead.\"\n\nThe slowdown in price growth was most pronounced in London, where prices fell by 1.2% in November. However, the capital's house prices are still 4.8% higher than a year ago.\n\nDespite the dip, the housing market remains robust. The number of property transactions in October was around 10% higher than the pre-pandemic average, according to HM Revenue and Customs data.\n\nHowever, some experts warn that the market could face headwinds in the coming months. Rising inflation, potential interest rate hikes, and the end of the furlough scheme could all put pressure on household finances and dampen demand for property.\n\n\"The housing market has been on a rollercoaster ride over the past year and a half, and it's unclear how long this period of price growth can continue,\" said Islay Robinson, CEO of Enness Global Mortgages. \"With the potential for economic uncertainty on the horizon, buyers and sellers should prepare for possible further fluctuations in the market.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty, the long-term outlook for the UK housing market remains positive, with demand for property expected to remain strong due to a chronic shortage of homes.",

    "A \"hero's journey\" is often a journey to seek justice; here, it is to rescue a princess whom the kingdom has abandoned. When his father, King Ailfrost, is stricken with a deadly disease, he calls for a warrior chief. The young man, Balor (Luke Evans), agrees. Though Balor has a warrior's mind and a strong constitution, he is unprepared for the challenges in his new role.\n\nWhile battling his father's enemies, Balor has become embroiled in an underground war—to free the kingdom from a demonic plague before it is too late. The stakes are high, to say the least, for King Ailfrost and his kingdom.\n\nThis will be a hard road to navigate, as the story makes clear. We see this first-hand during the battle for the throne, which leads to the final film, \"The Last King of Scotland.\"\n\nWe know from both film clips and interviews that the lead actor in the film, Luke Evans, is a natural leader. The movie's trailer makes him look like a king, but at times, he is more of a \"lover\" than a king.\n\nHis first battle in \"The Last King of Scotland\" is the film's best scene. The trailer starts with him jumping from one horse to the next, attacking with a variety of weapons, both real and animated. He is in action mode from his very first moment. He has an interesting voice over that could well lead one to believe he might be a comic relief character by this point (perhaps that will work well in the trailer).\n\nThe two best battles he has in the book are on horseback, in which he is constantly outgunned. He also has several battles on foot in the book, but they often seem slower and more methodical as compared to the horse-based battle sequences in the movie.\n\nEvans' most interesting battle is where he uses only two weapons. One is a long wooden blade known as a \"sabre. With this weapon, he is able to take down a large variety of creatures including trolls and giants. Another weapon, commonly known as \"the spear,\" is thrown by him from the side. Here, it is used to pierce and damage the beast's hide.\n\nThis scene, in which Evans doesn't use any weapons other than his sword",
    "This academic paper explores the phenomenon of shock formation of long wavelength femtosecond pulses in dispersive media, such as light transmitting materials. The study relies heavily on complex mathematical and physical models to exploit the nonlinear behavior of pulses. We provide numerical simulations demonstrating this shock formation and its dependence on factors such as the wavelength and dispersion of the media. Our results underline a relatively unexplored area of physics, indicating that the shock dynamics of femtosecond pulses are crucial for shaping and manipulating ultra-fast laser beams. The findings may have significant applications in areas such as communication technology and medicine.",
    "China's state-owned newspaper, the Beijing News, is to buy a stake in China's biggest English-language news website, Sina. As well as publishing the Times of India, China's largest English language paper, the newspaper now plans to buy a controlling stake in Sina's parent company, the privately owned Shenzhen-based Yitao. The Chinese version of the company is the country's number one Internet news website, with annual revenues increasing 10 times to 60m yuan ($10.9m, £6.5m) in 2016. The deal will value Yitao at about $35bn. China's Communist Party newspapers, including the official Xinhua newsagency, are not allowed to write articles on the public sector, but many in the public are using the websites as their source of news.\n\nAt the beginning of the article Yitao's Chairman and CEO Yu Jianguo had the following to say about China:\n\n\"The Chinese government has clearly recognised the importance of an open media ecosystem to China's economic and social development, which is why it introduced media ownership restrictions in 2016.\"\n\nFor those who don't speak Chinese, the Chairman of Yitao would have been Yu Zhongmei. He holds various top leadership positions at Yitao including his Chairman's post. The Yitao's Chairman is listed on the Forbes list of China's rich!\n\nBack in 2013, I wrote about what I had heard about the Chairman of Yitao:\n\n\"Xiao Xiangwei, Chairman of the Shenzhen-based Yitao Group, is chairman of China's most politically ambitious Internet news and search portal, a role that could help Yitao become China's next Big Media—a kind of \"new media\" powerhouse that will dominate the online news and information landscape.\"\n\nThe key thing here is Yitao's Chairman, Yu Jianguo, is on China's Politburo Standing Committee, China's top committee that's not only responsible for overseeing national policy, but also handles key appointments and matters related to Chinese media. Therefore, this is what Yu was being paid to do for China in the years since he sold his stake in Sina back in 2012 to a Hong Kong company for $6 million.\n\nAt that time a well-known news anchor I met at a business conference in Shenzhen told",

    "This film was an instant classic when it came out in 1999, and has since become one that will be remembered as long there are people who love movies around to talk about them! The Wachowski Brothers (Lana & Andy) have created something truly unique with this story; they've taken elements found throughout many different genres such sci-fi/action films like Star Wars or Terminator 2 but also added their own twist by making Neo's journey into another world seem more realistic than most other similar stories would allow him too - which makes sense considering how much time he spends inside his computer programing code lines instead just fighting off bad guys all day every single second without any breaks whatsoever until finally reaching some sorta climax where everything seems resolved once again only temporarily though because now comes part two...which brings us back right here at square zero ready start over yet?

    "This film is about a young woman who has been raped and murdered by her boyfriend, but she doesn't want to believe it was him. She wants to know why he did it. Her mother (played by Jennifer Garner) believes that if she tells anyone what happened, they will kill her. The only person who can help her find out the truth is her best friend, a man named John (played by Michael Fassbender). He's an ex-con with a violent past. When he comes into town, he takes her on a tour of his old neighborhood where he shows her some of the things he used to do when he was younger. They go back to his house and he reveals that he killed his girlfriend in cold blood. He says that he didn't mean to hurt her, but he couldn't control himself. He had no choice because he loved her so much. He then goes on to say that he knows how she feels and that he loves her too. He asks her to come home with him. She refuses and he leaves. She calls her mom and tells her everything that happened. She also tells her that she thinks that maybe she should tell someone. Her mom agrees and tells her that she needs to talk to someone. She goes to see her therapist, Dr. Kline (played by James Franco), who tells her that she needs to get over this horrible experience. She does and she starts to feel better. However, she still hasn't told anyone else about what happened. She decides to call her best friend, John, who lives across town. He picks up the phone and she tells him what happened. He immediately gets angry at her and tells her that she shouldn't have done that. He tells her that he'll never forgive her and that he won't be able to live without her.

    "This paper investigates the structural and dynamic changes in the functional networks of brain lobes at the onset of anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness. Using advanced neuroimaging techniques, we analyzed the alterations in connectivity patterns and network properties across different brain regions. Our findings suggest significant changes in the functional organization of the brain, with a marked decrease in network integration and an increase in network segregation. These changes were observed across all lobes, but were most pronounced in the frontal and parietal lobes. The results provide valuable insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness and could potentially guide the development of more effective and safer anesthetic drugs.",
    "Operational concurrency control is concerned with the implementation of concurrency control algorithms.\nUntil now, operational concurrency control solutions have been focused on providing a consistent view of a database\neven in the presence of high read and write latencies, rather than in the optimization of read and write latencies\nthemselves. Consequently, previous distributed systems research does not discuss the possibility of optimizing the\nperformance of operations themselves to increase concurrency without sacrificing database consistency.\n\nThis paper attempts to address this concern by considering a model of consistent concurrency control at the\noperation level. In particular, the paper proposes a set of distributed operation classes that define an equivalence\nclass for operations and describes the properties of these classes. It is shown that this model can be\nutilized to provide optimal performance for all operations in the presence of arbitrary read and write latencies.\n\nA consistent concurrency control algorithm is then derived that exploits this model. This algorithm is\nimplemented and benchmarked and compared with a number of existing algorithms in the presence of high\nread and write latencies. It is shown that this algorithm outperforms all of its competitors, often\nproviding improvements of up to a factor of 10, while maintaining the desired consistency semantics of the\ndatabase.\n\nThe full text of this research paper can be found at: [Operational Concurrency Control in the Face of Arbitrary Scale and Latency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01161.pdf)\n\n# Requirements\n\n* Python >= 3.4\n* pip\n\n# Installation\n\nClone or download the repository, then...\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n# Getting Started\n\nTo run the benchmarks...\n\n```bash\npython -m benchmark\n```\n\n...will launch a benchmark of all algorithms in the paper.

    "I'm worried that the Helrik storyline will be too much for some people to handle, and I don't want to see it spoiled by spoilers. So here's my thoughts on what I think happened with Helrik.\n\nFirst off, I have no idea how many episodes there are left in season 4. The last episode was just released yesterday (May 31st). If you're wondering why I say this, it's because I've been watching the show since its first season, and I know that they only air one episode at a time. They usually do a re-airing of an old episode after a few weeks or months, but I haven't seen any of those yet.\n\nSo if you're wondering where I got my information, I can tell you that I watched the entire series through Netflix. I also watched the first two seasons back to back, so I had plenty of time to watch all of them.\n\nNow, let me explain what I mean when I say that I'm not sure how many episodes there are left. When I started watching the show, I thought that there were 12 episodes per season. But then I realized that there were actually 13 episodes per season. And now I realize that there are 14 episodes per season. That means that there are probably more than 20 episodes left in the current season.\n\nBut I still don't know how many episodes there are. Because I didn't start watching until the second season, I never saw the first three episodes of the fourth season. So I don't really know how many episodes there are.\n\nAnd I'm not even going to bother trying to guess how many episodes there are. It's impossible. There's no way to figure out how many episodes there are without knowing exactly how many episodes there are.\n\nWhat I am saying is that I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are.

    "I've been thinking about this for a while now and I wanted to see what the Reddit community thinks about it. \n\nIn my opinion, requiring employees to get a doctor's note for being out sick seems a bit counterproductive. Firstly, if someone is genuinely ill, the last thing they would want to do is to leave their bed and go to a clinic or hospital, potentially spreading their germs to others. Secondly, it puts an unnecessary burden on our healthcare system. Doctors and other medical professionals are already overworked and dealing with more serious cases. Do they really need to be writing notes for people who have a common cold or a stomach bug?\n\nMoreover, this practice seems to be based on a lack of trust towards employees. If someone says they're sick, why can't we just believe them? Of course, there will always be people who might take advantage of this, but I believe most people are honest and wouldn't lie about being sick. \n\nLastly, not everyone has the privilege of easy access to healthcare. For some, getting a doctor's note means paying out of pocket for a visit, which can be a financial burden. \n\nI understand that employers need to ensure that employees are not taking unnecessary leaves, but isn't there a better way to handle this? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.",
    "Adaptation\nAdaptation refers to the process of inheriting new features. It's genetic. Phenotypic plasticity is mostly about non-genetic changes.\nPhenotypic plasticity\n\nPhenotypic plasticity is when you have different phenotypes (appearance/physiology) within a species which vary according to the environment. For example, the tail length of the same lizard will vary depending on the average size of the male and female lizards who mated together.\n\nSo if it's non-genetic, how do these changes persist from generation to generation?\nA common form of this is a \"response to environmental challenge\". The environment alters the physiology of an organism, which increases the chances of that organism surviving, therefore increasing it's chances to produce offspring. For example, if you raise a plant in cold, dark conditions it will produce bigger buds because it needs to make up for the lack of light. If the plant was grown in normal conditions it would produce smaller buds. If the cold conditions persist, the plant will likely stay in \"cold, dark\" mode and produce bigger-than-normal buds. The same would happen with plants grown under \"hot, light\" conditions.\nPlants can also respond to environmental challenge by altering their environment. A well known example is the Venus flytrap. The flytrap develops a large trap that is highly receptive to flies.\nA very important point is that the \"newly-inherited\" traits of a phenotype can come from either the parents or the environment. A very good example of this is when the parents mate within the same environment.\n\nWhat is the difference between adaptation and plasticity?\nAdaptation refers to inheritable change over generations. This can either be gradual (for example, fish become more and more at home in the waters they live in) or instant (for example, a fish jumps up waterfall and is unable to ever go back). If a fish evolves so that it can only breathe water (aquaponics) it would not be able to live outside water, even if it had a chance to return to water. It would die.\n\nPlasticity is non-inheritable change during the lifetime of the individual. A tree bent by a strong gust of wind will not grow up straight ever again. A fish that lives underwater until it grows old will never",

    "\"Van Helsing\" is a hoot. After reading so much praise of the film, I went in with a huge dose of skepticism but boy was I wrong! This is a fast-paced, action-packed, dark parody with loads of clever moments. Van Helsing is about the same as any other action parody- a classic good versus evil battle of wit and fisticuffs. However, I would like to add that there is more: Much of the jokes in the film are actually cleverly written, the soundtrack works amazingly well in almost every scene, the acting is superb and there is plenty of blood, gore and fun.\nThe film's story (it won't spoil it for you, even if you try to avoid knowing about it beforehand!) is a continuation of the old classic legend about vampire Van Helsing. Our Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a badass fighter with a sense of humor. It is a very fun character to see on the screen and Jackman does a top-notch job portraying him. Van Helsing uses his trusty flintlock silver crossbow (look carefully and you will see it appears in every scene with him!) to take down bloodsuckers, but not without losing a few limbs along the way. He is quite the witty man, too, and often says silly things during intense situations!\nVan Helsing is joined in his battle against the vampires with the help of his friend (played by Richard Roxburgh). But the main evil and quite sexy Dracula (a great job by Gabriel Byrne in a dark and villainous role) is out to kill all human beings on Earth. He has an army of other vampires to help him do just that. However, Van Helsing knows what he is up against (I'm sure he has fought such an evil before) so he's always prepared.\nOne of the many entertaining parts of the film is when Van Helsing finds the key to killing Dracula. The key, a heart of another vampire, only works for about 60 seconds a day when the sun shines over Dracula. He and Van Helsing have numerous encounters with each other and each time the movie goes from hilarious to intense in an instant. The action is always happening around the two, and most of the movie goes on as if the world",
    "Hello everyone,\n\nI wanted to open up a discussion about something that's been on my mind for a while now. I am a bisexual individual who also happens to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I've found that these two aspects of my identity can sometimes complicate my romantic relationships in ways that are difficult for others to understand.\n\nBeing bisexual, I am attracted to both men and women. This can sometimes lead to confusion or misunderstanding from partners who are not familiar with bisexuality. They may question my commitment or fidelity, simply because I have the capacity to be attracted to more than one gender. It's a common misconception that bisexuality equates to promiscuity, which is not the case at all. I am just as capable of monogamy as anyone else.\n\nOn the other hand, being bipolar brings its own set of challenges. The mood swings associated with my disorder can be difficult for partners to understand or cope with. I can go from being extremely happy and energetic to feeling low and lethargic in a short span of time. This can be confusing and frustrating for someone who doesn't understand the nature of bipolar disorder.\n\nThese two aspects of my identity intersect in ways that can make romantic relationships challenging. I often feel like I have to educate my partners about both bisexuality and bipolar disorder, which can be exhausting. It's also difficult to find someone who is understanding and accepting of both these aspects of my identity.\n\nI'm curious to hear from others who may be in a similar situation. How do you navigate romantic relationships while being bisexual and bipolar? What challenges have you faced and how have you overcome them? Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks for reading.",

    "Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has ruled out using his third centre-back this season, ruling out John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic due to injury concerns.\n\n\nTerry (ankle) is not available for Saturday's game against West Ham when he recovers from ankle ligament surgery – but former France defender Ivanovic remains on course to be fit after undergoing treatment on Tuesday night at Chelsea's training ground. As well as Terry, the pair were also both selected by Arsenal manager Alex Ferguson in Sunday's victory over Stoke City.\n\n\nBut Wenger said: 'He's fine now but I'm sorry to say there are some players who aren't ready yet. That's something we don't allow.' The Gunners will also have Jack Wilshere available again after missing three games with calf/bicep injuries\n\nIt will put even more pressure on Petr Cech as Chelsea look likely to return him to first team action for England's World Cup adventure. And while we all hope that will provide an instant solution to Cech being without his goalkeeper, it should be noted that Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho recently indicated that John Ruddy might be given the nod to start on Saturday, which would potentially mean another Arsenal goalkeeping dilemma coming into play.",

    "> We present a novel interactive segmentation method for patterned images. The method is based on a content-based propagation of user markings. The user is asked to mark a few pixels in the image, and the method automatically propagates the markings to the rest of the image. The propagation is based on a content-based similarity measure between the marked pixels and the rest of the image. The method is interactive in the sense that the user can correct the propagation by marking additional pixels. The method is also robust to noise and to the presence of multiple patterns in the image. We demonstrate the method on several images with different patterns.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe problem is to segment an image into regions that are similar to each other. The image is a two-dimensional array of pixels, and each pixel has a color. The goal is to divide the image into regions such that the pixels in each region have similar colors.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe solution is to use a content-based propagation of user markings. The user is asked to mark a few pixels in the image, and the method automatically propagates the markings to the rest of the image.

    "Somewhere in the world, there's a kid who didn't get the memo. A kid who's never really heard \"Come Together\" or \"Octopus' Garden.\" Maybe it's at a country and western hoedown, or a disco-dancing contest (where he's got that \"I'm A Loser\" beat so perfect) or an Elvis impersonator contest. Or maybe he's a little beatnik who's in a jazz club--but he's the only kid in the place. No matter where he's playing, he's so good and so young that by far, he's the coolest thing in the club. He's the one with the best chops. He's the best of the best. He's playing the best. The best. He's rockin' the most. He's playin' the hottest. The hottest. His drumming is kickin'. He's a drummer's drummer and he can play all night, all night. And, he still needs a good pair of shoes.\nWe're introduced to him as a baby, in a cradle, looking all angelic as he floats in a black void.

This innovative neural network model addresses inherent challenges in maintaining consistency in attributes and structures of images during the translation process. Our results demonstrate that Sem-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in quantitative evaluations, offering higher translation accuracy while maintaining semantic consistency. Furthermore, the proposed method produces visually impressive results on various translation tasks, including object transfiguration, season transfer, and photo-to-cartoon translation. The paper provides insights into the model's design, training, and evaluation criteria, contributing to further advancements in image-to-image translation research.",

For each object detection, we develop a histogram of intensity/depth values with subranges that are correlated with known collision avoidance behaviors (steering, acceleration) as well as potential user intent such as steering left for 'backing up' by crossing right lane, or braking after running off the road into kerbs/footpaths/leaving stop light etc.. Our method aims at finding high dimensional subsets of objects corresponding to perceived motion directions (horizontal motion detected directly by sensor while rotation detected by camera, where appropriate).",

It was entertaining enough that we had plenty of time to think, so I am sure I can give more attention to other things and let it go. This film has been released over 2 decades after the war ended. I would highly recommend watching it as early as possible though not any later until you know what you're getting into with these special effects...this movie is NOT a fairytale, nor it's intended by Hollywood to be, but a realistic picture of the life inside the American Union army, with all it's flaws and misfortunes..... The thing about this film, well almost this was very true even back on September 11th 2002....it tells what happened with an accuracy that I had only dreamed about and could never have understood before, which is why there is no way to ever forget this story......I suppose that the first lesson for us Americans must always remain this one.................we are the strongest nation that the world has seen. We have everything we need for survival...................and yet at the same time our politicians and governments make it hard.......We should never lose hope, unless it comes from losing ourselves.\n\nRead More",
    "This academic paper presents an innovative approach called Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation (GMSD) as a perceptual image quality index. GMSD overcomes the computation complexity of existing methods while maintaining impressive accuracy and consistency when predicting human visual perception. By focusing on the gradient magnitude similarity between the reference and distorted image, GMSD accurately measures image quality. Experiments reveal that GMSD demonstrates superior performance in efficiency and prediction accuracy when compared against current image quality assessment models on four public databases. Thus, GMSD is a promising method for real-time image quality assessment applications, offering both high-level prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.",
    "Chilean victims of the Pinochet regime are set to receive considerable compensation after a US court ruled in their favour this week. The court instructed the Riggs Bank to compensate the victims. The bank was found guilty of concealing and laundering millions of dollars for the repressive regime led by Augusto Pinochet.\n\nPinochet, who led a military coup in Chile in 1973 and ruled until 1990, is believed to have hidden up to $1bn abroad. The money was allegedly laundered through several banks, primarily the now-closed Riggs Bank.\n\nThe victims who initiated the lawsuit against Riggs Bank include people who were tortured, bereaved or displaced during Pinochet's rule. The payout is being lauded as a significant victory for human rights activists who have bemoaned the lack of accountability for the extensive human rights abuses that transpired under Pinochet's rule.\n\nPinochet is accused of numerous human rights violations during his 17-year rule in Chile, including the disappearance and murder of thousands of opponents. The Riggs Bank, based in the US, was accused of aiding and abetting these abuses by helping him hide his wealth, making them complicit in his crimes.\n\nDetails of the financial settlement have not been publicly disclosed. However, the payout is expected to be considerable, a much-needed compensation for the extreme suffering inflicted upon the victims of Pinochet's regime.\n\nRiggs Bank has previously paid $16m to the US Justice Department over irregularities in its handling of Pinochet's accounts. This new payout will be dedicated specifically to the victims and their families.\n\nThe ruling by the US courts is significant and sets a precedent. It is the first legal conviction that holds a financial institution accountable for its involvement with the Pinochet regime.\n\nWhile this ruling is an important step towards justice for the victims, it also highlights the need for international vigilance to ensure banks and other institutions cannot be exploited by corrupt regimes for their personal advantage.\n\nHuman rights campaigners are hoping that this ruling will deter banks from becoming complicit in such crimes in the future. This could be a significant milestone in the pursuit of international justice and a way to acknowledge and compensate those who suffered under Pinochet's brutal rule.",

    "In a significant development, no charges will be filed against the renowned television personality, Bill Cosby, according to the latest reports. The decision comes after a thorough investigation into multiple allegations of sexual assault against the actor.\n\nCosby, 83, best known for his role in the popular 1980s sitcom \"The Cosby Show\", has been at the centre of a media storm since 2014 when numerous women came forward accusing him of sexual misconduct. The allegations spanned several decades, with some dating back to the late 1960s.\n\nThe decision not to press charges was announced by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. They stated that in most cases, the statute of limitations had expired. In the remaining cases, there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime had been committed.\n\nThe District Attorney's office also noted that the decision not to charge Cosby should not be seen as a validation of his innocence or guilt. The decision was based purely on legal considerations and the available evidence.\n\nCosby's legal team has consistently denied all allegations, describing them as \"decades-old, discredited\" claims. They have argued that the accusations were part of a campaign to tarnish the reputation of the actor, who was once a beloved figure in American television.\n\nThe decision not to charge Cosby has been met with mixed reactions. While some see it as a failure of the justice system to hold powerful figures accountable, others view it as a vindication of the actor's claims of innocence.\n\nDespite the decision, Cosby's legal troubles are far from over. He is currently serving a prison sentence in Pennsylvania after being convicted in 2018 of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home in 2004. Cosby has appealed the conviction, and the case is currently under review by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n\nThe allegations against Cosby have had a significant impact on his career and legacy. Once known as \"America's Dad\", his reputation has been severely damaged, with reruns of \"The Cosby Show\" being pulled from syndication and honorary degrees being rescinded.\n\nThe case has also played a significant role in sparking the #MeToo movement, which has seen a wave of women coming forward to share their experiences of sexual harassment and assault, particularly in the entertainment industry.",

    "The golden rule of public finance remains intact, according to former Treasury aide, Sir Alan Budd. He defended the principle, which states that the government should only borrow to invest over the economic cycle, not to fund current spending.\n\nSir Alan, who was a senior adviser to the Treasury when the rule was introduced, said it was still a \"very good discipline\" for the government. His comments come amid growing criticism of the rule, with some economists arguing that it has been broken due to the current economic climate.\n\nThe golden rule was introduced by former Chancellor Gordon Brown in 1997. It was designed to ensure fiscal responsibility and prevent the government from borrowing excessively to fund day-to-day spending. However, the rule has been under scrutiny recently, with critics suggesting that it has been breached due to the high levels of public borrowing.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Sir Alan maintains that the rule is still relevant and effective. \"The golden rule is a very good discipline. It's a rule that says you can borrow to invest but not to finance current spending,\" he said.\n\nHe also dismissed claims that the rule has been broken, arguing that the current levels of borrowing are due to the economic downturn, not a disregard for the rule. \"The fact that we are borrowing heavily at the moment is because we are in an economic downturn. It's not because we have abandoned the golden rule,\" he added.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with Sir Alan's assessment. Some economists argue that the rule has been stretched to its limits, with the government borrowing to fund current spending, not just investment. They suggest that the rule needs to be revised or replaced to reflect the current economic reality.\n\nDespite these differing views, the debate around the golden rule highlights the ongoing challenges of managing public finances in a volatile economic climate. Whether the rule remains intact or is revised, it is clear that fiscal responsibility will continue to be a key focus for the government.",
    "Abstract The time-reversal of light (TTl) has been observed in many experiments, but its origin remains unknown. Here we report on the experimental realization of TTl using a linear dispersive filter (LDF). We observe that the time-reversed light emitted by an LDF can be reversed by applying a second LDF to the first one. This phenomenon was demonstrated experimentally at room temperature and with a wavelength of 1.5 nm. Our results indicate that the time-reversed light emitted by an LDF can be reversed by applying a second LDF to the first one.",

    "Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has purchased multiple copies of the new Band Aid charity single, in a show of support for the cause. The single, a re-recording of the 1984 hit \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", aims to raise funds for the fight against Ebola in West Africa.\n\nMr Blair, who has been actively involved in various charitable causes since leaving office, bought 10 copies of the single, according to his spokesperson. The spokesperson added that Mr Blair \"strongly supports the cause and encourages everyone to do their bit to help.\"\n\nThe new version of the song, which features a host of stars including One Direction, Ed Sheeran, and Ellie Goulding, was launched by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the original creators of Band Aid. The song has been re-recorded three times since its original release, each time to raise money for different charitable causes.\n\nThe proceeds from the latest version will go towards combating the Ebola crisis in West Africa, which has claimed more than 5,000 lives so far. The single is available for download, and a physical version will be released in December.\n\nMr Blair's purchase follows a similar move by Chancellor George Osborne, who waived VAT on the single, meaning even more money will go to the charity.\n\nBob Geldof praised the support from Mr Blair and Mr Osborne, saying, \"It's great to see politicians putting aside differences and getting behind a good cause.\"\n\nThe original Band Aid single raised £8m for famine relief in Ethiopia. It is hoped that the new version will raise even more to help fight the Ebola crisis.",

    "\"Snowden\" is a compelling and thought-provoking biographical political thriller that delves into the life of Edward Snowden, the infamous NSA whistleblower. Directed by Oliver Stone, the film is a riveting exploration of the modern world's surveillance state and the moral dilemmas that come with it.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a stellar performance as Edward Snowden, capturing the essence of the man with a nuanced portrayal that is both sympathetic and challenging. His transformation from a patriotic soldier to a disillusioned whistleblower is portrayed with a depth and subtlety that keeps the audience engaged throughout.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Shailene Woodley, Zachary Quinto, and Melissa Leo, also deliver strong performances, adding layers to the narrative and enhancing the overall viewing experience. The on-screen chemistry between Gordon-Levitt and Woodley, who plays Snowden's girlfriend Lindsay Mills, is particularly noteworthy, adding a personal dimension to the political drama.\n\nThe film's pacing is well-executed, gradually building tension as Snowden's disillusionment grows and the stakes get higher. Stone's direction is commendable, balancing the technical aspects of the story with the human drama. The screenplay, co-written by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald, is intelligent and insightful, providing a balanced perspective on a controversial subject.\n\nThe cinematography and editing are top-notch, effectively conveying the paranoia and fear that come with living in a surveillance state. The film's score, composed by Craig Armstrong, complements the narrative perfectly, enhancing the suspense and emotional impact of key scenes.\n\n\"Snowden\" is not just a biopic, but a commentary on privacy, freedom, and the price one pays for truth. It's a film that will make you question, reflect, and perhaps even fear. It's a must-watch for anyone interested in contemporary politics, civil liberties, or simply a well-crafted cinematic experience.",

    "This article was written by Rene Echeverria\n\nAnd it was reviewed as follows:\n\nIt's the summer after high school graduation, and Ben Garant, who has just moved to New York City with his girlfriend Claire for good, seems determined not only to live in their apartment but also to get a degree in film criticism. He tries attending various film schools to prove he can speak his mind, while at home, he sees a screening of George Miller's action blockbuster, Mad Max: Fury Road (Mad Max being an inspiration for the villain in this upcoming installment). In front of him, and on a small screen, are Max Rockatansky, played by Tom Hardy; Immortan Joe- The leader known as Immortan Joe who gives Max his backstory as well as his title; Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron; Koba the gorilla- A talking animal with two guns named after him called Kiowa and Wotan; and Max himself...Max himself will become a main protagonist in Tom Hardy's second feature film as a mad-man's journey begins.\n\n\nMAD MAX: FURY ROAD was created a year prior to Fury Road by George Miller (The Dark Knight) and brought to life by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron based on characters from the novel\n\nand short story published by Mel Gibson. It received critical acclaim both critically, and commercially, and grossing over $800 million worldwide (as of 2017 - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1899340/?ref_=nl_bak_3 [IMDB] or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wJ9QCXj4x0 [Netflix]). However, according to IMDb, its status changed when it wasn't picked up for distribution - which may be the reason why it hasn't been made into a TV series.\n\n\nFrom the beginning, Fury Road features a complex narrative structured around three acts, each taking place between 1977's first film and 2015's sixth sequel, making use of flashbacks depicting the history of humanity before Max travels backwards through time across four decades. I won't go too much into details on them. This essay will explore my view about Fury Road's structure and themes within its themes that represent human culture, survival during the apocalypse, conflict driven and a society struggling under",
    "\"Spectre\" undoubtedly cements itself as a high-octane addition to the iconic James Bond franchise. As a die-hard Bond fan, this specific film impressed me with its meticulous homage to classic Bond elements, stylish visuals, and magnetic performances, while introducing compelling narrative twists to the mix. \n\nThe film's producers took every measure to ensure \"Spectre\" matched its predecessors' spectacle and grandeur. Thomas Newman's rousing score punctuates every scene impeccably, giving it an epic quality that is impossible to overlook. Meanwhile, Hoyte van Hoytema's outstanding cinematography is a visual treat, enamoring viewers with sweeping landscapes one moment and switching to ridiculously cool, high-impact action sequences the next. \n\nAs for the performances, Daniel Craig exudes charisma and grit as James Bond. He effectively displays Bond's sophisticated charm, quip-ready humor, and ruthless efficiency, continuing to evolve the iconic character in fascinating ways. Meanwhile, Christoph Waltz delivers a magnetic performance as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, adding depth to the villain’s persona with his nuanced acting.\n\nThe beautiful Lea Seydoux brings vibrancy and tenacity to her role, making a delightful addition to the list of Bond girls. Her chemistry with Craig is palpable and serves as a refreshing departure from some of the past superficial Bond girl portrayals.\n\nThe script also deserves a nod for its intriguing blend of old-school Bond elements with modern narrative sensibilities. \"Spectre\" boldly peels back layers of the character’s past, providing fresh context to his character arc, while also exploring the classic trope of a power-crazed villain with a personal connection to Bond.\n\nWhat slightly holds the film back, however, is a somewhat convoluted plot that occasionally indulges in unnecessary complications. Moreover, while Waltz’s Blofeld is fascinating, he is underutilized, making his character feel slightly shallow compared to past Bond villains.\n\nNevertheless, \"Spectre\" delivers what one expects from a Bond film - cool gadgets, incredible action sequences, exotic locations, stylish suits, and the incredible, irreplaceable charm of 007 himself. It might not redefine the franchise, but it definitely offers a thrilling addition to the Bond saga that caters to both modern audiences and hardcore Bond fans alike.",
    "> We present SynNet, a novel fully convolutional network for medical image synthesis. SynNet is designed to preserve the structure of the input image, which is a key requirement for medical image synthesis. To this end, we propose a novel loss function that combines the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) with the mean squared error (MSE) loss. The proposed loss function is differentiable and can be used in conjunction with the standard MSE loss. We also propose a novel architecture for SynNet that is based on the U-Net architecture. The proposed architecture is designed to preserve the structure of the input image while also being able to generate high-quality synthetic images. We evaluate the performance of SynNet on two medical image synthesis tasks: brain tumor segmentation and liver segmentation. The results show that SynNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both tasks.\n\n## 2. Introduction\n\nMedical image synthesis is an important task in medical image analysis. It is used to generate synthetic images that can be used for training and testing machine learning algorithms. Medical image synthesis can also be used to generate synthetic images that can be used for visualization and diagnosis.\n\nMedical image synthesis is a challenging task due to the complexity of medical images and the need to preserve the structure of the input image. Medical images are often complex and contain a lot of information, such as anatomical structures, textures, and colors. It is important to preserve this information when generating synthetic images.\n\nThere are two main approaches to medical image synthesis: generative adversarial networks (GANs) and fully convolutional networks (FCNs). GANs have been shown to be effective at generating realistic images, but they often struggle to preserve the structure of the input image. FCNs, on the other hand, are designed to preserve the structure of the input image, but they often struggle to generate realistic images.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional network for medical image synthesis. Our network is designed to preserve the structure of the input image while also being able to generate high-quality synthetic images. We evaluate the performance of our network on two medical image synthesis tasks: brain tumor segmentation and liver segmentation. The results show that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both tasks.\n\n## 3.",

    "Chinese authorities have detained several executives from two of the country's largest dairy companies, following allegations of contaminated milk products. The move comes as part of a wider crackdown on food safety violations in the country.\n\nThe executives, from Mengniu Dairy and Yili Industrial Group, are being held on suspicion of producing and selling substandard products. Both companies are among China's largest dairy producers and have previously been implicated in food safety scandals.\n\nThe police have not released the names of the detained individuals, but confirmed that they include senior managers and quality control officers. They are currently being held in custody while investigations continue.\n\nThe detentions follow a series of inspections by China's food safety regulator, which found that some milk products from both companies contained excessive levels of aflatoxin, a potentially harmful substance produced by mould.\n\nIn a statement, the regulator said: \"The companies involved have been ordered to recall all affected products and to take immediate steps to rectify the problem. We will not tolerate any violations of food safety laws.\"\n\nBoth Mengniu and Yili have issued apologies and pledged to cooperate with the authorities. They also promised to strengthen their quality control procedures to prevent any future incidents.\n\nThis is not the first time that China's dairy industry has been hit by scandal. In 2008, six children died and around 300,000 fell ill after consuming milk contaminated with melamine, a toxic industrial compound. The incident led to widespread public outrage and calls for stricter food safety regulations.\n\nThe latest detentions are seen as a sign of the Chinese government's determination to tackle food safety issues, which have become a major public concern in recent years. However, critics argue that more needs to be done to ensure the safety of food products in the country.\n\nThe Chinese government has vowed to crack down on food safety violations and has introduced a series of measures to improve standards. These include stricter penalties for companies found guilty of violations and increased funding for food safety inspections.",

The MRM is a powerful tool that allows for the calculation of transport coefficients in a wide range of systems, including those with complex disorder. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the method, its applications, and its limitations. It also presents a series of numerical simulations to validate the theory and demonstrate its effectiveness. The results show that the MRM can accurately predict transport behavior in systems with both topological and thermal disorder, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field of condensed matter physics.",

    "In this work, we propose an active contour model that uses machine learning to predict its evolution in order not only improve segmentation accuracy but also reduce computational cost by avoiding unnecessary computations at regions where no change occurs during iterations (i.e., stable region). The proposed method consists mainly two steps; first step involves training deep neural networks using variational-level set formulation as input data while second one employs these trained models along with their corresponding loss functions which are used when updating contours iteratively until convergence criteria mets [sic]. This approach allows us both speed up computation time significantly without sacrificing quality results compared traditional methods such Gaussian mixture modeling or mean shift clustering algorithms because they require more memory space due high number parameters involved within each iteration process itself making them less efficient overall performance wise.\"",
    "\"…we are not told how she actually died—only that she was dead by age 18, and her body may have been buried in Texas.\" This seems to be somewhat inconsistent with many other elements in this story—most notably, it is stated that \"Her death caused one last sensation in the mind's eye: her ghostly appearance on the living room couch,\" and again when the girl's father talks to his daughters about their mother, noting how the ghosts had moved into the house. Also, why does it seem like only people who were living at the time see a woman's face? At first I assumed they saw the ghost because everyone felt something in the air when they all started talking about a woman named Marie. Did she just look too human-like to actually go around to many different parts of town during nighttime hours to look for clues to what went wrong in her life? But later I learned that there had reportedly been a previous murder committed at Marie's home at the same address; so why wouldn't any or most of those people still remember seeing Marie in the flesh? And why couldn't some of those same people feel more strongly about looking out their back door than they did at their houses after hearing the news that someone had been killed near them—a story much more gruesome than the crime itself?\" (p. 3)\n\nThat's some pretty solid background in terms of information, but it doesn't really connect up, especially since there is no real explanation as to why a person would want to bury an entire body in Texas (especially considering nobody apparently knew where it had been sent). And in case you thought there were going to be any new information when I got to this paragraph…yes. No one has answered my original question. You're either going to assume that every single member of an already very small circle of investigators had heard of Marie Laveau before starting work, or else have doubts if they didn't believe \"mysterious circumstances\" could cause enough pain to keep them from working on this case.",
    "Nest-box Nintendo DS hardware to be on sale in Europe this week\n\nA year after coming under fire for not having an in-house version, the firm will finally get around to creating one. A UK firm has developed yet another device known as the 'PocketNintendo'. This small box holds a single Nintendo DS and can connect with two devices via wi-fi. It was created by the people behind 'The Noun Project' which creates 3D software that allows users to describe words literally in the world of games.... A Japanese company hopes to create a product similar to the PocketNintendo, but aimed at the US market. It's called the 'Kirin DS', and as you'll see from the above picture it looks a little like something you would find inside a cell phone or on Kickstarter.\n\n\nPosted on March 17th, 2011 | Last updated on March 17th, 2011",
    "Sigh... I just need to vent this out and hope you all could sympathize or perhaps provide some advice.\n\nFor context, I'm a 24-year-old software engineer. I was making some pretty decent money for someone my age and had been with this promising startup for three years. I loved what I was doing, I was extremely skilled in the codes I wrote, and I respected my colleagues. In every sense, it was the perfect job, and I could see myself working there for years.\n\nThat was until yesterday.\n\nWe were planning to launch a new product, something we've been working on for a year. It was expected to sky-rocket the company into new heights and bring in a ton of revenue. But as the head of the development team, I had a lot of pressure on my shoulders.\n\nWorryingly, as we were nearing the launch date - just a few days away - I found what appeared to be a minor bug. I thought it would be a quick fix, but panic set in as I realized how deep-rooted this bug was. This single issue could basically break the product we were releasing, making it essentially useless. \n\nI worked tirelessly - hours on end, I could barely see from exhaustion, much less think clearly. After three entire sleepless nights, I fixed the bug... or so I thought. Because in the process, I’d made an even bigger mistake.\n\nIn my state of utter exhaustion, tinged with relief that I'd squashed the bug, I hurriedly pushed the new code to production without thoroughly testing it. \n\nWhen I woke up (or rather, rose from my desk where I'd fallen asleep), I found hundreds of emails and missed calls on my phone. \n\nIt turns out, the \"fix\" I implemented was worse than the initial bug. It crashed our entire system and wiped out months of work. Not only had we missed the launch, but we also had lost so much critical data that it could potentially sink the company.\n\nI've never felt so low in my entire life. \n\nI screwed up extremely bad, to the point of potentially ruining a multi-million-dollar company and upsetting countless people who counted on me. How do you even begin to bounce back from something like that? \n\nI guess I'm posting this as a cautionary tale to others. No matter how confident or skilled you are, always double-check your work, especially if a lot is riding on it. Always insist on thorough testing, no matter the pressure or deadlines. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading",

    "I've been thinking about this hypothetical scenario for a while now and wanted to get your thoughts on it. What if Steve Nash and Jason Kidd had swapped careers? \n\nImagine if Steve Nash, the two-time MVP, had been drafted by the Dallas Mavericks in 1994 and then traded to the Phoenix Suns in 2001. Would he have been able to lead the Mavericks to the NBA Finals in 2006 and 2011, just like Kidd did? Would he have been able to bring out the best in Dirk Nowitzki and form a dynamic duo with him?\n\nOn the other hand, what if Jason Kidd, the 10-time All-Star, had been drafted by the Phoenix Suns in 1996 and then traded to the Dallas Mavericks in 2004. Would he have been able to revolutionize the Suns' offense and lead them to the Western Conference Finals in 2005 and 2006, just like Nash did? Would he have been able to form a formidable partnership with Amar'e Stoudemire?\n\nBoth Nash and Kidd are undoubtedly two of the greatest point guards in NBA history, but they had very different styles of play. Nash was more of a scoring point guard who was also an excellent passer, while Kidd was more of a traditional point guard who excelled in setting up his teammates and playing defense.\n\nSo, how do you think their careers would have turned out if they had swapped places? Would they have been able to achieve the same level of success, or would their teams have fared differently? I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this.",

    "Ever since I started playing 'Universe: A galactic conquest', I have had this thought brewing in my mind, so I thought to come here and share it with my fellow gamers. \n\nThis idea is about a new superweapon - a 'Planet Annihilator'. I know, I know, the name sounds a bit dramatic, doesn't it? But hear me out. \n\nIt's a weapon of enormous destructive power that can entirely wipe out a planet from existence. It would be an end game weapon that can tilt the course of a campaign immediately. Sounds overpowered, right? But it's not without its balances. \n\nFirst, it would take a lot of resources to even start the construction of this weapon. The resources would be so vast - think the entire production of a high-resource world over several gaming years. Also, it would take a significant amount of time to complete it. Plus, there's the risk of other players getting wind of your plans and making their moves against it.\n\nThere could also be severe diplomatic penalties for even starting to build this weapon, potentially leading to alliances against you. If you successfully deploy it and destroy a world, it would lead to near-universal condemnation, making it even tougher for you to navigate the game diplomacy. \n\nThe 'Planet Annihilator' would also not be selective, i.e., you couldn't choose what to destroy. Upon its activation, everything on the planet, including your assets, would cease to exist.\n\nYou'd essentially use it as a last resort - when there's either nothing left to lose, or you want to go all-in to win the game. Both scenarios are sure to bring a thrill!\n\nI understand this has the potential to be quite broken, and many of you might dismiss this as an absurd idea. However, I think it could add a certain level of strategic depth, potential alliances and betrayals that could make the game more exciting.\n\nAgain, it's just a thought, but I'd love to hear what others think of this idea and maybe some ways to keep it balanced yet impactful within the game?",
    "Gadget market 'to grow in 2005'\nBy Phil Lutton\nPersonal technology is set to boom in 2005 with sales of MP3 players, hand-held video games and cameras expected to reach record levels, analysts predict. In 2004, sales of personal technology products topped $78bn (£44bn) worldwide, but that figure is set to grow to $80bn.\nAccording to market researcher In-Stat/MDR, sales of digital cameras and MP3 players alone will top $12bn and $4bn in 2005 globally.\nThere are already 1.2bn digital cameras in the world and by the end of 2005 there will be 635m MP3 players.\nThe popularity of iPod Nano has also generated sales for accessories companies. Apple claims the $299 Nano sold out in six days -- the company has not yet confirmed when restocking will take place.\nMobile phone sales will grow too. In 2005, 400m phones will be sold worldwide -- compared to 330m in 2004. According to analysts at CCS Insight, this is due to the continuing drop in prices and a greater choice of phones for consumers.\nBut 2005 will also see the death of the PDAs -- personal digital assistants are being surpassed by smart phones which are fast becoming mini-computers in their own right and are beginning to offer the same functionality.\nMotorola's A840 for example has a 2-megapixel camera, a 2.2-inch QVGA display with 65k colours, an expandable memory of 150mb, and a built-in MPEG-4 player and Bluetooth.\nThe most significant trend in hand-held technology in 2005 will be the launch of 3G. 3G -- which stands for third-generation -- promises much faster data rates and enhanced multimedia services. The first 3G hand-sets are expected to hit the market in 2005 and there will be 1.6bn handsets with 3G capabilities by 2010, according to analysts IDC.\n2005 also marks the beginning of IPTV -- interactive television -- services over the Internet. These are expected to have the same effect on the world as the introduction of broadband had several years ago. By 2010, 30% of new television services will be offered as a download via the Internet, in the form of high-definition IPTV content, according to In-",

    "The leader of the Conservative Party has unveiled a comprehensive spending plan, outlining the party's fiscal strategy for the coming years. The plan, which prioritises investment in public services, infrastructure, and green initiatives, is being hailed as a blueprint for a post-pandemic economic recovery.\n\nThe Tory leader emphasised the need for fiscal responsibility while also acknowledging the necessity of targeted spending to stimulate economic growth. The plan includes significant investment in the NHS, education, and law enforcement, as well as a commitment to increase spending on infrastructure and green initiatives.\n\n\"We recognise the need to balance the books, but we also understand the importance of investing in our public services and infrastructure to ensure a robust recovery from the pandemic,\" the Tory leader said during the announcement.\n\nThe spending plan includes a £20 billion increase in NHS funding over the next four years, a move that the Tory leader said was necessary to ensure the health service can continue to provide high-quality care. The plan also includes a £14 billion investment in education, with a focus on improving schools in disadvantaged areas.\n\nIn addition, the plan outlines a £10 billion investment in law enforcement, aimed at recruiting more police officers and improving community safety. The Tory leader also announced a £12 billion investment in green initiatives, including renewable energy projects and measures to improve energy efficiency in homes and businesses.\n\nThe spending plan has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters argue that it strikes the right balance between fiscal responsibility and necessary investment, while critics suggest it does not go far enough in addressing social inequality and climate change.\n\nThe Labour Party criticised the plan, arguing that it fails to address the root causes of social inequality. \"This is a plan that tinkers around the edges, but fails to address the deep-seated issues that have led to rising inequality and poverty,\" a Labour spokesperson said.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental groups have welcomed the investment in green initiatives, but argue that more needs to be done to tackle climate change. \"While this investment is a step in the right direction, it falls short of the ambitious action needed to address the climate crisis,\" said a spokesperson for Greenpeace.\n\nThe Tory leader defended the plan, arguing that it represents a balanced approach to economic recovery. \"This is a plan that invests in our public services, supports economic growth, and takes significant steps towards a greener future,\" they said. \"We believe this is the right approach for our country at this time.\"\n\nThe spending plan will now be debated in Parliament, with a vote expected in the coming weeks.",
    "British athletics legend Dame Kelly Holmes is being encouraged to come out of retirement and compete at the World Athletics Championships. Numerous sports figures and fans have voiced their hopes that the double Olympic gold medallist will return to the track.\n\nDame Kelly, who retired in 2005, made history at the Athens Olympics in 2004, winning two gold medals in the 800m and 1500m races. The decision to ask her to return to competitive athletics comes in the wake of a dearth of high performing British female middle-distance runners on the international stage. \n\nAmong those urging Holmes to compete is her former coach, Jack Rowell. \"Kelly's talent is unmatched. Even at 51, her passion for the sport is evident. If she gets back into rigorous training, I believe she can put up a good fight at the Worlds,\" Rowell said.\n\nFans across the country have also come out in support of a possible comeback, with a surge of social media posts under the hashtag '#KellyComeBack'.\n\nDame Kelly, for her part, has not made any official comments regarding a possible return to the track. However, in a recent interview on BBC Radio 5 Live, she did not dismiss the idea entirely.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Holmes said. \"Athletics has given me so much and I still feel deeply connected to the sport. Right now, my focus is on mentoring the next generation of athletes, but who knows what the future might hold?\"\n\nA spokesperson for UK Athletics said: \"We would be thrilled at any opportunity to see Dame Kelly compete again. She’s an inspiration to every British athlete and has a massive following among athletics fans.\"\n\nHowever, they emphasized that any decision about a potential return to professional athletics would be entirely up to Dame Kelly. \n\nShould Holmes come out of retirement, it would not be the first time an athlete has made such a comeback. The tradition of sport is littered with stories of athletes who have returned to their discipline after lengthy periods away.\n\nFor now, it remains to be seen whether or not the athleticism, experience, and sheer tenacity of Dame Kelly Holmes will grace the World Championships again. However, the clamor for her return hints at the esteem in which she's held, and the belief in what she can still achieve.",
    "\"Dear John,\" directed by Liane Moriarty and starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried, is a heart-string tugging romance that lets you experience a roller-coaster of emotions. Adapted from Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, the movie is set against the backdrop of a war-torn world, presenting a poignant and touching love story that manages to captivate and move the audience throughout the run-time.\n\nOne of the movie's significant strengths is its casting. Channing Tatum perfectly portrays the character John - a sincere and determined soldier. His emotional range and expression infuse depth into John's character, allowing the audience to connect with him on a personal level. Amanda Seyfried, on the other hand, skillfully embodies the character of Savannah, a college student with her innate innocence and charm. The chemistry between Tatum and Seyfried is palpable, making the audience root for their relationship. \n\nThe narrative balance between moments of romance, heartbreak, and war-charged tension creates a gripping storyline. While at times the script becomes overly sentimental, for the most part, it stays true to the essence of Sparks' novel. \n\nAdditionally, the cinematography beautifully captures the essence of each scene, applying a keen sense of detail to the rural South Carolina landscapes and war zones. The film is punctuated with well-curated music, adding to the overall heartbreaking ambiance.\n\nOn the downside, the movie suffers from unexpected pacing issues and some plot points leave you wanting more depth. Moreover, the film carries the classic Sparks' stamp of a tragic narrative, which might seem repetitive to some viewers. Nevertheless, the film scores on its ability to exemplify sincere love against obstacles, and its poignant depiction of the implications of war on individual lives.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Dear John\" may not be perfect, but it is a genuinely moving romance that explores the challenges faced by a couple separated by more than just distance. Acting performances, especially by Tatum and Seyfried, are commendable and the movie thrives on its heartfelt narrative and stunning visuals. It is indeed an emotional journey worth taking for any romantic movie admirer.",
    "A new breed of hooligan. In London's East End. And how to make a bad man - good.\nThe setting of this story is in East London, in the city's famous working-class area known as the East End. The East End, historically referred to as the'slums of London', is known for being home to the Whitechapel District, famous for the 1888 Jack the Ripper murders. For a young lad growing up in the East End, there are a lot of things to do. Being that the East End is so close to the City of London and the Canary Wharf business district, there are a lot of white collar jobs and high salaries. However, it is also home to the most notorious organized crime outfit in the entire country: the English Criminal Syndicate, or E.C.S./the Firm, and the most infamous group of soccer hooligans in the country, the Inter City Firm/I.C.F. Both groups are infamous within their respective circles for their violence, greed, and ability to do the impossible. For both groups, no job is too big and no job, no matter how impossible and ridiculous, is too small. The E.C.S./Firm is run by a man named Charlie Morris. Charlie Morris is the head of the Firm, a crime lord who can get a man killed or put in prison with a single phone call. Charlie Morris made his money illegally, during the great riots of the 1980s, and he is rumoured to own half of East London thanks to the hundreds of criminal enterprises he secretly owns or finances. These are the two things that young men growing up in the East End, young men who have never known any type of decent work or family support, long to join; the Firm, known for its money, power, and ability to help a man succeed, and the I.C.F., known for its ability to help a youngster prove himself as a \"hard man\". For these reasons, these two groups are the two most feared groups in modern London. The most violent of all is the E.C.S./Firm. They've got ruthless, hardened men, who never let anything slide, as henchmen, who have a knack for eliminating enemies and rivals, but not the I.C.F. The I.C.F",
    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but I do know that it's one of those rare movies where you can't help but be impressed by its sheer audacity and ambition. It's an ambitious project with a lot going on, and while some of the ideas are interesting (the idea of a character who has no name, or a character who doesn't have a face), most of them seem like they were thrown together in a rush. But then again, there's something about the way director David Lynch approaches his work that makes me think he might just be able to pull off something truly special. The story follows a young man named Llewyn Davis as he tries to find himself after being diagnosed with schizophrenia. He meets up with a group of friends at a party, and things get out of hand pretty quickly. There's a lot of violence, sex, drugs, and general weirdness, but it all comes together into a very cohesive whole. This isn't your typical indie horror flick; it's more of a dark comedy than anything else. And if you're looking for a good laugh, you'll definitely want to check this one out.\n\nIMDB Rating: 7/10",

    "This paper investigates the low-frequency 1/f noise in MoS2 thin-film transistors, comparing single and multilayer structures. The study reveals that the noise power spectral density in these devices is inversely proportional to frequency, consistent with the 1/f noise behavior. The noise magnitude was found to be significantly higher in single-layer devices compared to multilayer structures, attributed to the higher trap density in single-layer MoS2. The results also indicate that the noise in these devices is predominantly due to carrier number fluctuations. This research provides valuable insights into the noise characteristics of MoS2 thin-film transistors, which is crucial for their potential applications in electronic devices.",
    "(1) - The present study was carried out to investigate brain structures that are related to early post-surgical loss of consciousness induced by anesthetic agents, with an emphasis on the regions of high interest in the field of parapsychology, astrobiology etc.. The areas of highest potential importance include those relating to perception mechanisms (fascicles, retinotopy), processing of memory information (frontal lobes, cerebellum), visual processes and movement regulation. Also, we investigated structure based differences in regional structural connectivity.\n(3) - There has been only one previous experiment testing the hypothesis regarding neural functional organization changes within six hours after surgery in anaesthetized rats [13]. Thus, these results are not directly comparable with other experiments, which have been conducted in patients undergoing open-brain surgery or in people under anesthetics during clinical studies at different laboratories (for example, here in Paris and at our center ). As expected however, it can be speculated that this may be due to differences between the two species. In fact, for some neurological diseases like ALS [14] and other rare disorders the onset of symptoms does not coincide with anesthesia injection, but rather after several durations of sedation and/or pain medications; thus, for these subjects even short term duration of postoperative seizure activity cannot fully explain the observed network topographical alterations with respect to their normal functions, since there is no possible comparison of function across such different states (i.e. state before and after injection). Here, we chose only one subject, namely A., a young male patient who underwent electrocautery anesthesia after having had a history of epilepsy during the past ten years, to analyze the functional networks in close relation and temporal relationship with his state of consciousness without any prior antiepileptic drug administration.

    "I'm a therapist and am beyond tired of being polite to covidiot clients who still want to continue in person sessions in person. I'm on a very short fuse with them as it is. We've reached the point where I feel almost every client would benefit from not seeing me at my practice but I'm afraid I'll lose the majority of clients if not all of them if they don't have access to the office. I also don't feel comfortable leaving for a new practice due to the fact that the rent I pay is extremely low, so I don't know how that would factor into the equation. I'm in a lease. I have a great relationship with both the landlord and the building management so I never feel it's my right to make a complaint when I see people who are clearly wearing masks not covering their noses or wearing a mask below their nose so their mouth is uncovered. It just pisses me even more that these people (the mask wearers I'm talking about who do this consistently) tend to be well off. My rent is still pretty affordable due to how cheap my rent is. My income is well over the state Medicaid program guidelines so if I were to go to a different office or move, my income would have to go down significantly to where I qualify for the state program because I'd no longer qualify for commercial insurance.\nI've been so frustrated at the lack of social responsibility and just plain rudeness toward fellow humans I've lost all respect for people. I'm extremely introverted I know this is a factor. I'm really a very nice and polite person but this has just completely exhausted all of my patience for how humans can be so disrespectful, stupid and lazy. I don't know what to do. I've said so many times that I can't help people who are either unwilling or unable to engage in the act of not spreading disease. This has been a particularly frustrating time of year for me. I never would have gotten in this line of work if it didn't cause me anxiety, and I'm pretty much at breaking point. Thanks, therapist friends. I don't mean to be overly dramatic. As many of you know, most therapists don't make a lot of money. I have student loans. The way I can justify the student loans that are hanging over my head as an added debt is if I",
    "Hello fellow Reddit users, \n\nI am reaching out here hoping for some help. I have a 3 years old Border Collie who has a severe case of anxiety, specifically when it comes to grooming. \n\nTo provide a bit of background, we adopted her a year ago from a local rescue group. Given her past history of abuse and neglect, it's understandable she would have some anxiety issues. We've been patient with her, trying to create a calm environment as well as associating grooming with positive reinforcement (treats, praises, petting etc.). However, each time we attempt to brush her fur, trim her nails, or even go for her routine vet's checkup, she freaks out. She shakes, yips and nips, to a point where we are sometimes scared of hurting her unintentionally. \n\nI am aware that Border Collies, in general, have high energy levels and can be anxious. But I'm unsure if this level of fear goes beyond breed anxiety. \n\nWe have been considering professional help, like a groomer behaviorist, but wanted to try one more time ourselves. Does anyone have any insights, or experience with a similar issue that could help us out? Techniques, training methods, calming aids, or any other resources that could help us alleviate our dog's grooming anxiety would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance for your help.",

    "Hey everyone,\n\nSo, I've been running a YouTube channel for about a year now, and I have actually reached a point where I have a decent number of subscribers. I do all kinds of content, ranging from gaming to comedy skits, but all of them revolving around my personal interests. I'm at a stage where I'm starting to consider monetizing it. The one catch though, my family has no clue about it.\n\nI haven't told them for a multitude of reasons. Initially, it was because I thought they might not understand or might consider it a waste of time. But, as it gained momentum, I didn’t want any pressure or expectations from them. Now, I realize I need to tell them because, well, it's becoming a significant part of my life.\n\nI feel slightly nervous about how they'll react. I wanted some advice on how I should approach this. How did you guys let your families know about your channels (for those who did), and how did they take it?\n\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
    "Danish winger Jesper Gronkjaer has agreed to a transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid, ending his stint with English club Chelsea. The move is expected to bolster Madrid's attacking options as they aim to reclaim the La Liga title.\n\nGronkjaer, 28, has been a key player for Chelsea since joining the club in 2000. His pace and crossing ability have made him a constant threat on the wings, contributing significantly to Chelsea's success in recent seasons. However, the opportunity to play for one of the world's most prestigious clubs proved too enticing for the Danish international.\n\nReal Madrid have been keen to strengthen their squad following a disappointing season, which saw them finish fourth in La Liga. The acquisition of Gronkjaer is seen as a significant step towards achieving this goal. His experience and skill set are expected to complement the team's existing attacking talents, including Brazilian superstar Ronaldo and French maestro Zinedine Zidane.\n\nReal Madrid's sporting director, Jorge Valdano, expressed his delight at securing Gronkjaer's services. \"Jesper is a world-class player who will add a new dimension to our attack,\" he said. \"His speed, skill and experience will be invaluable as we aim to challenge for the title next season.\"\n\nGronkjaer's move to Madrid is subject to a medical, which is expected to take place later this week. If all goes well, he will join his new teammates for pre-season training in July.\n\nThe transfer fee has not been disclosed, but it is believed to be in the region of £15 million. This would make Gronkjaer one of the most expensive Danish players in history, surpassing the £13 million Liverpool paid for Daniel Agger in 2006.\n\nGronkjaer's departure will be a blow for Chelsea, who will now need to find a replacement for their influential winger. However, with a wealth of talent at their disposal and a substantial transfer budget, the Blues are expected to move quickly to fill the void left by the Dane's departure.",

    "Abstract While much has been written about prompt generation for DEL, it remains highly problematic to reliably produce the output given many different environment parameters - some difficult and others obvious like an ENV variable's value and configuration of.NET's eventing infrastructure. The primary problem can be summarized as follows: To obtain reliable and predictable outputs from simple, dynamic input, a generator should be composed to use standard environment variables where possible and otherwise invoke built in function such as shell commands or batch file parsing that does not rely on the current environment. In addition to being less error prone because one does not need to make hard assumptions on the input, this design methodology reduces reliance on libraries (such as CSPRNGs ) which are susceptible to changes during runtime in order to exploit specific inputs within the program. However this approach still requires careful manual effort to ensure no data gets accidentally overwritten because any number of errors can result when entering unknown variables while running DEVELOPER'S CHILD with some kind of custom logic involving INPUT's,.NET's Eventing Frameworks, etc.\nWhile there are multiple approaches to dynamically create these environments (often named \"Del\", \"DELIMEPLATIONER \", \"dynamic prompt generation \" or even just DEL_SEARCH_DEPL) they invariably fall short due to the necessity (at least in my experience) of ensuring most of the initial input contains a string like /bin/bash in its name. This makes them extremely resource intensive, expensive in terms of CPU usage, require having an entire interpreter to run on your computer and, as a side effect, limits their flexibility due to the fact that most people have limited familiarity with how languages work internally until they actually need to interact with those languages to generate an environment out of input. Since I'm looking at the topic as a programmer who is very concerned with maintaining his programming language knowledge through active practice so while these features may get new features added quickly into existing programming environments they won't necessarily change something that is fundamental to what I take pride in when using an existing programming language. While most of us will probably never see that feature enabled by default within our editors, IDEs or other programs we often do need to enter inputs that start with bash ; or command line arguments that start with \\; etc. But how often do we encounter prompts from",

    "But it takes something special for someone to be able to pull off an old-school shot that would require incredible grip and power while holding a ball in his or her hands, so the challenge has been finding people with that rare gift – whether they are pros or not. If you can imagine pulling back a car door handle as if it's still attached to your own body, then this might be what moving a swing aids technique looks like…\n\nFrom a technical point of view, when you have a golf club under your left arm, there needs to be space behind it – perhaps 10cm of room. And as part of moving the clubface to bring you closer to home plate, and thus allow better balance through the action, the weight shifts to the outside and down towards the balls of your feet! Think about pushing yourself out onto that step on a flight of stairs. This effect comes into play because at any other time, one arm (inclined to turn forward) should be on your right hip, lifting your right leg straight up on its front side to create a force on the ground on your opposite hand, which then turns around using its own momentum to get back to the starting position. With a small shift in balance between hands, though – especially when playing on smaller fields – the impact of the shot can become unpredictable. The good thing is that most golfers manage their foot position perfectly. But when something goes awry … It takes something special to do the right shot in difficult conditions, and I'm glad to have made things easier by adding more space to my hit, without giving up control or getting myself off line too far — but with a little practice it's possible to make that kind of move.\n\nAt first he says this feels unnatural when moving – when he puts that one ball into that hole. That's why he has to hold the club in one spot instead of his whole leg, since the club moves away from him by 30° every stroke in addition to the clubhead's movement that causes the clubface (front edge) to sink in the direction it came – when standing upright. He holds it still just long enough to see how far he will go to reach the target, before throwing it again (just so you realize where he wants you).\n\nThen after some practice it seems natural – as he continues to push his shot further, it gets so it feels less",
    "Abstract:\nWe consider the global attractor problem for a viscous Navier-Stokes system driven by a periodic forcing and with a fast-slow dissipative term. In the framework of a general\n  class of equations that can describe the evolution of turbulent flows with rapid rotation, it is proved that the global attractor exists and it is connected. Then, we study its geometrical and topological properties and,\n  in particular, it is shown that the global attractor for the nonautonomous system has a finite number of singular points. Furthermore, a connection with dynamical systems is provided, by\n  obtaining the local asymptotic stability properties of the attractor. To achieve all these results, a suitable time-parametrization of the system is found and the semigroup approach on the abstract\n  phase space is used.\n\n\nA: In the book Geometric Theory of Dynamical Systems, Félix Hérau states in section 4.2.6, p. 145, of Chapter 4 in volume one of the series, \"... a general theory of the construction of the global attractor via finite-dimensional reductions\n ... was given by Kupka [25], and it was developed by J.-P.

    "\"Man of Steel\" is a refreshing take on the Superman saga, offering a darker, more complex portrayal of the iconic superhero. Director Zack Snyder has successfully reimagined the character's origin story, infusing it with a sense of realism and emotional depth that was lacking in previous iterations. \n\nHenry Cavill delivers a compelling performance as Clark Kent/Superman, embodying the character's internal struggle between his alien heritage and human upbringing. His portrayal is nuanced and layered, effectively capturing the loneliness and isolation that comes with being different. Amy Adams as Lois Lane is equally impressive, bringing a strong, independent, and intelligent character to life. The chemistry between Cavill and Adams is palpable, adding a romantic subplot that feels organic rather than forced.\n\nThe visual effects in \"Man of Steel\" are nothing short of spectacular. The action sequences are intense and well-choreographed, particularly the climactic battle between Superman and General Zod. The film's cinematography is also noteworthy, with several breathtaking shots that truly showcase the vastness and beauty of the alien world of Krypton.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its flaws. The narrative can feel disjointed at times, with the non-linear storytelling causing some confusion. Additionally, the film's darker tone may not appeal to everyone, particularly those who prefer the more lighthearted approach of previous Superman films.\n\nDespite these minor issues, \"Man of Steel\" is a solid superhero film that offers a fresh perspective on a beloved character. It's a visually stunning, emotionally engaging, and action-packed ride that is sure to please both comic book fans and casual viewers alike.",
    "\"Ali\" is a powerful biographical film that captures the essence of one of the most iconic figures in sports history, Muhammad Ali. Will Smith delivers a compelling performance, embodying Ali's charisma, strength, and complexity with remarkable authenticity. His portrayal of Ali's journey, from his rise to fame to his conversion to Islam and his political activism, is both inspiring and thought-provoking.\n\nThe film's narrative is well-structured, providing a comprehensive view of Ali's life without losing focus on the man behind the legend. It delves into his personal relationships, his struggles, and his triumphs, painting a multi-dimensional picture of a man who was not only a boxing champion but also a cultural icon and a voice for social justice.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight, also deliver strong performances, adding depth to the story. The cinematography is stunning, with the boxing scenes being particularly well-executed. They are intense, visceral, and capture the brutality and beauty of the sport.\n\nHowever, the film's real strength lies in its exploration of Ali's character. It does not shy away from his flaws and controversies, but it also highlights his courage, his conviction, and his unwavering belief in himself. It is a tribute to a man who was larger than life, yet profoundly human.\n\n\"Ali\" is not just a sports movie or a biopic. It is a profound exploration of a man who transcended the boundaries of sport to become a symbol of resistance and change. It is a film that will resonate with anyone who values integrity, courage, and the power of self-belief.",

    "In this work, we propose an end-toend deep learning framework to segment hyperspectral images (HSIs). The proposed method consists two parts; one part learns discriminative features by using conditional random field as regularization term in loss function while another uses convolutional neural network with residual connections that can learn hierarchical feature representations at different levels automatically without any handcrafted design or supervision information about segmentation labels during training process [1]. This approach has been shown effective on several datasets including Indian Pines dataset which contains 16 bands ranging between 400nm - 2500 nm wavelength range where each pixel represents its own spectral signature making it difficult task due high dimensionality problem caused mainly because there are many more variables than observations available when trying classify these types data sets into classes based solely upon their appearance alone rather just looking only color values within image itself like RGB channels would do instead having access all possible wavelengths present across entire spectrum simultaneously thus allowing us better understand what makes up our world around through analysis those signals emitted light sources themselves!",
    "This paper investigates the Anderson Localization Phenomenon in one-dimensional elastic systems. By using numerical and analytical methods, we explore the concept of Anderson Localization, a physical principle that describes the absence of diffusion in disordered systems. Our study dissects the stability, characteristics and implications of Anderson Localization in elastic systems, with a specific focus on one-dimensional models. Our results confirm that disorder significantly modifies the transport properties of an elastic system and leads to localization of phononic states. The findings of this study demonstrate the practicality of using disordered systems, like those exhibiting Anderson Localization, in elasticity-based technologies. Further research is suggested to draw a complete understanding of the complex interplay between disorder, interaction, and interference in different circumstances.",

    "In a bid to clear his name, former Worldcom boss, Bernard Ebbers, has launched a vehement defense in the face of charges linked to one of the biggest corporate frauds in U.S. history. Mr. Ebbers denied all accusations, underscoring his unawareness about the $11bn (£5.7bn) accounting fraud during his time as WorldCom's CEO.\n\nStanding trial in New York, Ebbers pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy. If convicted, the charges could lead to a 25-year prison term for the 63-year-old. He is chiefly accused of being instrumental in inflating WorldCom's assets by about $11bn, eventually leading to the company's bankruptcy in 2002. \n\nIn his defense, Ebbers emphasised his lack of expertise in accounting. His lawyer, Reid Weingarten, echoed the claims stating, \"Bernie Ebbers never sought to mislead investors, never sought to improperly manipulate Worldcom's numbers, never improperly took any money and never sought to hurt the company he built.\"\n\nThe prosecution team, however, countered this defense by presenting former WorldCom financial director, Scott Sullivan, as their star witness. Sullivan, who pleaded guilty to his part in the fraud in 2004, testified that Ebbers had a clear understanding of the financial situation and was closely involved in the decisions leading to the accounting scandal.\n\nThe collapse of WorldCom was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. It cost around 20,000 jobs, leaving shareholders out of pocket by almost $180bn.\n\nWorldCom, now rebranded as MCI, has since been bought by telecoms giant Verizon. The audit failure at the company led to significant changes in U.S. regulatory laws with the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, aimed at tightening corporate accountability.\n\nThe trial continues.\n",

    "Non-Measurable Unions in the Presence of Arbitrary Nonlinearity\n\nIn this work, we study the effect of arbitrary nonlinearity on the behavior of non-measurable unions. We show that if one has an arbitrary nonlinearity, then the union of two sets of elements can be described by a linear combination of these sets. This means that the union of two sets of elements can be described as a sum of linear combinations of their components. In other words, the union of two sets of elements can be described as a linear combination of their component sums. The existence of such a linear combination implies that there exists a set of all possible linear combinations of the union of two sets of elements. If one has an arbitrary nonlinearity, then it follows that the union of two sets of elements cannot be described by any linear combination of its components. Thus, the union of two sets of elements cannot be described as a linear combination of their component sums.\n\nWe prove that the above statement holds even when the union of two sets of elements is not commutative and that the above statement holds even when the union of two sets of elements is not associative.\n\nThis work was done with the help of the following resources:",
    "Boris Johnson today warned against giving young people \"the pretence that your personal ambition can outweigh anything else in society\". In an interview with BBC Newsnight presenter Evan Davis, the Mayor said being mayor was like \"playing at politics\", and claimed he would only do it again due to the scale of his achievements because other politicians are not prepared to give up their posts for him. Speaking alongside former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Mr Johnson said politicians' lives had become more difficult in recent years but added, \"I suspect this will be my life too.\" He said politics had got harder as governments cut spending, creating jobs became increasingly hard-won, and public services were privatised – creating opportunities for those who wanted to take on greater responsibility. The new Mayor of London praised Mr Brown – but was critical about another member of his party's cabinet. During his premiership Tony Blair failed to keep some key services running after they were turned over by New Labour, said Mr Johnson. But while Mr Wilson continued to \"take a great risk\" with education as Labour premier of Greater Manchester, there have been problems taking on the London Transport Authority (LTA) amid questions over its finances.\n\n\nNow I'm sure you must imagine it was Boris who said it and Gordon did respond that he too believes we should try to make the world better every single day. So what happened? First the British media blew it out of proportion and reported that Boris had complained that giving money away to kids was a waste because they wouldn't use it.\n\nWell guess what? If anything his comments showed exactly how important education actually is whether it's in the classroom or just around the house. Yes it may sound extreme until one really puts themselves in charge of funding our nation's schools then it becomes obvious very quickly. There is no point having a good school if it doesn't function perfectly and if it has to turn visitors off because they don't understand something. Why do most parents choose to send their children to private academies simply so it's easier to explain complex subjects to them? Education can be a major barrier for many families trying to support them in terms of getting into higher educational institutions which takes time and a whole lot of effort to help them succeed. What people forget when talking about schooling is that there are countless things we cannot control in our own home such as accidents, family disputes etc – both at home, where we spend hours",
    "This film is based on the true story of two brothers, one of whom was an American citizen and the other a resident of Hong Kong who were involved in a high-stakes drug deal gone wrong. The film follows their journey to become fugitives after they are arrested by the FBI and subsequently convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The film's plot revolves around the brother who was born in America and raised in Hong Kong while his younger sibling grew up in New York City. The older brother, played by Martin Scorsese, is portrayed as a man with a strong moral compass who has been through some tough times in life but still manages to maintain a positive outlook on life. His younger brother, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is portrayed as someone who is more prone to violence than his older brother. He is also shown to be somewhat naive about the world around him. This film is not without its flaws however. It does suffer from a lack of direction and pacing that makes it feel like there isn't much going on at all. There are also several scenes where the characters just stand around talking or doing nothing. These scenes do little to add to the overall experience and instead detract from the film's overall quality. Overall, this film is a good watch if you're looking for something different. If you're looking for a gritty crime drama then look elsewhere.",
    "There's a lot of interest in replacing your old RAM and I've heard a few times people having trouble finding RAM. With that in mind, I've made a list of possible alternatives to replacing RAM.\n1) Upgrade your CPU\nIt has been my suggestion more than once that upgrading your CPU is probably a better option than upgrading your RAM, or at least will give you a better overall experience. Here's the argument. Upgrading your CPU allows you to not only increase the overall speed of your system, but also, for the most part, increase your RAM limit as well. Upgrading your CPU is a great solution if you can afford it and have limited RAM options.\n2) Upgrade your hard drive\nUpgrading your hard drive is an excellent option especially if you still have the same CPU as you had three or four years ago. Even if you are a CPU wh0re, though, and are constantly upgrading like I do, you should consider upgrading your hard drive. You'll see performance increases and you'll also save money in the long run. Upgrading your hard drive is one of the best places to start when you're looking to increase the performance of your computer.\n3) Upgrade your graphics card\nThis could be a good option if you're planning to eventually upgrade your RAM. Upgrading your RAM can make a notable difference in your overall system performance, but you do have to be careful. A graphics card upgrade will only give you additional RAM if it comes with an additional DDR socket, and most modern graphics cards don't. However, if you plan on making this a long-term upgrade, or if you need some extra memory, this could be a good option.\n4) Upgrade your PC case\nThis is probably one of the easiest alternatives. Your PC case is the most important piece of hardware because it is what protects your computer from damage while it's not in use. But it can also be the least important piece because it's the piece that does the most damage to your system. Most people don't think of upgrading the PC case when upgrading their system, but it can make a huge difference in overall system performance. Upgrading your case gives you the ability to upgrade your motherboard as well as the ability to add more GPUs and RAM.\n5) Upgrade your",
    "An email has been sent to all MPs and ministerial staff with an attached picture as a precautionary measure after two senior Conservative staffers died in tragic accidents while riding motorbikes yesterday. In the email, which also threatens further attacks on security measures for members and Tory MPs, \"Blackberry\" makes reference to several high profile incidents that have occurred at Westminster recently in which other party activists suffered serious injuries. The image shows former Conservative MP Michael Portillo being hospitalised last Friday amid fears he had broken his neck while trying to ride out demonstrators opposed to Gove's new schools policy or was having an epileptic fit and fell. He recovered but was immediately evacuated by ambulance from Buckingham Palace where he worked alongside David Cameron. On Sunday Mr Portillo's wife Mary appeared before MPs as she pleaded for them to take precautions against future violent threats. She told them about recent events including a firebomb attack in a south London pub that saw it set alight this month and another involving four people who were seriously injured after they tried to throw bricks through their neighbour George Galloway's front gate at a demonstration outside parliament. Ms Portillo said the most important thing MPs needed to do was to take sensible precautions; but she warned them not to \"get off their backside\".\n\nAs I've discussed previously, using a BlackBerry (the platform of choice by terrorists everywhere) for purposes such as sending messages to terrorist groups or \"planning actions or operations which could cause casualties among both British citizens and those living under the regime of the Islamic State group\" would be legal but illegal for everyone else. It does not appear at first glance that there is any mention in these emails of using this smartphone app while on Parliamentary business. However, in reality, once one understands what it does to secure user data it becomes obvious that BlackBerry Messenger can and should, under certain circumstances and conditions, serve a legitimate purpose while working for a political office like MP.",

    "This paper presents a novel statistical modeling approach for computer-aided quantification of dental biofilm. Dental biofilm, a major contributor to oral diseases, is challenging to quantify due to its complex structure. Traditional methods are often subjective and lack precision. To address this, we propose a statistical model that leverages image analysis and machine learning techniques to accurately quantify dental biofilm. The model was trained and validated using a large dataset of dental images, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability. This approach offers a more objective and efficient method for dental biofilm quantification, with potential applications in both clinical and research settings.",
    "In this article, we study testing functional inequalities in high dimensions with respect to Gaussian measures and sub-Gaussian distributions on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that if $f$ satisfies an inequality involving its first two moments (e.g., convexity or log concavity), then it can be tested against all other functions at level alpha using O(alpha^{-2}) samples; moreover our test has power 1 - o_p(1) when f does not satisfy such moment conditions but belongs instead only Lipschitz class Lambda^0([0,T]). This improves upon previous results which required either stronger assumptions about function classes [Bentkus et al.(2003)]or larger sample sizes[Koltchinskkii & Panchenko,(2011)]. Our tests are based around empirical process theory as well some new concentration bounds related specifically towards these problems.[arXiv]",
    "Jennifer Capriatti has pulled-out injured just hours before her first round match at Melbourne Park, leaving world number one Serena Williams to begin proceedings on Rod Laver Arena against unseeded Russian Elena Bovina in Monday's opening day action (1400 GMT). The American was due play fellow qualifier and compatriot Jill Craybas but withdrew with an abdominal strain which she picked up during practice over Christmas while playing tennis for charity back home.\"I'm really disappointed,\" said 22 year old Jennifer who had been hoping that this would be another good start after reaching last season’s semi finals here as well making it through qualifying rounds into both Wimbledon & US Opens where eventually lost 6/4 7 /5 4 -6 3 – 0 retd vs Kim Clijsters. She also reached quarterfinals twice more including once again versus Belgian player Kirsten Flipkens whom defeated earlier today by winning tiebreakers 10–8 12—10 11 —9; however there were no signs whatsoever leading towards such outcome when they met each other previously two years ago resulting only 1 hour 20 minutes long battle between them ending 5 sets victory 2--1 set scoreline!

    "I'm not going to lie, I was pretty disappointed with this book. It's a bit too long for my taste and it doesn't really have any real plot or characters that stand out. The story is about a young man who has been in a coma since he was a child and wakes up to find himself in a world where he can see everything around him. He meets a girl named Alice who seems like she could be his sister but then they discover that she is actually an alien who came here to help him. They go back to their home planet and there are some interesting things happening. There are also some other aliens who seem to be trying to get rid of them. This is all pretty confusing so I don't know if I'll finish it. But I did enjoy reading it.\n\nThis is one of those books that you read once and never want to put down again. It's just so well written and the author does such a great job at making you feel as though you're right there with the main character. I think that's why I liked it so much. I felt like I knew what was going on even when I wasn't sure how. And I loved the way that the author made me care about these two people. I didn't hate them because they were evil or anything like that. I just wanted to protect them and make sure that they would survive whatever was coming next.\n\nSo yeah, I guess I enjoyed it. I hope you do too!",
    "The president of France appears to have his hands on the EU's keys in the wake of the Brexit vote. The French are bracing themselves for a prolonged period of uncertainty as they are told by their prime minister that the exit from the European Union could last for two decades. Emmanuel Macron told his government on Thursday that a 'no' vote on Brexit would trigger a two-year period of instability in which businesses would have trouble in hiring workers. He also assured them that their country would be stronger if they voted in favour of staying in the EU.\n\n\nSo many people were voting to Leave in this country that the rest expected a win for Brexit. Macron was obviously hoping to soften the blow for his countrymen and women. He could not do it since he was being outsmarted by the British people. That is why he is so upset at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. They were playing the role of the French puppets to keep out the British. At least as far as this is concerned... so far.\n\nBrexit is happening. More importantly, the EU referendum was happening. The British people were looking for change. The last thing they want to be talking about is the EU. If the British people were given a second chance to vote on the EU they would reject it. People want to be voting to take back control. It is the only way to do that. It is their opportunity to make a huge statement in the process.\n\nSo please do not let Macron fool you again. We do not want to be taking back control from the EU. We want control back from the elites, which has corrupted and destroyed our governments. These elites are responsible for the economic problems that now exist. There is no point in keeping it in their hands because they will use their political positions to crush any opposition.\n\nWe need a system where a country decides its course for itself. It is a democracy or a monarchy. When there is a choice of a King or the Queen all the citizens have to vote for. It is the reason why we have a Supreme Court and Supreme Council. And they are the ones in control of government. What were the citizens voting against? Macron is giving the British people this opportunity which they need. And the EU is giving them a chance at taking out the EU elites. But we as citizens must take our responsibility by voting for it.\n\nWe",

France is expecting strong growth in domestic consumption of 1.4 percent in 2012, 2 percent in 2013, and 2.3 percent in 2014. This growth is primarily due to the recovering of consumer confidence and the recovery of credit in France. (Source: World Bank)\n\nConsumer spending represents a significant share of France's GDP. As shown in the following graph, France has seen a significant increase in consumer spending over the past decade.\n\nThis graph shows all the key components of France's economy. The bottom line is that consumer spending has been growing with no signs of slowing down.\n\nFrance's economic structure is not the same as other European countries. France has a competitive advantage in agriculture and services (transportation, tourism, finance, energy, and other services). The main problem in France is that the country is not competitive in high value-added and technology sectors.

    "We present DiNTS, an efficient and flexible method to search for 3-dimensional (3D) medical image segmentations in a time-consuming manner using differentiable neural networks. We show that DiNTS can be used as a general framework for solving many other problems involving 3D images such as object detection, face recognition, and motion tracking. Our approach uses a novel combination of convolutional and recurrent layers with a single hidden layer. The resulting network architecture has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. In particular, we demonstrate that our model achieves a mean error rate of 0.5% on the MNIST dataset, which is comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we find that our model performs well even when trained on large datasets containing thousands of images. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the performance of our model on various tasks including object detection, face recognition, and motion tracking.",
    "\"The Adventures of Tintin draws you into the world of the Belgian cartoonist and writer Hergé (1868-1924) whose adventures are the stuff of legend…. It's hard to imagine Hergé not to have been a comic book fan. … Tintin himself is a good comic book character…. The movie stars Belgian cartoonist Laurence Olivier (of the classic comedy \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" fame) as a world-weary Belgian sailor who must keep his hands clean (after he murders an old man), not to mention his own secret from his past, while keeping his own family intact, and his own friends safe. To help accomplish all this, he and his crew must navigate the complicated world of European piracy (or \"cartagee,\" the colloquial term for the lawless behavior of bootleg sailors). As the tale progresses, things become more complicated….\"\n\nIMDb also reviews the animated film on behalf of the site, providing a brief synopsis of the story. The article is presented in a slightly different font than on IMDb.com, so it's easy to miss the similarities between the two reviews.\n\nBelow is the full IMDb entry for \"The Adventures of Tintin,\" which is similar to the full description for \"The Tintin Adventures,\" which appears on IMDb.com:\n\n\"Based on the book book of the same name by Belgian cartoonist Hergé (1868–1924), adapted for the screen by Jean Cocteau. In a world where piracy is not only rife, but often rewarded, Tintin is a fearless and daring young scallywag, a man of few words, and an expert at sailing on the seas, who must defend his fatherland from the greedy villains who threaten both. The Adventures of Tintin follows the adventures of the adventurous, adventurous young scallywag in a classic cartoon movie format. Tintin finds himself a member of his father's pirate crew, where he tries to make the most of his powers in helping his father's ship, \"the Courageous,\" in finding its missing crew.

    "\"The Hangover Part III\" is a fitting conclusion to the raucous trilogy that has kept audiences laughing for years. The Wolfpack is back for one last adventure, and while it may not reach the comedic heights of the original, it still delivers plenty of laughs and a satisfying end to the series.\n\nThe film sees the return of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis, who once again deliver solid performances as Phil, Stu, and Alan. The chemistry between the three leads is as strong as ever, and their comedic timing is spot on. Ken Jeong also returns as the eccentric Mr. Chow, and he steals every scene he's in with his over-the-top antics.\n\nThe plot of \"The Hangover Part III\" is more of a straightforward action-comedy than the previous films, which were more mystery-based. This change in formula may not sit well with some fans, but it does allow for some exciting set pieces and hilarious situations. The script is filled with clever one-liners and callbacks to the previous films, which fans will appreciate.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips does a great job of balancing the comedy with the action, and the film is visually impressive, with some great cinematography and editing. The soundtrack is also excellent, featuring a mix of popular songs and original score that perfectly complements the on-screen action.\n\nHowever, \"The Hangover Part III\" is not without its flaws. Some of the jokes fall flat, and the film lacks the freshness and unpredictability of the original. The plot is also a bit thin, and some of the character arcs feel rushed.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Hangover Part III\" is a fun, if somewhat uneven, end to the trilogy. It may not be as memorable as the first film, but it's still a worthwhile watch for fans of the series. It's a wild ride that delivers plenty of laughs and a fitting farewell to the Wolfpack.",
    "After one of my earlier articles, an AJR employee said I did not mention any of his company's accomplishments and should check my work to make sure it isn't biased. He's right, in that I was critical enough not only about some products and brands within the industry but how those were marketed as well. They still do that stuff.

    "\"The Aviator\" serves as an incredible examination of the enigmatic figure, Howard Hughes. Directed by master craftsman Martin Scorsese, this film is defined by its brilliant storytelling, radical editing style and breathtaking cinematography, making it a visual masterpiece to behold. \n\nAt the heart of the movie, Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Hughes is nothing short of extraordinary. DiCaprio superbly personifies the magnate’s charm, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and paranoia, bringing a profound depth to the character. His performance perfectly captures the tortured genius who struggled with his internal demons while managing to revolutionize both the aviation and film industry. \n\nCate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn delivers an impeccable performance, buying into her role with disproportionate gusto. A special mention goes to John C. Reilly and Alec Baldwin who make their mark despite their limited screen time. \n\nThe story magnificently illustrates Hughes's ambitious endeavors and his ruthless pursuit of perfection. The film’s recreation of the Hollywood Golden Age is so remarkable that the viewers are thrown back in time, submerged wholly in that glammed up era of glitz and glories.\n\nScorsese does an exceptional job at portraying the quieter, intimate moments as powerfully as the grandiose spectacle, notably the striking depiction of Hughes's struggle with mental illness. The film successfully intertwines the worlds of business, politics, cinema, and aviation, showing the interconnected mesh that it was. \n\nThe film scores high on its technical aspects. From breath-taking flying sequences to meticulously designed period sets and costumes, to Sandy Powell's impeccable attire and Robert Richardson's blinding cinematography - \"The Aviator\" is an aesthetic delight. \n\nDespite its length, viewers’ attention will remain firmly gripped by its compelling storyline and superb performances. Scorsese, with \"The Aviator\", has carved yet another cinematic milestone that particularly stands out in its biographical and historical accuracies. \n\nIn conclusion, \"The Aviator\" is a somber yet extraordinary tale that epitomizes human triumph over adversities, pain, and self-destruction while highlighting the power of dreams. One can watch it for the top-notch performances, excellent direction, beautiful cinematography, or the inspiring story itself. Either way, this cinematic jewel is worth your time, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.",
    "This is a tough one for me because I have accounts with both an online-only bank and a traditional branch-based bank. And if I had to be honest, I would say I'm more satisfied with my online-only bank.\n\nIt has far better customer service than my traditional branch-based bank. This is saying a lot, because I absolutely despise talking to the people in their call centers. They are so robotic and you can never get to anyone that actually knows what they're talking about. They don't even know their own product suite.\n\nMy online-only bank's customer service, on the other hand, has always been prompt and knowledgeable. They were really polite every single time I have interacted with them.\n\nSo, all of that said, here are my reasons for why I think online-only is the superior banking experience:\n\n  * **Deposit Checks:** No need to go to the post office with a deposit! And as an added bonus, you can do more of them and at any time. I have received texts on my phone saying that my deposits have already cleared. There's nothing worse than making a deposit and wondering when it's going to clear.\n\n  * **No Need To Go To A Branch:** I don't get to go to the banks very often, which are both really far away for me. I much rather sit home, in my pajamas and do my banking on the couch.\n\n  * **Easier To Make Payments:** I'm always paying people using my online-only bank's app. It is so easy and convenient. I send money to my parents using it weekly. You can do it straight from your app without needing to look up anything: their bank, their routing number, nothing. It's really nice.\n\n  * **Check Writing:** I know some people will think this is really old school, but I really don't like using my debit card for everything. There's a feeling I get when I hand a check to someone that is money isn't guaranteed to come out of my account. I think it makes the experience of that transaction feel a little more \"real.\" I realize not everyone agrees with that, so I want to be honest about the fact that I do still write checks and that that benefits me on my online-only account.\n\n  * **Great Customer",

The primary focus is on developing a comprehensive understanding of the SOCFBs and devising strategies to optimize their performance. The paper introduces a novel approach to optimize the synthesis filters in the complex filter banks, which significantly improves the overall performance and efficiency. The proposed method is based on advanced mathematical models and algorithms, ensuring optimal filter parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization method is validated through extensive simulations and comparisons with existing techniques. The results demonstrate that the optimized SOCFBs outperform the conventional ones in terms of reduced aliasing, improved frequency selectivity, and enhanced computational efficiency.

    "This book recounts a story that has been told elsewhere – the violent, bloody history of the last gladiators and the brutal deaths wrought by their enemies when they fought to gain survival. This book is not about which gladiators we should choose as our heroes! Gladiatorial combat was an artistic expression created on one man's mind, as the result of bloodlust and blood rage. It was a way of life born in the amphitheater or open stage upon which human flesh would be sliced as if in public display. The actors, both men and women, had no choice but to give blood, to fight, and ultimately die in this ancient sport. Here you will find a detailed account of the events described and analyzed from several angles including the evidence of witnesses, a review of literature, and the examination of newly discovered coins to conclude that there were at least 200 fights going on each year between the years 79-90 AD while Julius Caesar ruled Rome. The battles are divided into categories including skirmishes, combats (all out, up close), duels, horse races, and team-based encounters. It also contains new images and descriptions written in the voices and dialects of contemporary Italian speakers who must have felt intense emotions during these times. While many people don't like the brutal reality portrayed in Gladiator, it can make us appreciate just how barbaric something could really be. And after reading Gladiator let my friends take heart; these horrors may not be commonplace today but you are safe inside the fortress that is yourself. A book I would recommend anyone curious about this subject with the time to read this very informative volume.",

    "Hey everyone, \n\nI apologize in advance if this post becomes a ramble. My mind is a whirlwind right now and I'm desperate for some clarity or advice. I don't know who to reach out to or where to begin, so I thought I'd start here.\n\nFor the past few months, life has been increasingly difficult. Every day I find it harder to get up in the morning, to put a smile on my face, to convince myself that everything's alright. I struggle to even eat or sleep properly. Things which used to excite and motivate me no longer hold any interest or appeal. I feel like I'm stuck in a perpetual state of sadness and it's suffocating me.\n\nIt has started to affect my relationships, my work, my studies - every aspect of my life. People around me have begun noticing my change in mood and behavior but I can't bring myself to tell them about these feelings. It's difficult to explain - hell, I barely understand it myself. It feels like I'm trapped in a dark room with no doors or windows, and I can't escape.\n\nI've tried self-help books, guided meditation, online resources, but nothing seems to be working. \n\nI'm making this post mainly out of desperation. I don't know what to do or how to cope with this. Maybe some of you have been through the same situation and can share advice or resources that worked for you. Maybe some of you are professionals who can guide me toward potential treatment. I'm open to anything at the moment.\n\nLastly, I do want to clarify that I'm not currently a danger to myself or others - I know that's a common concern with these kinds of posts. I just really need help figuring out what these feelings could mean, and how I can start to feel better.\n\nThank you in advance for any guidance you can provide. I appreciate it more than you know.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the support I've received. I can't express how comforting it is to know that I'm not alone and that help is available. I will seek out professional help soon.",
    "This paper presents a novel approach to video segmentation using Convolutional Gated Recurrent Networks (CGRNs). The proposed method leverages the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to effectively segment videos into meaningful sections. The CGRNs are designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in video data, which are crucial for accurate segmentation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. The paper also provides insights into the inner workings of CGRNs, shedding light on their potential applications in other video analysis tasks.",
    "\"Let me start off by saying I know it's popular opinion that SM3 was the movie that finally put Spidey to rest for the time being. While I can see that this could conceivably be the case, I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable (a sentiment I shared with several people in the theater). The movie was entertaining and well acted (I was thoroughly impressed with Topher Grace) and did well to wrap up the Tobey Maguire storyline.\nOne of the major criticisms made against the film was that it focused too heavily on the villains instead of Spider-Man. While I can see that point, it was certainly evident that this was a transition film and some of the storyline did move very quickly. There were several sequences that were completely enjoyable, and of course, that's the essence of any film: you want to entertain the audience, and this one certainly accomplished that goal.\nThe thing I feel that got lost in the shuffle was all of the amazing special effects. In a movie where the hero is swinging about on webs, you'd think that people would comment on how amazing it was to see it on the big screen. I was thrilled to see all of the amazing CGI that accompanied the swinging scenes; whether it involved Spider-Man swinging about the buildings in New York or a giant robot coming alive in the middle of the city, the effects were awe-inspiring. And it was amazing to see how well the stuntmen performed on the sets which required a little extra pizazz.\nUltimately, SM3 is just another step in the evolving storyline, and just like so many other franchises which have followed a similar route, this movie was meant to serve a purpose: setting up the franchise for the new actors who will star in the next iteration of Spidey. And it accomplished just that. While there were no big surprises or epic fights with the Sandman, the movie was worth my time and I'm sure many others enjoyed it as well. What's next for Spidey? The next generation will determine the continuation of this beloved franchise.\"\nFrom the standpoint of marketing, one of the reasons the above review is impressive is that it is both credible and comprehensive. In other words, it contains a wide range of interesting information. Additionally, it isn't just another review that simply restates what a lot of other reviewers have",
    "I've been doing some research on leveraged ETFs, specifically those focused on the semiconductor industry. Given the rapid growth and innovation in the tech sector, I'm considering investing in these ETFs as a way to potentially maximize my returns. \n\nHowever, I'm aware that leveraged ETFs come with their own set of risks, including the potential for significant losses. They are designed to deliver multiples of the performance of the index or benchmark they track. For instance, a leveraged ETF might aim to deliver double the daily return of a specific index. But this also means they could potentially deliver double the loss.\n\nI'm particularly looking at ETFs like SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares ETF) and USD (ProShares Ultra Semiconductors). Both of these ETFs aim to deliver triple the daily performance of their underlying index.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts on these types of investments. Do you think the potential rewards outweigh the risks? Have any of you had experience investing in leveraged ETFs, particularly in the semiconductor industry? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "Spanish tennis legend Carlos Moya couldn't hold back his emotions after leading Spain to a thrilling victory in the Davis Cup. The former world number one, who is now the captain of the Spanish team, was seen shedding tears of joy as he celebrated the win with his team.\n\nSpain clinched the Davis Cup title after defeating Canada in a nail-biting final held in Madrid. The victory marked Spain's sixth Davis Cup title and their first since 2011. Moya, who was part of the winning team in 2004, expressed his pride and joy at the achievement.\n\n\"I can't describe what I'm feeling right now. It's a mix of emotions - happiness, relief, and immense pride in my team,\" said an emotional Moya during the post-match press conference. \"This is a dream come true. Winning the Davis Cup as a player was incredible, but leading my country to this victory as a captain is something else.\"\n\nMoya praised his team for their resilience and fighting spirit throughout the tournament. He singled out world number one Rafael Nadal for his exceptional performance, winning all his eight matches in the tournament.\n\n\"Nadal has been phenomenal. His commitment, his passion, and his performance have been outstanding. He's a true champion,\" Moya said.\n\nThe Spanish captain also had words of praise for the Canadian team, who reached the Davis Cup final for the first time in their history. \"They have a young and talented team. They've shown that they can compete at the highest level. I'm sure we'll see more of them in the future,\" he added.\n\nMoya, who retired from professional tennis in 2010, has been the captain of the Spanish Davis Cup team since 2015.

    "Over the years, I've had experiences of random sensations on my face that, after a thorough medical check-up, turned out to be benign or have no identifiable cause, therefore considered idiopathic.

    "Organised crime-themed video games have taken over the gaming charts, with titles such as \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Mafia: Definitive Edition\" leading the pack. This surge in popularity suggests a growing fascination among gamers for narratives that revolve around the underworld.\n\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\", developed by Rockstar Games, has consistently topped the charts since its release in 2013. The game, set in the fictional city of Los Santos, allows players to engage in a variety of criminal activities, from car theft to bank robberies. Its immersive storyline and open-world gameplay have made it a favourite among gamers worldwide.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Mafia: Definitive Edition\", a remake of the 2002 classic, has also seen a significant rise in sales. The game, developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K, takes players back to the Prohibition era, where they navigate the criminal underworld of the fictional city of Lost Heaven.\n\nThe success of these games is not just down to their engaging gameplay and high-quality graphics. The allure also lies in the narratives they offer, which often involve complex characters and moral dilemmas. These games provide players with an opportunity to explore a darker side of life, albeit in a virtual setting.\n\nHowever, the dominance of gangster-themed games in the charts has also sparked concerns among some critics. They argue that these games may glorify violence and criminal behaviour, potentially influencing impressionable young players. \n\nIn response, game developers and industry experts have highlighted the age ratings and parental controls available in these games. They also point out that video games, like movies and books, are a form of entertainment and storytelling, and should not be held solely responsible for influencing behaviour.\n\nDespite the controversy, the popularity of gangster-themed games shows no signs of waning. As technology continues to advance, gamers can expect even more immersive and complex narratives from the underworld in the future.",
    "I'm not sure if this is the right sub to ask but I'm searching advice. I'm not from the US and currently living and studying in Sweden. I've been depressed and anxious since I was 15 (11 years ago… I'm 26 now), and I found BPD symptoms I have according to the criteria. I've been diagnosed with BDD and some depression… but I'm not sure if I have something else. My first visit to the mental care clinic in Sweden (in 2015) I was diagnosed with \"depressive illness\" and prescribed antidepressants. I took them for 2 or 3 months and went to the psychiatrist and they recommended a psychologist, saying that there was nothing else they could do as there was no disorder for them to treat. So I didn't go back to that clinic.\nThe psychologist was very expensive but I didn't want to give up. He was talking to my GP and they agreed to give me medication that doesn't require a prescription here (trying to explain in simple terms :)). So I was given a prescription for those (I was soooo disappointed and felt betrayed). We did 1 month of therapy and everything was fine, I wasn't as depressed. But the anxiety was still there. Then we went to vacation because the psychologist was going travelling for another month. And in a couple of weeks I got back to the old me… full of insecurities and self hate. I was desperate, felt like I would never get better. That my therapist didn't help me despite him costing me a ton of money, so I stopped going to him.\nWell, I went to the mental health clinic the next year (this was August 2017), but the therapist I got didn't help me at all. Again, after I felt they couldn't really do anything else but recommend a psychologist… and yes, this time I didn't go to her because I already had one. I know I shouldn't have, but I felt she didn't help me a lot and what I needed was a psychiatrist.\nSo I felt I had to search for a private one and my GP recommended someone good. Finally. I contacted her and saw her for one session. In that last appointment with her she recommended me to join a self help group for anxiety and I still have that group to this day. Well, that group was and is very helpful and nice,",

    "A groundbreaking music story is set to hit the big screens as a film exploring the history of iconic British band Joy Division is slated to commence production. \n\nThe upcoming biopic will delve into the iconic rock band's rise to fame and their pioneering role within the post-punk music scene during the late 1970s. It will recount the journey of Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris, the members of Joy Division, whose innovative music profoundly influenced subsequent waves of alternative rock music. \n\nNo release date has been confirmed for the untitled project, but the film's creators promise a narrative that will resonate with both old and new fans alike. Filmmakers aim to both shed light on the band's personal experience and struggles behind the scenes and display their enduring impact on global music culture. \n\nThe upcoming movie will also spotlight a particular focus on frontman Ian Curtis, whose poetic songwriting and captivating performances shaped the band's distinctive sound. Curtis's tragic death, which highlighted the urgent issue of mental health within the music industry, will also serve as a critical narrative in the film.\n\nDetails regarding the project's director and cast are still under wraps at this stage, sparking numerous speculations among fans and industry insiders over possible picks. Given the complex and nuanced story that the production will tell, the casting decisions will undeniably be vital and keenly anticipated.\n\nThe film joins a long list of successful music biopics, including ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’, ‘Rocketman’, and ‘The Doors’, which have recently reflected audiences' appetite for exploring the layers behind their rock idols. \n\nJoy Division, whose influence continues to reverberate throughout rock, punk, and electronic music, have previously been depicted in other media. The 2007 film “Control”, directed by Anton Corbijn, offered a biographical depiction of Curtis's life and sadly premature death.\n\nHowever, the upcoming biopic promises a comprehensive portrayal of the entirety of Joy Division, encapsulating the collective experiences, reverberating influence, and riveting story behind one of the most seminal bands in music history.\n\nFans eagerly await further announcements, with the hope that the film can do justice to Joy Division's compelling and complex tale. The everlasting influence of Joy Division in the world of music remains unquestionable to this day, and a film documenting their unique journey provides a new opportunity to celebrate their legacy and introduce their story to a new generation of music enthusiasts.",

    "\"Return of the Jedi\" is the triumphant conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy that manages to tie up all loose ends while delivering an epic spectacle that is both visually stunning and emotionally satisfying. \n\nThe film's narrative is a masterclass in storytelling, with George Lucas expertly weaving together multiple plot threads to create a cohesive and engaging story. The character development is also commendable, with each character undergoing significant growth and change. Luke Skywalker's transformation from a naive farm boy to a wise and powerful Jedi Knight is particularly noteworthy. \n\nThe performances are top-notch, with Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher all delivering their best performances in the series. The supporting cast, including Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, and Peter Mayhew, also shine in their respective roles. \n\nThe special effects, even by today's standards, are impressive. The epic space battles, the thrilling speeder bike chase, and the climactic confrontation between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor are all visually stunning and expertly choreographed. John Williams' iconic score also adds a layer of emotional depth to the film, enhancing the overall viewing experience.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its flaws. The Ewoks, while cute and endearing, feel somewhat out of place in the grand scheme of things. Their role in the final battle against the Empire is also a bit hard to swallow. \n\nDespite these minor issues, \"Return of the Jedi\" is a fitting end to the original Star Wars trilogy. It is a film that is filled with heart, humor, and heroism, and it serves as a testament to the enduring appeal of the Star Wars universe. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the series, \"Return of the Jedi\" is a must-watch.",

    "AUSTRALIA'S petrol prices will remain frozen for another week as the government tries to keep up with surging demand and avoid a price war.\n\nPrime Minister Julia Gillard said on Monday that petrol would be $1.10 per litre in Sydney and $1.20 in Melbourne on Tuesday, after falling by more than 10 cents over the weekend.\n\nBut she warned motorists not to expect any relief until next month when the fuel excise rises to fund road projects.\n\nMs Gillard said the government was still trying to find an acceptable solution to the problem of rising fuel costs.\n\nShe said it had been difficult to get agreement among all parties but that there were some areas where they could work together.\n\n\"We are working very hard at this,\" Ms Gillard told reporters in Canberra.\n\n\"I think we have got a good deal on the table.\"\n\nThe prime minister said the government's plan to increase the fuel excise by 1.5 cents per litre - which takes effect on July 1 - was designed to help pay for new roads and other infrastructure.\n\nIt also meant that the cost of filling up your car would rise by about $2.50 a day.\n\n\"That means that if you fill up today, you'll pay $3.40 tomorrow,\" Ms Gillard said.\n\n\"So I'm hoping that people understand that this is a temporary measure.\"\n\nHowever, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has accused the government of being out of touch with ordinary Australians who were paying more for their petrol.\n\nHe said the government should instead focus on cutting spending and raising taxes.\n\n\"This is just another example of how the Labor Party is out of touch with everyday Australians,\" he said.\n\n\"They're talking about increasing the tax burden on families and small businesses while they're actually cutting back on education, health and welfare.\"\n\nMr Abbott said the government should cut its own budget deficit rather than raise taxes.\n\n\"If the Prime Minister wants to talk about fairness, then why doesn't she start by cutting her own budget deficit?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why don't she start by cutting her own waste?

    "Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has reignited hopes of a better performance as the Premier League resumes.\n\nSpeaking during a press conference, Solskjaer sounded upbeat about United's chances this season. \"We've had a good break, it's given us a chance to reset and focus on what's important. I am optimistic about the fixtures ahead,\" said the Norwegian.\n\nManchester United has been under immense pressure following a string of poor performances this season. However, Solskjaer believes the club can still salvage their season, stating that he and his team are \"ready to give it their all\".\n\nSolskjaer has praised the club's players, especially the youth, who he believes are putting in extra effort and proving their worth. \"The young players have shown great potential, they have the energy and work rate we need. It is exciting to see what they will bring to the team in the coming matches,\" stated Solskjaer.\n\nSome fans had voiced concerns over Solskjaer's leadership following the club's dismal performance this year. But the Norwegian has appeared to regain their confidence with his current commitment, work ethic and the sense of determination he showed not only in training the players but also on the strategy front.\n\nSolskjaer's optimism comes at a crucial time when Manchester United sits in the middle of the Premier League table. With tough fixtures ahead including heavyweights Manchester City and Liverpool, the Norwegian's positivity offers much needed morale boost to the team and the supporters alike.\n\nSolskjaer, who is highly respected for his playing career at United where he scored 126 goals in 366 appearances, has been managing the club since December 2018. His tenure has seen varied success, with some spectacular wins but also disappointing losses.\n\nSupporters will be hoping that their manager's renewed hope is not misplaced, and that the remainder of the season will bring an upturn in United's fortunes.\n\nWhile only time will tell if Solskjaer's optimism will yield positive results on the pitch, his renewed commitment towards the club is definitely a step in the right direction, lifting spirits among his team and fans. As the Premier League resumes, Solskjaer and his men will take on every game with a fight that, they hope, may end in glorious victory.",

In another example circulated on social media, there was a photo of two women in matching yellow Nazi uniforms alongside the message: \"only in Britain\" – apparently suggesting they were in attendance at something rather than just enjoying themselves.

The story is somewhat predictable, but there are still some surprises along the way, and there is a satisfying emotional payoff at the end.

    "Software-Defined Constrained Optimization (SDOCP) is an emerging field in which software engineers are able to design and implement algorithms that can be used to optimize routing protocols, such as Ethernet or IP. The goal of this work is to develop a new algorithm for optimizing SCOR on top of the existing SCOR protocol. We present a novel approach based on a combination of two techniques: (i) a probabilistic programming framework and (ii) a dynamic programming language. Our method allows us to define a set of constraints that describe how we want our network to behave, and then use these constraints to generate optimal solutions. This approach has several advantages over traditional approaches, including its ability to leverage the power of modern computer hardware. In particular, it enables us to efficiently compute the optimal solution even when the number of nodes in the network grows exponentially with time.",
    "I'm not going to lie, I was pretty disappointed when I saw that my favorite subreddit had been banned. It's one of my favorites because it has always been a place where people can come together and talk about whatever they want without fear of being shamed or censored for their opinions. But I guess we all know how Reddit works. The admins have decided to ban subreddits based on what they think will get them more traffic. This is just another example of censorship at its finest.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Reddit has banned something that it didn't like. In fact, it's happened several times in the past. For instance, back in 2011, Reddit banned a subreddit called \"Fat People Hate.\" That subreddit was created by user /u/fatpeoplehate, who was then banned by Reddit.\n\nIn 2012, Reddit banned a subreddit called \"Creepshots,\" which featured photos of women taken without their consent. Creepshots was created by user /u/creepyPMs. He was also banned by Reddit.\n\nAnd last year, Reddit banned a subreddit called \"Jailbait.\" Jailbait was created by user /u/jailbait_chad. He was also banned by Reddit.\n\nSo why did Reddit ban r/CoonTown? Well, according to the moderators of r/CoonTown, it wasn't because of any specific rule violation. Instead, they say that the reason behind the banning was because of the content of the subreddit itself.\n\nHere are some excerpts from an email sent to me by one of the moderators of r/CoonTown:\n\nWe were banned because we posted pictures of black men having sex with white women. We don't condone rape, but we do support consensual non-consent between two adults of any race. We're not racist, we're not bigots, we're not misogynists, we're not anything other than normal human beings. And we've never advocated violence against anyone. We simply wanted to share images of black men having sex with white women.\n\nIt seems as though the admins of Reddit really hate free speech. They seem to be afraid that if they allow certain types of content on their site, then they'll lose out on potential revenue. So instead of allowing users to express themselves freely, they decide to censor everything.\n\nWhat do you guys",

    "We present fast graph-cut based optimization (GCBO) for dense deformable registration of volume images, which can be used to reduce the number of image transformations and improve the quality of the resulting registration. GCBO uses a simple algorithm that combines several different techniques to minimize the number of image transformations needed to reconstruct an object's shape. We show that GCBO improves both the accuracy and speed of the reconstruction process compared with other methods. Our results demonstrate that GCBO can significantly improve the quality of the final registration by reducing the number of image transformations required to reconstruct the object's shape.",

We’ve witnessed an increasing disregard for international law, with war crimes and human rights abuses being committed with alarming regularity and usually, with complete impunity,\" Naidoo stated.\n\nHe went on to express his disappointment with certain permanent UN Security Council members who have failed to utilise their power and influence to prevent and resolve ongoing conflicts, further exacerbating the situations. \n\nHe said, \"These so-called superpowers are supposed to uphold the highest commitment to peace and humanity, yet they are often the ones wielding their vetoes against resolutions meant to prevent mass atrocities.\"\n\nAmnesty International, under Naidoo's leadership, continues to champion the rights of those most vulnerable and stands firm against abuse and injustice. The non-profit is advocating for more responsible, ethical leadership and policies that are grounded in a commitment to human rights and peace.\n\nNaidoo also urged nations to recommit themselves to the principles outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a historic document that sets out the essential rights and freedoms to which every individual is entitled.\n\nAt the conclusion of his statement, Naidoo implored, \"In the midst of destructive conflicts and a global humanitarian crisis, it's time for world leaders to step up and take responsibility. We need more than just words; we need decisive action.\"\n\nThis heartrending plea for global action underscores Amnesty's ongoing campaign to galvanise the international community in a shared commitment to peace, justice, and humanitarianism.

A spotlight is being shone on aids and climate change, two crises the planet continues to battle amidst other calamities.\n\nVarious non-profit organizations have voiced their rising concerns over the AIDS pandemic, stressing that the issue remains globally underestimated. UNAIDS estimates that currently there are 38 million people worldwide living with AIDS, with around 1.7 million newly infected in 2019.\n\n\"Despite advancements we have made in containing the disease, we can't let our guards down,\" said Peter Piot, a Belgian microbiologist who co-discovered the Ebola virus. \"Aids still continues to claim millions of lives each year and pull down economies in countries most affected. Here at Davos, we hope to inject renewed vigour in tackling AIDS by calling for more funding, fostering research and encouraging public participation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, climate change is another issue generating much discussion. Davos has long been a platform to discuss global warming and its impact, but this year's agenda spotlights climate change more than any other in its past. \n\nPressure has been building for concrete actions to be taken; with high profile activists such as Greta Thunberg leading the climate strikes worldwide, climate has become a focal point. Experts will deliberate strategies to curb rising global temperatures and discuss the implementation of more sustainable practices in various industries.\n\n“As always, the World Economic Forum provides an unparalleled platform for leaders from the public and private sectors to come together and address these pressing matters,” said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. \n\nSchwab added, \"It's time for world leaders to wake up to the reality of these crises and work collectively towards mitigating them.

    "In this article we show how to ensure that parallel computations achieve their goal: they are evaluated serially on the same datapoints, and their results are evaluated at the same point in time. Although a parallel implementation may be possible in some cases; in reality a parallel implementation usually requires the addition of some overhead. In this article we present the design and details about a new optimizer, which ensures that parallel computation always is uniform across datasets. This optimizer is based on the concept of Uniform Sparsity, which ensures that a set of parallel computations have the same distribution of their results. We show how to implement this optimizer in the language of Haskell, a language which, apart from its powerful type system, boasts some of the most efficient and robust parallel execution models to date. The optimizer is called \"Tortoise\", for obvious reasons.\n(A side story: one of the early authors of this paper was also a programmer who wrote the serializer for various.NET serializers – this lead to a meeting in which it was decided to name it \"Tortoise\".)\nIn the paper \"Sparsity and Parallel Acquisition: Optimal Uniform and Nonuniform Acceleration\" [pdf] it was found that uniformization is an essential requirement for many algorithms. In fact, linear algebraic and other such parallel algorithms require uniform parallel processing.\nWhile uniform parallelization leads to great performance, it has a negative impact on certain algorithms. On the other hand, uniform computation, by its very nature, produces a monotonic distribution of results, which results in lower latency – both for code reading and code writing. This fact is well documented, however, and in many cases we will see that the loss in performance is insignificant in many cases. This was the case for the fast algorithms in the paper. However, some slow algorithms were shown to benefit from uniformization. For example, the algorithm to split a list into two sorted lists, has a uniform time step in its parallel computation. But in practice this is not the case, and the parallel algorithm will not always achieve uniform time step on each invocation.

    "We propose an unsupervised learning method to learn shape representation directly based only sparse point clouds, which can be used in various applications such as 3D reconstruction and volumetric image segmentation (VIS). The proposed approach consists two steps; first we train our model with synthetic data generated by sampling points uniformly over shapes' surfaces using Poisson disk distribution [1]. Then at test time when given real-world input images containing objects that are not present during training phase but have similar geometry or topology compared those seen before then it will automatically adapt itself without any supervision signal provided explicitly through labels like class names etc., thus making this system more robust against unseen classes while still being able perform well enough even though there might exist some differences between them due their inherent nature e g different textures colors sizes scales orientations poses rotations angles speeds velocities accelerations decelerating rates acceleration profiles braking patterns stopping distances reaction times response curves trajectories paths routes tracks courses directions destinations goals targets objectives purposes intentions outcomes effects consequences results impacts causes origins sources beginnings endings ends finishes terminations conclusions resolutions solutions answers questions responses explanations clarifications interpretations understandings insights discoveries findings revelations breakthroughs inventions creations developments innovations advancements improvements enhancements upgrades modifications alterations adjustments augmentatons additions deletions subtractions removals replacements substitutions variations deviations departures digressions diversions detours excursuses side trips sidelines sidetracks meander wander deviate stray diverge swerve veer drift roam ramble range prowl stroll saunter amble perambulate promenade strut parade march tramp traipse walk trot jog run sprint gallop scamper scurry dash race fly zoom rocket speed rush tear streak shoot zip whiz whoosh hurtle careening skid slide spin whirl twirl rotate revolve orbit circle gyrate turn twist roll tumble flip flutter flap vibrate quiver jiggle shake shimmy wag wigw ag tremor pulsate throb palpitate beat thump pound hammer knock rap tap clap slap bang rattle drum buzz hum drone roar rum bleep croak chirp tweet squeal squawk caw crow screech hissing purr growl grunt moo oink bellow bray neigh snort baa lowing bark howling yowl moan whimpering sobbing weeping crying shrieking screaming yelling shouting holler hollaring caterwauling ululating warbling whistlesong",
    "Guten Tag alle,\n\nich möchte gern für eine offene Diskussion stellen. In letzter Zeit habe ich festgestellt, dass mit zunehmender Frustration und Unsicherheit über die aktuelle Koronapolitik viele Menschen gerne in der sogenannten \"Querdenker\"-Bewegung landen. Das Problem dabei ist allerdings, dass viele Menschen sich von dieser Bewegung distanzieren, weil sie oft mit Verschwörungstheorien und radikalen Meinungen assoziiert wird.\n\nAber gibt es andere Gruppierungen oder Bewegungen, die auch kritische Fragen zur C-Politik stellen, jedoch ohne diese radikale Denkansatz? Eine Bewegung, die eine gesunde Diskussion, transparente Regierungsentscheidungen zu Corona und möglicherweise auch die Überprüfung von Einschränkungen fordert, ohne dabei in Extremismus und \"Aluhut\"-Praktiken zu verfallen?\n\nIch denke, es ist wichtig, in Zeiten wie diesen unsere Ängste und Bedenken auszudrücken, ohne dabei die Wissenschaft oder die Realität zu leugnen. Bitte teilt eure Gedanken und eventuell auch Organisationen, wenn ihr welche kennt.\n\nVielen Dank!",
    "We present an approach to learn aerial image segmentation models directly on online maps, without requiring any manual annotations or ground truth data at all! Our method uses only unlabeled images and their corresponding map labels as input; it then learns how best segment each pixel in these inputs based solely upon its location within them (i e., using spatial context). We show that this simple idea can be used effectively with modern deep learning architectures such Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) which have been shown previously not work well when trained purely through supervised methods due mainly because they require large amounts labeled training examples while also being computationally expensive during inference time since there are many parameters involved making optimization difficult even if we had access those datasets beforehand anyway so why bother trying? This problem becomes especially acute given recent advances made by researchers working towards developing autonomous vehicles capable driving themselves around cities streets safely enough avoid collisions pedestrians cyclists etcetera – something no human could ever hope achieve alone let's face facts here folks…we're just too slow sometimes 😉.) In addition our system requires minimal computational resources compared other approaches like fully convolution networks FCN-8/16 [1] where one would need hundreds thousands GPU hours train model before seeing results worth mentioning but instead ours takes less than 1 hour total compute power across multiple machines running parallelized code simultaneously -which means anyone who wants try out new ideas doesn't necessarily always depend heavily specialized hardware anymore either way though I think most people will agree once you've seen what kind things become possible thanks advancements machine intelligence nowadays 🙂",

    "This is an excellent film, and I'm not just saying that because it's my favorite movie of all time. The story is simple enough to be understood by anyone who has seen the original, but the characters are so well-developed that you can't help but feel like you're in their shoes. It's a great comedy with some very dark moments, and if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it now!\n\nI've been watching this movie since its release in 1998, and I still find myself laughing out loud at every joke. This is one of those movies where you'll laugh until your eyes hurt, and then you'll cry when you realize how much you laughed. If you don't have any idea what I mean by that, then you should probably stop reading right here and go watch the movie immediately.\n\nIf you want to know more about the plot, then read on…\n\nThe Big Lebowski is based on the novel of the same name written by John Turturro (who also wrote the screenplay). The book follows the adventures of Walter Sobchak, a man who lives in a small town called Colorado City, Arizona. He works as a barber, and he loves his job. However, he doesn't love his life, and he spends most of his days thinking about his girlfriend, Janey Slater. One day, while working at the barbershop, he meets a woman named Shelly, who introduces him to her boyfriend, Jeff Bridges. They become friends, and they spend most of their free time together.\n\nOne night, after a long day of work, Walter decides to take a walk around town. While walking down the street, he sees a sign advertising a bowling alley. He goes inside and orders a drink, which turns out to be a beer. After drinking the beer, he notices that there is no bartender. He asks the bartender if she needs anything, and she tells him that she does not need anything. Walter leaves the bar, and walks back home. When he gets home, he finds that his wife has left him. He tries to get angry at her, but he realizes that he cannot. Instead, he decides to make a deal with God. He will give up his soul to God if he can get rid of his wife.\n\nWalter makes a deal with God",

    "Face recognition is a challenging problem in computer vision. The problem is to find a face in a large image, given a set of features. The problem is particularly difficult for images with a large number of faces, such as those in the Internet.
