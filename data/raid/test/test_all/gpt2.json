    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",

    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training.

    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges.

    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",
    "Mining and learning the shape variability of underlying population has\nbenefited the applications including parametric shape modeling, 3D animation,\nand image segmentation.

This paper\nformulates the pose learning problem as mixtures of factor analyzers. The\nsegmentation is obtained by components posterior probabilities and the\nrotations in pose variations are learned by the factor loading matrices. To\nguarantee that the factor loading matrices are composed by rotation matrices,\nconstraints are imposed and the corresponding closed form optimal solution is\nderived.

    "  Timed systems, such as timed automata, are usually analyzed using their\noperational semantics on timed words.

The main idea is to consider timed behaviors as graphs\nwith matching edges capturing timing constraints. When a family of graphs has\nbounded tree-width, they can be interpreted in trees and MSO-definable\nproperties of such graphs can be checked using tree automata. The technique is\nquite general and applies to many timed systems. In this paper, as an example,\nwe develop the technique on timed pushdown systems, which have recently\nreceived considerable attention. Further, we also demonstrate how we can use it\non timed automata and timed multi-stack pushdown systems (with boundedness\nrestrictions).\n",

A weakness of this approach is that different drivers\npossess vastly different densities at which traffic flow stagnates. This\ndrawback can be overcome by modifying the pressure relation in the ARZ model,\nleading to the generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang (GARZ) model.

The novelty of this model is that the\nUniverse includes both cases curvature and torsion, and one dominated by a\nChaplygin gas. In order to calculate cosmological solutions, we obtained\nFriedmann equations and also equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy.\nBy employing interacting model we considered the total energy density and the\ntotal pressure of Universe as the combination of components of dark energy and\nChaplygin gas.

    "Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) techniques based on Super Resolution\nConvolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) are applied to micro-computed tomography\n({\\mu}CT) images of sandstone and carbonate rocks. Digital rock imaging is\nlimited by the capability of the scanning device resulting in trade-offs\nbetween resolution and field of view, and super resolution methods tested in\nthis study aim to compensate for these limits. SRCNN models SR-Resnet, Enhanced\nDeep SR (EDSR), and Wide-Activation Deep SR (WDSR) are used on the Digital Rock\nSuper Resolution 1 (DRSRD1) Dataset of 4x downsampled images, comprising of\n2000 high resolution (800x800) raw micro-CT images of Bentheimer sandstone and\nEstaillades carbonate. The trained models are applied to the validation and\ntest data within the dataset and show a 3-5 dB rise in image quality compared\nto bicubic interpolation, with all tested models performing within a 0.1 dB\nrange. Difference maps indicate that edge sharpness is completely recovered in\nimages within the scope of the trained model, with only high frequency noise\nrelated detail loss. We find that aside from generation of high-resolution\nimages, a beneficial side effect of super resolution methods applied to\nsynthetically downgraded images is the removal of image noise while recovering\nedgewise sharpness which is beneficial for the segmentation process. The model\nis also tested against real low-resolution images of Bentheimer rock with image\naugmentation to account for natural noise and blur. The SRCNN method is shown\nto act as a preconditioner for image segmentation under these circumstances\nwhich naturally leads to further future development and training of models that\nsegment an image directly.

    "The development of high quality medical image segmentation algorithms depends\non the availability of large datasets with pixel-level labels. The challenges\nof collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to\ndevelop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to\nobtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their\ncorresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice\nnon-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that\nuse 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image\nsegmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the\nassumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new\nbounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of\npixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight\nbounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by\nevaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the\nproposed bounding box correction algorithm. When the tightness is improved by\nour solution, the results of the weakly-supervised segmentation become much\ncloser to those of the fully-supervised one.",
    "This paper presents a novel unsupervised segmentation method for 3D medical\nimages. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant advances\nin image segmentation. However, most of the recent methods rely on supervised\nlearning, which requires large amounts of manually annotated data. Thus, it is\nchallenging for these methods to cope with the growing amount of medical\nimages. This paper proposes a unified approach to unsupervised deep\nrepresentation learning and clustering for segmentation. Our proposed method\nconsists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn deep feature\nrepresentations of training patches from a target image using joint\nunsupervised learning (JULE) that alternately clusters representations\ngenerated by a CNN and updates the CNN parameters using cluster labels as\nsupervisory signals. We extend JULE to 3D medical images by utilizing 3D\nconvolutions throughout the CNN architecture. In the second phase, we apply\nk-means to the deep representations from the trained CNN and then project\ncluster labels to the target image in order to obtain the fully segmented\nimage. We evaluated our methods on three images of lung cancer specimens\nscanned with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The automatic segmentation\nof pathological regions in micro-CT could further contribute to the\npathological examination process.

    "  We study the impact of electrode band structure on transport through\nsingle-molecule junctions by measuring the conductance of pyridine-based\nmolecules using Ag and Au electrodes. Our experiments are carried out using the\nscanning tunneling microscope based break-junction technique and are supported\nby density functional theory based calculations. We find from both experiments\nand calculations that the coupling of the dominant transport orbital to the\nmetal is stronger for Au-based junctions when compared with Ag-based junctions.\nWe attribute this difference to relativistic effects, which results in an\nenhanced density of d-states at the Fermi energy for Au compared with Ag. We\nfurther show that the alignment of the conducting orbital relative to the Fermi\nlevel does not follow the work function difference between two metals and is\ndifferent for conjugated and saturated systems. We thus demonstrate that the\ndetails of the molecular level alignment and electronic coupling in\nmetal-organic interfaces do not follow simple rules, but are rather the\nconsequence of subtle local interactions.\n",
    "  Many practical sensing applications involve multiple sensors simultaneously\nacquiring measurements of a single object. Conversely, most existing sparse\nrecovery guarantees in compressed sensing concern only single-sensor\nacquisition scenarios. In this paper, we address the optimal recovery of\ncompressible signals from multi-sensor measurements using compressed sensing\ntechniques, thereby confirming the benefits of multi- over single-sensor\nenvironments. Throughout the paper, we consider a broad class of sensing\nmatrices, and two fundamentally different sampling scenarios (distinct and\nidentical respectively), both of which are relevant to applications. For the\ncase of diagonal sensor profile matrices (which characterize environmental\nconditions between a source and the sensors), this paper presents two key\nimprovements over existing results. First, a simpler optimal recovery guarantee\nfor distinct sampling, and second, an improved recovery guarantee for identical\nsampling, based on the so-called sparsity in levels signal model.\n",
    "This paper proposes the first, known to us, open source presentation attack\ndetection (PAD) solution to distinguish between authentic iris images (possibly\nwearing clear contact lenses) and irises with textured contact lenses.

The\nsoftware is written in C++ and Python and uses only open source resources, such\nas OpenCV. This method does not incorporate iris image segmentation, which may\nbe problematic for unknown fake samples. Instead, it makes a best guess to\nlocalize the rough position of the iris.

    "  Analyzing the exchange energy of two conduction electrons in a crystal we\nfind that the exchange energy may be negative and, thus, a singlet state may be\nfavorable. A full overlap in real space of wave functions of two conduction\nelectrons leads to a deeper exchange energy. Thus, the exchange interaction\ncauses a bond between two conduction electrons in real space. The singlet bond\nis possible because the singlet electrons can simultaneously and permanently\noccupy one spatial ground state, so the average energy of paired electrons is\nlower than the energy of unpaired electrons. Thus, the pairing is a result of\nthe Pauli Exclusion Principle. If conduction electrons, before pairing, are put\non the Fermi surface in the momentum space, then every pair may exist\npermanently in time. The motion of conduction electrons in the crystal may\nprevent the formation of Cooper pairs, because the kinetic energy of the motion\nis usually larger than the binding energy in the pair. Conduction electrons as\nstanding waves are local and have zero momenta, hence their momenta are\nsynchronous; therefore, weak singlet bonds are stable despite the large kinetic\nenergy on the Fermi surface. The local pairing of standing waves explains the\ninverse isotope effect, Tc-dome, insulator-superconductor transitions and many\nother facts about superconductors. The electron pairs, as bosons, can form a\nmacroscopically coherent Bose-Einstein-Condensate and, thus, become\nnon-dissipative and non-local.\n",

    "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly important due to their\nexcellent empirical performance on a wide range of problems. However,\nregularization is generally achieved by indirect means, largely due to the\ncomplex set of functions defined by a network and the difficulty in measuring\nfunction complexity. There exists no method in the literature for additive\nregularization based on a norm of the function, as is classically considered in\nstatistical learning theory. In this work, we propose sampling-based\napproximations to weighted function norms as regularizers for deep neural\nnetworks. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first proof in the\nliterature of the NP-hardness of computing function norms of DNNs, motivating\nthe necessity of an approximate approach. We then derive a generalization bound\nfor functions trained with weighted norms and prove that a natural stochastic\noptimization strategy minimizes the bound. Finally, we empirically validate the\nimproved performance of the proposed regularization strategies for both convex\nfunction sets as well as DNNs on real-world classification and image\nsegmentation tasks demonstrating improved performance over weight decay,\ndropout, and batch normalization.

    "  We propose and demonstrate localized mode coupling as a viable dispersion\nengineering technique for phase-matched resonant four-wave mixing (FWM). We\ndemonstrate a dual-cavity resonant structure that employs coupling-induced\nfrequency splitting at one of three resonances to compensate for cavity\ndispersion, enabling phase-matching. Coupling strength is controlled by thermal\ntuning of one cavity enabling active control of the resonant\nfrequency-matching. In a fabricated silicon microresonator, we show an 8 dB\nenhancement of seeded FWM efficiency over the non-compensated state. The\nmeasured four-wave mixing has a peak wavelength conversion efficiency of -37.9\ndB across a free spectral range (FSR) of 3.334 THz ($\\sim$27 nm). Enabled by\nstrong counteraction of dispersion, this FSR is, to our knowledge, the largest\nin silicon to demonstrate FWM to date. This form of mode-coupling-based, active\ndispersion compensation can be beneficial for many FWM-based devices including\nwavelength converters, parametric amplifiers, and widely detuned correlated\nphoton-pair sources. Apart from compensating intrinsic dispersion, the proposed\nmechanism can alternatively be utilized in an otherwise dispersionless\nresonator to counteract the detuning effect of self- and cross-phase modulation\non the pump resonance during FWM, thereby addressing a fundamental issue in the\nperformance of light sources such as broadband optical frequency combs.\n",

    "The random walker (RW) algorithm is used for both image segmentation and\nregistration, and possesses several useful properties that make it popular in\nmedical imaging, such as being globally optimizable, allowing user interaction,\nand providing uncertainty information. The RW algorithm defines a weighted\ngraph over an image and uses the graph's Laplacian matrix to regularize its\nsolutions. This regularization reduces to solving a large system of equations,\nwhich may be excessively time consuming in some applications, such as when\ninteracting with a human user. Techniques have been developed that precompute\neigenvectors of a Laplacian offline, after image acquisition but before any\nanalysis, in order speed up the RW algorithm online, when segmentation or\nregistration is being performed. However, precomputation requires certain\nalgorithm parameters be fixed offline, limiting their flexibility. In this\npaper, we develop techniques to update the precomputed data online when RW\nparameters are altered. Specifically, we dynamically determine the number of\neigenvectors needed for a desired accuracy based on user input, and derive\nupdate equations for the eigenvectors when the edge weights or topology of the\nimage graph are changed.

    "The main obstacle to weakly supervised semantic image segmentation is the\ndifficulty of obtaining pixel-level information from coarse image-level\nannotations.

    "Uncertainty estimation is important for interpreting the trustworthiness of\nmachine learning models in many applications. This is especially critical in\nthe data-driven active learning setting where the goal is to achieve a certain\naccuracy with minimum labeling effort. In such settings, the model learns to\nselect the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation based on its\nestimated uncertainty. The highly uncertain predictions are assumed to be more\ninformative for improving model performance. In this paper, we explore\nuncertainty calibration within an active learning framework for medical image\nsegmentation, an area where labels often are scarce. Various uncertainty\nestimation methods and acquisition strategies (regions and full images) are\ninvestigated. We observe that selecting regions to annotate instead of full\nimages leads to more well-calibrated models. Additionally, we experimentally\nshow that annotating regions can cut 50% of pixels that need to be labeled by\nhumans compared to annotating full images.",
    "  This paper presents a new Bayesian collaborative sparse regression method for\nlinear unmixing of hyperspectral images. Our contribution is twofold; first, we\npropose a new Bayesian model for structured sparse regression in which the\nsupports of the sparse abundance vectors are a priori spatially correlated\nacross pixels (i.e., materials are spatially organised rather than randomly\ndistributed at a pixel level). This prior information is encoded in the model\nthrough a truncated multivariate Ising Markov random field, which also takes\ninto consideration the facts that pixels cannot be empty (i.e, there is at\nleast one material present in each pixel), and that different materials may\nexhibit different degrees of spatial regularity. Secondly, we propose an\nadvanced Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the posterior\nprobabilities that materials are present or absent in each pixel, and,\nconditionally to the maximum marginal a posteriori configuration of the\nsupport, compute the MMSE estimates of the abundance vectors. A remarkable\nproperty of this algorithm is that it self-adjusts the values of the parameters\nof the Markov random field, thus relieving practitioners from setting\nregularisation parameters by cross-validation. The performance of the proposed\nmethodology is finally demonstrated through a series of experiments with\nsynthetic and real data and comparisons with other algorithms from the\nliterature.\n",
    "Superpixel segmentation has become an important research problem in image\nprocessing. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Spanning Forest (ISF)\nframework, based on sequences of Image Foresting Transforms, where one can\nchoose i) a seed sampling strategy, ii) a connectivity function, iii) an\nadjacency relation, and iv) a seed pixel recomputation procedure to generate\nimproved sets of connected superpixels (supervoxels in 3D) per iteration. The\nsuperpixels in ISF structurally correspond to spanning trees rooted at those\nseeds. We present five ISF methods to illustrate different choices of its\ncomponents. These methods are compared with approaches from the\nstate-of-the-art in effectiveness and efficiency. The experiments involve 2D\nand 3D datasets with distinct characteristics, and a high level application,\nnamed sky image segmentation.

    "It is important to find the target as soon as possible for search and rescue\noperations. Surveillance camera systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are\nused to support search and rescue. Automatic object detection is important\nbecause a person cannot monitor multiple surveillance screens simultaneously\nfor 24 hours. Also, the object is often too small to be recognized by the human\neye on the surveillance screen. This study used UAVs around the Port of Houston\nand fixed surveillance cameras to build an automatic target detection system\nthat supports the US Coast Guard (USCG) to help find targets (e.g., person\noverboard). We combined image segmentation, enhancement, and convolution neural\nnetworks to reduce detection time to detect small targets.

The wind flow is modeled by a\nmulti-mesh (cut finite element) method. This allows each building to be\nembedded in a boundary-fitted mesh which can be moved freely on top of a fixed\nbackground mesh. This approach enables a multitude of settlement layouts to be\nevaluated without the need for costly mesh generation when changing the\nconfiguration of buildings.

    "In photography, low depth of field (DOF) is an important technique to\nemphasize the object of interest (OOI) within an image. Thus, low DOF images\nare widely used in the application area of macro, portrait or sports\nphotography. When viewing a low DOF image, the viewer implicitly concentrates\non the regions that are sharper regions of the image and thus segments the\nimage into regions of interest and non regions of interest which has a major\nimpact on the perception of the image. Thus, a robust algorithm for the fully\nautomatic detection of the OOI in low DOF images provides valuable information\nfor subsequent image processing and image retrieval.

    "  We consider the Longest Queue Drop memory management policy in shared-memory\nswitches consisting of $N$ output ports. The shared memory of size $M\\geq N$\nmay have an arbitrary number of input ports. Each packet may be admitted by any\nincoming port, but must be destined to a specific output port and each output\nport may be used by only one queue. The Longest Queue Drop policy is a natural\nonline strategy used in directing the packet flow in buffering problems.\nAccording to this policy and assuming unit packet values and cost of\ntransmission, every incoming packet is accepted, whereas if the shared memory\nbecomes full, one or more packets belonging to the longest queue are preempted,\nin order to make space for the newly arrived packets. It was proved in 2001\n[Hahne et al., SPAA '01] that the Longest Queue Drop policy is 2-competitive\nand at least $\\sqrt{2}$-competitive.

    "We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network\narchitecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core\ntrainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding\ndecoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture\nof the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional\nlayers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low\nresolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for\npixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which\nthe decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically,\nthe decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the\ncorresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the\nneed for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then\nconvolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our\nproposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN and also with the well known\nDeepLab-LargeFOV, DeconvNet architectures. This comparison reveals the memory\nversus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance.\n  SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it\nis designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time\nduring inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable\nparameters than other competing architectures.

    "Methods that move towards less supervised scenarios are key for image\nsegmentation, as dense labels demand significant human intervention.

Egg images are segmented\nusing the K-means algorithm based on Lab color images. The results of the\nimages acquisition are converted into Lab color space images. The results of\nLab color space images are processed using K-means for each color. The K-means\nprocess uses cluster k=3, where this cluster divided the image into three\nparts, namely background, eggs, and yolk eggs. Yolk eggs are part of eggs that\nhave embryonic characteristics. This study applies the concept of color in the\ninitial segmentation and grayscale in the final stages.

    "Image segmentation is a fundamental research topic in image processing and\ncomputer vision. In the last decades, researchers developed a large number of\nsegmentation algorithms for various applications. Amongst these algorithms, the\nNormalized cut (Ncut) segmentation method is widely applied due to its good\nperformance. The Ncut segmentation model is an optimization problem whose\nenergy is defined on a specifically designed graph. Thus, the segmentation\nresults of the existing Ncut method are largely dependent on a pre-constructed\nsimilarity measure on the graph since this measure is usually given empirically\nby users. This flaw will lead to some undesirable segmentation results. In this\npaper, we propose a Ncut-based segmentation algorithm by integrating an\nadaptive similarity measure and spatial regularization. The proposed model\ncombines the Parzen-Rosenblatt window method, non-local weights entropy, Ncut\nenergy, and regularizer of phase field in a variational framework. Our method\ncan adaptively update the similarity measure function by estimating some\nparameters. This adaptive procedure enables the proposed algorithm finding a\nbetter similarity measure for classification than the Ncut method. We provide\nsome mathematical interpretation of the proposed adaptive similarity from\nmulti-viewpoints such as statistics and convex optimization. In addition, the\nregularizer of phase field can guarantee that the proposed algorithm has a\nrobust performance in the presence of noise, and it can also rectify the\nsimilarity measure with a spatial priori. The well-posed theory such as the\nexistence of the minimizer for the proposed model is given in the paper.\nCompared with some existing segmentation methods such as the traditional\nNcut-based model and the classical Chan-Vese model, the numerical experiments\nshow that our method can provide promising segmentation results.",
    "  Text data is often seen as \"take-away\" materials with little noise and easy\nto process information. Main questions are how to get data and transform them\ninto a good document format. But data can be sensitive to noise oftenly called\nambiguities. Ambiguities are aware from a long time, mainly because polysemy is\nobvious in language and context is required to remove uncertainty. I claim in\nthis paper that syntactic context is not suffisant to improve interpretation.\nIn this paper I try to explain that firstly noise can come from natural data\nthemselves, even involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified\nbut meaningless, can spoil content of a corpus; it may lead to contradictions\nand background noise.\n",
    "The task of image segmentation is inherently noisy due to ambiguities\nregarding the exact location of boundaries between anatomical structures. We\nargue that this information can be extracted from the expert annotations at no\nextra cost, and when integrated into state-of-the-art neural networks, it can\nlead to improved calibration between soft probabilistic predictions and the\nunderlying uncertainty. We built upon label smoothing (LS) where a network is\ntrained on 'blurred' versions of the ground truth labels which has been shown\nto be effective for calibrating output predictions. However, LS is not taking\nthe local structure into account and results in overly smoothed predictions\nwith low confidence even for non-ambiguous regions. Here, we propose Spatially\nVarying Label Smoothing (SVLS), a soft labeling technique that captures the\nstructural uncertainty in semantic segmentation. SVLS also naturally lends\nitself to incorporate inter-rater uncertainty when multiple labelmaps are\navailable. The proposed approach is extensively validated on four clinical\nsegmentation tasks with different imaging modalities, number of classes and\nsingle and multi-rater expert annotations. The results demonstrate that SVLS,\ndespite its simplicity, obtains superior boundary prediction with improved\nuncertainty and model calibration.",
    "Medical image segmentation is inherently an ambiguous task due to factors\nsuch as partial volumes and variations in anatomical definitions. While in most\ncases the segmentation uncertainty is around the border of structures of\ninterest, there can also be considerable inter-rater differences. The class of\nconditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) offers a principled approach to\ninferring distributions over plausible segmentations that are conditioned on\ninput images. Segmentation uncertainty estimated from samples of such\ndistributions can be more informative than using pixel level probability\nscores. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model that is\nbased on conditional Normalizing Flow (cFlow). The basic idea is to increase\nthe expressivity of the cVAE by introducing a cFlow transformation step after\nthe encoder. This yields improved approximations of the latent posterior\ndistribution, allowing the model to capture richer segmentation variations.\nWith this we show that the quality and diversity of samples obtained from our\nconditional generative model is enhanced. Performance of our model, which we\ncall cFlow Net, is evaluated on two medical imaging datasets demonstrating\nsubstantial improvements in both qualitative and quantitative measures when\ncompared to a recent cVAE based model.",
    "Currently, developments of deep learning techniques are providing\ninstrumental to identify, classify, and quantify patterns in medical images.\nSegmentation is one of the important applications in medical image analysis. In\nthis regard, U-Net is the predominant approach to medical image segmentation\ntasks. However, we found that those U-Net based models have limitations in\nseveral aspects, for example, millions of parameters in the U-Net consuming\nconsiderable computation resource and memory, lack of global information, and\nmissing some tough objects. Therefore, we applied two modifications to improve\nthe U-Net model: 1) designed and added the dilated channel-wise CNN module, 2)\nsimplified the U shape network. Based on these two modifications, we proposed a\nnovel light-weight architecture -- Channel-wise Feature Pyramid Network for\nMedicine (CFPNet-M). To evaluate our method, we selected five datasets with\ndifferent modalities: thermography, electron microscopy, endoscopy, dermoscopy,\nand digital retinal images. And we compared its performance with several models\nhaving different parameter scales. This paper also involves our previous\nstudies of DC-UNet and some commonly used light-weight neural networks. We\napplied the Tanimoto similarity instead of the Jaccard index for gray-level\nimage measurements. By comparison, CFPNet-M achieves comparable segmentation\nresults on all five medical datasets with only 0.65 million parameters, which\nis about 2% of U-Net, and 8.8 MB memory.

    "  In the current hyper-connected era, modern Information and Communication\nTechnology systems form sophisticated networks where not only do people\ninteract with other people, but also machines take an increasingly visible and\nparticipatory role. Such human-machine networks (HMNs) are embedded in the\ndaily lives of people, both for personal and professional use. They can have a\nsignificant impact by producing synergy and innovations. The challenge in\ndesigning successful HMNs is that they cannot be developed and implemented in\nthe same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, nor following a wholly\nhuman-centric view of the network. The problem requires an interdisciplinary\napproach. Here, we review current research of relevance to HMNs across many\ndisciplines. Extending the previous theoretical concepts of socio-technical\nsystems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social\nmachines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans\nand machines. We identify eight types of HMNs: public-resource computing,\ncrowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media,\nmultiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. We\nsystematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a\nfocus on implications for designing HMNs.

    "  In a k-linear triangulated category (where k is a field) we show that the\nexistence of Auslander-Reiten triangles implies that objects are determined, up\nto shift, by knowing dimensions of homomorphisms between them. In most cases\nthe objects themselves are distinguished by this information, a conclusion\nwhich was also reached under slightly different hypotheses in a theorem of\nJensen, Su and Zimmermann. The approach is to consider bilinear forms on\nGrothendieck groups which are analogous to the Green ring of a finite group.\n  We specialize to the category of perfect complexes for a self-injective\nalgebra, for which the Auslander-Reiten quiver has a known shape. We\ncharacterize the position in the quiver of many kinds of perfect complexes,\nincluding those of lengths 1, 2 and 3, rigid complexes and truncated projective\nresolutions. We describe completely the quiver components which contain\nprojective modules. We obtain relationships between the homology of complexes\nat different places in the quiver, deducing that every self-injective algebra\nof radical length at least 3 has indecomposable perfect complexes with\narbitrarily large homology in any given degree. We find also that homology\nstabilizes away from the rim of the quiver. We show that when the algebra is\nsymmetric, one of the forms considered earlier is Hermitian, and this allows us\nto compute its values knowing them only on objects on the rim of the quiver.\n",

    "Recent advances in deep learning based image segmentation methods have\nenabled real-time performance with human-level accuracy. However, occasionally\neven the best method fails due to low image quality, artifacts or unexpected\nbehaviour of black box algorithms. Being able to predict segmentation quality\nin the absence of ground truth is of paramount importance in clinical practice,\nbut also in large-scale studies to avoid the inclusion of invalid data in\nsubsequent analysis.\n  In this work, we propose two approaches of real-time automated quality\ncontrol for cardiovascular MR segmentations using deep learning.

    "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have had unprecedented success in medical\nimaging and, in particular, in medical image segmentation. However, despite the\nfact that segmentation results are closer than ever to the inter-expert\nvariability, CNNs are not immune to producing anatomically inaccurate\nsegmentations, even when built upon a shape prior. In this paper, we present a\nframework for producing cardiac image segmentation maps that are guaranteed to\nrespect pre-defined anatomical criteria, while remaining within the\ninter-expert variability. The idea behind our method is to use a well-trained\nCNN, have it process cardiac images, identify the anatomically implausible\nresults and warp these results toward the closest anatomically valid cardiac\nshape. This warping procedure is carried out with a constrained variational\nautoencoder (cVAE) trained to learn a representation of valid cardiac shapes\nthrough a smooth, yet constrained, latent space. With this cVAE, we can project\nany implausible shape into the cardiac latent space and steer it toward the\nclosest correct shape. We tested our framework on short-axis MRI as well as\napical two and four-chamber view ultrasound images, two modalities for which\ncardiac shapes are drastically different.

    "Compared to the general semantic segmentation problem, portrait segmentation\nhas higher precision requirement on boundary area. However, this problem has\nnot been well studied in previous works. In this paper, we propose a\nboundary-sensitive deep neural network (BSN) for portrait segmentation. BSN\nintroduces three novel techniques. First, an individual boundary-sensitive\nkernel is proposed by dilating the contour line and assigning the boundary\npixels with multi-class labels. Second, a global boundary-sensitive kernel is\nemployed as a position sensitive prior to further constrain the overall shape\nof the segmentation map. Third, we train a boundary-sensitive attribute\nclassifier jointly with the segmentation network to reinforce the network with\nsemantic boundary shape information. We have evaluated BSN on the current\nlargest public portrait segmentation dataset, i.e, the PFCN dataset, as well as\nthe portrait images collected from other three popular image segmentation\ndatasets: COCO, COCO-Stuff, and PASCAL VOC. Our method achieves the superior\nquantitative and qualitative performance over state-of-the-arts on all the\ndatasets, especially on the boundary area.",
    "In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to discriminate between cultivated\nmaize plant and grass or grass-like weed image segments using the context\nsurrounding the image segments. While convolutional neural networks have\nbrought state of the art accuracies within object detection, errors arise when\nobjects in different classes share similar features. This scenario often occurs\nwhen objects in images are viewed at too small of a scale to discern distinct\ndifferences in features, causing images to be incorrectly classified or\nlocalized. To solve this problem, we will explore using context when\nclassifying image segments. This technique involves feeding a convolutional\nneural network a central square image along with a border of its direct\nsurroundings at train and test times. This means that although images are\nlabelled at a smaller scale to preserve accurate localization, the network\nclassifies the images and learns features that include the wider context. We\ndemonstrate the benefits of this context technique in the object detection task\nthrough a case study of grass (foxtail) and grass-like (yellow nutsedge) weed\ndetection in maize fields. In this standard situation, adding context alone\nnearly halved the error of the neural network from 7.1% to 4.3%. After only one\nepoch with context, the network also achieved a higher accuracy than the\nnetwork without context did after 50 epochs. The benefits of using the context\ntechnique are likely to particularly evident in agricultural contexts in which\nparts (such as leaves) of several plants may appear similar when not taking\ninto account the context in which those parts appear.",
    "  An information theoretic approach to bounds in superconformal field theories\nis proposed.

    "In the recent years, convolutional neural networks have transformed the field\nof medical image analysis due to their capacity to learn discriminative image\nfeatures for a variety of classification and regression tasks. However,\nsuccessfully learning these features requires a large amount of manually\nannotated data, which is expensive to acquire and limited by the available\nresources of expert image analysts. Therefore, unsupervised, weakly-supervised\nand self-supervised feature learning techniques receive a lot of attention,\nwhich aim to utilise the vast amount of available data, while at the same time\navoid or substantially reduce the effort of manual annotation. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel way for training a cardiac MR image segmentation network, in\nwhich features are learnt in a self-supervised manner by predicting anatomical\npositions.

We demonstrate that this seemingly simple task\nprovides a strong signal for feature learning and with self-supervised\nlearning, we achieve a high segmentation accuracy that is better than or\ncomparable to a U-net trained from scratch, especially at a small data setting.\nWhen only five annotated subjects are available, the proposed method improves\nthe mean Dice metric from 0.811 to 0.852 for short-axis image segmentation,\ncompared to the baseline U-net.",
    "Medical image segmentation plays an essential role in developing\ncomputer-assisted diagnosis and therapy systems, yet still faces many\nchallenges. In the past few years, the popular encoder-decoder architectures\nbased on CNNs (e.g., U-Net) have been successfully applied in the task of\nmedical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution\noperations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and\nlong-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce\ntransformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results,\nbut the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational\ncomplexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which\nintegrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and\naccurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder\nof the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the\nTransformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks\nand convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via\nskip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the\nfeature maps.

    "We propose adversarial constrained-CNN loss, a new paradigm of\nconstrained-CNN loss methods, for weakly supervised medical image segmentation.\nIn the new paradigm, prior knowledge is encoded and depicted by reference\nmasks, and is further employed to impose constraints on segmentation outputs\nthrough adversarial learning with reference masks. Unlike pseudo label methods\nfor weakly supervised segmentation, such reference masks are used to train a\ndiscriminator rather than a segmentation network, and thus are not required to\nbe paired with specific images. Our new paradigm not only greatly facilitates\nimposing prior knowledge on network's outputs, but also provides stronger and\nhigher-order constraints, i.e., distribution approximation, through adversarial\nlearning. Extensive experiments involving different medical modalities,\ndifferent anatomical structures, different topologies of the object of\ninterest, different levels of prior knowledge and weakly supervised annotations\nwith different annotation ratios is conducted to evaluate our ACCL method.\nConsistently superior segmentation results over the size constrained-CNN loss\nmethod have been achieved, some of which are close to the results of full\nsupervision, thus fully verifying the effectiveness and generalization of our\nmethod.

    "Automatic parsing of anatomical objects in X-ray images is critical to many\nclinical applications in particular towards image-guided invention and workflow\nautomation.

The\nTD-GAN framework is general and can be easily adapted to other learning tasks.\nIn the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and\n153 topograms.

We disprove this conjecture by showing that the\ncolors of singular points of the cycle may affect the dimensions. However, the\ncolors of smooth points are irrelevant. By using bistellar moves we show that\nthe number of different dimension vectors arising on a given 3-dimensional\npseudomanifold with isolated singularities is a topological invariant. This\ninvariant is trivial on manifolds, but nontrivial in general.\n",
    "In Computer Vision, edge detection is one of the favored approaches for\nfeature and object detection in images since it provides information about\ntheir objects boundaries. Other region-based approaches use probabilistic\nanalysis such as clustering and Markov random fields, but those methods cannot\nbe used to analyze edges and their interaction. In fact, only image\nsegmentation can produce regions based on edges, but it requires thresholding\nby simply separating the regions into binary in-out information. Hence, there\nis currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, since edges\ncannot be used to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The\nobjective of this paper is to present a novel spatial probability analysis that\nallows determining the probability of inclusion inside a set of partial\ncontours (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed a new approach that\nuses electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the\nrequired probabilities. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a continuous\nspace of probability based only on the edge information, thus bridging the gap\nbetween the edge-based methods and the region-based methods. The developed\nmethod is consistent with the fundamental properties of inclusion probabilities\nand its results are validated by comparing an image with the probability-based\nestimation given by our algorithm. The method can also be generalized to take\ninto consideration the intensity of the edges or to be used for 3D shapes. This\nis the first documented method that allows computing a space of probability\nbased on interacting edges, which opens the path to broader applications such\nas image segmentation and contour completion.",
    "America has a massive railway system. As of 2006, U.S. freight railroads have\n140,490 route- miles of standard gauge, but maintaining such a huge system and\neliminating any dangers, like reduced track stability and poor drainage, caused\nby railway ballast degradation require huge amount of labor. The traditional\nway to quantify the degradation of ballast is to use an index called Fouling\nIndex (FI) through ballast sampling and sieve analysis. However, determining\nthe FI values in lab is very time-consuming and laborious, but with the help of\nrecent development in the field of computer vision, a novel method for a\npotential machine-vison based ballast inspection system can be employed that\ncan hopefully replace the traditional mechanical method. The new machine-vision\napproach analyses the images of the in-service ballasts, and then utilizes\nimage segmentation algorithm to get ballast segments. By comparing the segment\nresults and their corresponding FI values, this novel method produces a\nmachine-vision-based index that has the best-fit relation with FI. The\nimplementation details of how this algorithm works are discussed in this\nreport.",
    "This paper aims at developing an integrated system of clothing co-parsing, in\norder to jointly parse a set of clothing images (unsegmented but annotated with\ntags) into semantic configurations. We propose a data-driven framework\nconsisting of two phases of inference. The first phase, referred as \"image\nco-segmentation\", iterates to extract consistent regions on images and jointly\nrefines the regions over all images by employing the exemplar-SVM (E-SVM)\ntechnique [23]. In the second phase (i.e. \"region co-labeling\"), we construct a\nmulti-image graphical model by taking the segmented regions as vertices, and\nincorporate several contexts of clothing configuration (e.g., item location and\nmutual interactions). The joint label assignment can be solved using the\nefficient Graph Cuts algorithm. In addition to evaluate our framework on the\nFashionista dataset [30], we construct a dataset called CCP consisting of 2098\nhigh-resolution street fashion photos to demonstrate the performance of our\nsystem. We achieve 90.29% / 88.23% segmentation accuracy and 65.52% / 63.89%\nrecognition rate on the Fashionista and the CCP datasets, respectively, which\nare superior compared with state-of-the-art methods.",
    "Color and intensity are two important components in an image. Usually, groups\nof image pixels, which are similar in color or intensity, are an informative\nrepresentation for an object. They are therefore particularly suitable for\ncomputer vision tasks, such as saliency detection and object proposal\ngeneration. However, image pixels, which share a similar real-world color, may\nbe quite different since colors are often distorted by intensity. In this\npaper, we reinvestigate the affinity matrices originally used in image\nsegmentation methods based on spectral clustering. A new affinity matrix, which\nis robust to color distortions, is formulated for object discovery. Moreover, a\nCohesion Measurement (CM) for object regions is also derived based on the\nformulated affinity matrix. Based on the new Cohesion Measurement, a novel\nobject discovery method is proposed to discover objects latent in an image by\nutilizing the eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. Then we apply the proposed\nmethod to both saliency detection and object proposal generation. Experimental\nresults on several evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CM based\nmethod has achieved promising performance for these two tasks.",
    "The automated segmentation of buildings in remote sensing imagery is a\nchallenging task that requires the accurate delineation of multiple building\ninstances over typically large image areas. Manual methods are often laborious\nand current deep-learning-based approaches fail to delineate all building\ninstances and do so with adequate accuracy. As a solution, we present Trainable\nDeep Active Contours (TDACs), an automatic image segmentation framework that\nintimately unites Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Active Contour\nModels (ACMs). The Eulerian energy functional of the ACM component includes\nper-pixel parameter maps that are predicted by the backbone CNN, which also\ninitializes the ACM. Importantly, both the ACM and CNN components are fully\nimplemented in TensorFlow and the entire TDAC architecture is end-to-end\nautomatically differentiable and backpropagation trainable without user\nintervention. TDAC yields fast, accurate, and fully automatic simultaneous\ndelineation of arbitrarily many buildings in the image. We validate the model\non two publicly available aerial image datasets for building segmentation, and\nour results demonstrate that TDAC establishes a new state-of-the-art\nperformance.",
    "We present a method combining affinity prediction with region agglomeration,\nwhich improves significantly upon the state of the art of neuron segmentation\nfrom electron microscopy (EM) in accuracy and scalability. Our method consists\nof a 3D U-NET, trained to predict affinities between voxels, followed by\niterative region agglomeration. We train using a structured loss based on\nMALIS, encouraging topologically correct segmentations obtained from affinity\nthresholding. Our extension consists of two parts: First, we present a\nquasi-linear method to compute the loss gradient, improving over the original\nquadratic algorithm. Second, we compute the gradient in two separate passes to\navoid spurious gradient contributions in early training stages. Our predictions\nare accurate enough that simple learning-free percentile-based agglomeration\noutperforms more involved methods used earlier on inferior predictions. We\npresent results on three diverse EM datasets, achieving relative improvements\nover previous results of 27%, 15%, and 250%. Our findings suggest that a single\nmethod can be applied to both nearly isotropic block-face EM data and\nanisotropic serial sectioned EM data. The runtime of our method scales linearly\nwith the size of the volume and achieves a throughput of about 2.6 seconds per\nmegavoxel, qualifying our method for the processing of very large datasets.",
    "  A single crystal of isovalently substituted Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ru$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$\n($x=0.24$) was sequentially irradiated with 2.5 MeV electrons up to a maximum\ndose of $2.1 \\times 10^{19}$ electrons/cm^2. The electrical resistivity was\nmeasured \\textit{in - situ} at $T=$22 K during the irradiation and \\textit{ex -\nsitu} as a function of temperature between subsequent irradiation runs. Upon\nirradiation, the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, decreases and\nthe residual resistivity, $\\rho_0$, increases. We find that electron\nirradiation leads to the fastest suppression of $T_c$ compared to other types\nof artificially introduced disorder, probably due to the strong short-range\npotential of the point-like irradiation defects. A more detailed analysis\nwithin a multiband scenario with variable scattering potential strength shows\nthat the observed $T_c$ vs. $\\rho_0$ is fully compatible with $s_\\pm$ pairing,\nin contrast to earlier claims that this model leads to a too rapid a\nsuppression of $T_c$ with scattering.\n",
    "  A Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) physics program of three LAr-TPC detectors\nlocated along the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab is presented. This\nnew SBN Program will deliver a rich and compelling physics opportunity,\nincluding the ability to resolve a class of experimental anomalies in neutrino\nphysics and to perform the most sensitive search to date for sterile neutrinos\nat the eV mass-scale through both appearance and disappearance oscillation\nchannels.

    "Image foreground extraction is a classical problem in image processing and\nvision, with a large range of applications. In this dissertation, we focus on\nthe extraction of text and graphics in mixed-content images, and design novel\napproaches for various aspects of this problem.\n  We first propose a sparse decomposition framework, which models the\nbackground by a subspace containing smooth basis vectors, and foreground as a\nsparse and connected component. We then formulate an optimization framework to\nsolve this problem, by adding suitable regularizations to the cost function to\npromote the desired characteristics of each component. We present two\ntechniques to solve the proposed optimization problem, one based on alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM), and the other one based on robust\nregression. Promising results are obtained for screen content image\nsegmentation using the proposed algorithm.\n  We then propose a robust subspace learning algorithm for the representation\nof the background component using training images that could contain both\nbackground and foreground components, as well as noise. With the learnt\nsubspace for the background, we can further improve the segmentation results,\ncompared to using a fixed subspace. Lastly, we investigate a different class of\nsignal/image decomposition problem, where only one signal component is active\nat each signal element. In this case, besides estimating each component, we\nneed to find their supports, which can be specified by a binary mask. We\npropose a mixed-integer programming problem, that jointly estimates the two\ncomponents and their supports through an alternating optimization scheme. We\nshow the application of this algorithm on various problems, including image\nsegmentation, video motion segmentation, and also separation of text from\ntextured images.",
    "  We develop a system for measurements of power spectra of transmitted light\nintensity fluctuations, in which the extraneous noise, including shot noise, is\nreduced. In essence, we just apply light, measure the power of the transmitted\nlight and derive its power spectrum. We use this to observe the spontaneous\nnoise spectra of photon atom interactions. Applying light with frequency\nmodulation, we can also observe the spontaneous noise reflecting the coherence\nbetween the hyperfine levels in the excited state. There are two in novel\ncomponents in the measurement system, the noise reduction scheme and the\nstabilization of the laser system. The noise reduction mechanism can be used to\nreduce the shot noise contribution to arbitrarily low levels through averaging,\nin principle. This is combined with differential detection to keep unwanted\nnoise at low levels. The laser system is stabilized to obtain spectral width\nbelow 1\\,kHz without high frequency ($\\gtrsim10\\,$MHz) noise. These methods are\ndescribed systematically and the performance of the asurement system is\nexamined through experimental results.\n",
    "  We propose a new class of models specifically tailored for spatio-temporal\ndata analysis. To this end, we generalize the spatial autoregressive model with\nautoregressive and heteroskedastic disturbances, i.e. SARAR(1,1), by exploiting\nthe recent advancements in Score Driven (SD) models typically used in time\nseries econometrics. In particular, we allow for time-varying spatial\nautoregressive coefficients as well as time-varying regressor coefficients and\ncross-sectional standard deviations. We report an extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulation study in order to investigate the finite sample properties of the\nMaximum Likelihood estimator for the new class of models as well as its\nflexibility in explaining several dynamic spatial dependence processes.

    "The performance of deep networks for semantic image segmentation largely\ndepends on the availability of large-scale training images which are labelled\nat the pixel level. Typically, such pixel-level image labellings are obtained\nmanually by a labour-intensive process. To alleviate the burden of manual image\nlabelling, we propose an interesting learning approach to generate pixel-level\nimage labellings automatically. A Guided Filter Network (GFN) is first\ndeveloped to learn the segmentation knowledge from a source domain, and such\nGFN then transfers such segmentation knowledge to generate coarse object masks\nin the target domain. Such coarse object masks are treated as pseudo labels and\nthey are further integrated to optimize/refine the GFN iteratively in the\ntarget domain. Our experiments on six image sets have demonstrated that our\nproposed approach can generate fine-grained object masks (i.e., pixel-level\nobject labellings), whose quality is very comparable to the manually-labelled\nones. Our proposed approach can also achieve better performance on semantic\nimage segmentation than most existing weakly-supervised approaches.",
    "Tensor networks provide an efficient approximation of operations involving\nhigh dimensional tensors and have been extensively used in modelling quantum\nmany-body systems. More recently, supervised learning has been attempted with\ntensor networks, primarily focused on tasks such as image classification.

We use the matrix product state (MPS) tensor network on non-overlapping\npatches of a given input image to predict the segmentation mask by learning a\npixel-wise linear classification rule in a high dimensional space. The proposed\nmodel is end-to-end trainable using backpropagation. It is implemented as a\nStrided Tensor Network to reduce the parameter complexity. The performance of\nthe proposed method is evaluated on two public medical imaging datasets and\ncompared to relevant baselines.

    "  A path in an edge-colored graph $G$ is rainbow if no two edges of it are\ncolored the same. The graph $G$ is rainbow-connected if there is a rainbow path\nbetween every pair of vertices.

    "All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.\nMoazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn't do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don't see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.",
    "Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"",

They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos.

The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.

Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.\n\"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over. What can you do but laugh about it? It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.\n\"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\"",

    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it.

    "AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United \"know they made a mistake\" by selling him in 2001.\nThe sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. \"United made a mistake in selling me,\" Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. \"I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. \"There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?\"\nWednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. \"We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone,\" he said. \"Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. \"I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do.\"",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",

    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.\nVedomosti newspaper reported that Russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\nGazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.",
    "Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.\nAlan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.

    "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.\nInbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",

    "You can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.",
    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.",
    "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\nMr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

    "Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has played down reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona.\n\"He's been responding well to treatment and started running on Friday, but we'll have to wait and see,\" he told BBC Five Live's Sportsweek. \"We're looking to getting him back as soon as possible, but he'll be back when it's right for him and for us. \"There's no plans at the moment around the Barcelona game.\" His comments contradict those of chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman who treated the Dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of February. Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.

    "Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 \n - A freeze on petrol duty \n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.\"\nBut Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.",
    "Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"\nThe Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n\"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages.

    "Jesper Gronkjaer has agreed a move to Atletico Madrid from Birmingham City.\nThe 27-year-old winger spent just five months at St Andrews following a £2.2m move from Chelsea in July after playing for Denmark at Euro 2004. He is set to move during the January transfer window in a deal rumoured to be about £1.4m, subject to a medical. \"We will meet with the player's representative to finalise the contract and decide when he will sign,\" said Atletico sporting director Toni Munoz. Gronkjaer has been targeted by Blues fans and was sarcastically applauded when taken off against Everton last month. Boss Steve Bruce had said that he would be happy to let the Danish international go if the price was right. He added: \"I'm not going to say the decision to let him go is down to the fans' reaction towards him.\n\"He has had a tough time since the summer with the loss of his mother and finding it difficult to adjust to a new club and a different area. \"He has been terrific and not missed a day's training and is someone if your daughter brought them home you would be delighted. \"It just hasn't quite worked out here for him.

    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W.

There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",
    "World 5000m champion Eliud Kipchoge won the 9.2km race at the View From Great Edinburgh Cross Country.\nThe Kenyan, who was second when Newcastle hosted the race last year, was in front from the outset. Ethiopian duo Gebre Gebremariam and Dejene Berhanu made last-gasp efforts to overtake him, but Kipchoge responded and a burst of speed clinched victory. Gavin Thompson was the first Briton in 12th place while Nick McCormick held of his British rivals to win the 4km race. The Morpeth Harrier led from the end of the first lap and ended Mike Skinner and Andrew Baddeley's hopes with a surge in the lasp lap. \"My training has gone so well I wasn't really worried about the opposition asI knew I was in great shape,\" said McCormick, who now hopes to earn a 1,500m place in the British team for the World Championships in Helsinki. In the women's race, Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba won a battle with world cross country champion Benita Johnson to retain her title. Australian Johnson, who shocked her African rivals in Brussels last March, looked to be on course for another win in the 6.2km race. But world 5000m champion Dibaba make a telling strike for the finishing line in the final 20 metres. Britons Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling were out of contention early on.",
    "Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. But what you will not find is much Spanish-language hip-hop.\nHip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now, a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. They have a devoted fan base in their native Monterrey. But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\nTheir biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O'Leary. \"I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.",
    "The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.\nIt is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.\nOnce completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. \"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,\" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.\nIn second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.\nSince the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",

    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. \"He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did,\" Keegan said. \"He has worked hard to get back to where he is now.\" The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"",
    "Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner.

    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.\nAfter Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: \"It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. \"We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.\" Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. \"It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams.\"",
    "Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"",
    "Pop singer Delta Goodrem has scooped one of the top individual prizes at the first Australian MTV Music Awards.\nThe 21-year-old singer won the award for best female artist, with Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll taking the title of best male at the ceremony. Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won awards for best R 'n' B video and sexiest video, both for Hey Mama. Local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins took the title of breakthrough artist of the year, with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian taking the honours for best pop video. The VH1 First Music Award went to Cher honouring her achievements within the music industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbour and was hosted by the Osbourne family. Artists including Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osbourne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia gave live performances at the event.",
    "Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.\nMoya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\"",
    "A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's \"lackadaisical\" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.\nPublic accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was \"dragging its heels\".\nThat comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been \"dreadfully slow\" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.\nThe outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. \"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,\" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.\nMinisters had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between \"two and three times\" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, \"but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations\".\nMr Leigh said being \"better prepared\" would also help avoid the need for \"mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak\". A Defra spokesman said: \"We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. \"However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.\"",
    "Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.\nThe beta program only works on PCs running Windows XP or Windows 2000. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files. Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.\n\"Our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft's MSN internet division. Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program. The software giant is coming late to the desktop search arena, competing with a large number of rivals. Google has already released a desktop tool. Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year. Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",

But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn't let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life.

    "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\nAgriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.",
    "Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's \"bullying\" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.\nShe said \"superior\" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen's former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said. She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking \"agendas\".\n\"I had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are.\" Media observers had been surprised by Greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: \"I'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I don't discuss them. \"I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them.\" Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.\nOther celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.\nVOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?   Yes  No   Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion\nHappy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still \"wide open\", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1. DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes.

    "Tony Blair has pledged to \"never, ever, ever\" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.\nThe prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: \"If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically.\" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were \"anti-Semitic\". These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\nMr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\nRates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
    "Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.",
    "Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?\"",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"",

Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.

    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.\nNew owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.",
    "The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \n \nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \n \nUniversal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425). \n \nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). \n \nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n \nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n \nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",
    "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",
    "Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\nThe thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.\nThese online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn't lead it.\"\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,\" said Mr Nachison. \"And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.\"",
    "China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week. Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT.",
    "Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.",
    "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
    "Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.\nMore than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club.\nAnelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: \"I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. \"We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club.\" Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: \"There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka.\n\"If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. \"If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. \"We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that.\" Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: \"I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. \"If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. \"But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. \"He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club.\" City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: \"Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. \"We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing.\"",
    "The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\nThe Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\nCampaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\nIn a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\nSaying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\nMr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\nLabour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.",

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"",

Lee told them to \"work up the corporate ladder because everybody can't be an actor, everybody can't make a record\". He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films.\nReturning to his old university, which educates only African American students, Lee discussed the challenges facing black people in the entertainment industry. \"Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,\" Lee said. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. \"It's a huge market,\" the 47-year-old director said. \"It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild.\" Lee has made more than 25 films, including Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, Summer of Sam and 1986 hit She's Gotta Have It.",
    "Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.\nLaunched this week, the World Community Grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.\nAnyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the WGC website. Once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.\nThe subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.\n\"The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,\" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. \"[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems\", she added. IBM has donated the hardware, software, technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid.

News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",
    "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "Campaigners against the expansion of Britain's airports have begun challenging the government's plans in the High Court.\nBAA's expansion of Stansted Airport in Essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. Opponents say the £2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used. They said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick. They have said they cannot raise the money needed for the Stansted upgrades from current landing charges. BAA also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. Their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at Luton Airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at Heathrow. If the group wins, the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport White Paper could be left in ruins.\nThe campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the Isle of Sheppey east of London. Lord Hanningfield, leader of Essex County Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are going to the High Court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. \"We want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation, consultation and thought before the government came out with its Green Paper. \"Then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.\" He added: \"Politicians should not decide where runways should be.\" The Stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.\nThe airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the UK. But BAA has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. BAA is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.",
    "Olympic champion Justine Henin-Hardenne will return to action in January's Sydney International tournament.\nThe Belgian has not competed since losing her top world ranking at the US Open in September, where she was beaten in the fourth round by Nadia Petrova. She took time out to shake off a virus but will defend her titles in Sydney and at the Australian Open. Women's world number one Lindsay Davenport and French Open champion Anastasia Myskina will also compete.\nIn the men's event, world number three Lleyton Hewitt returns to defend his title, along with runner-up Carlos Moya. Moya, Spain's Davis Cup final hero in their recent win over the US, had to retire with an ankle injury in the first set of the final.\nTournament director Craig Watson said: \"I had a message relayed to me from him after Spain's Davis Cup victory, saying he was looking forward to trying to make up for his disappointment in the (2004) final. The tournament will take place from 9-15 January.",
    "What have the European Indoor trials told us? Well, I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects.\nIt was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.\nThe best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton's win in the 60m hurdles. Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. But what was great about Sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. Diane Allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah. And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head-to-head race will give Sarah confidence. In the men's race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. In fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid.\nPhillips Idowu lit up the field events, not only with his hair, but also with his leap of 17.30m, which puts him at the top of the world rankings. I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. He feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then Phillips always has. A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance. He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. Across the board I thought Kelly Sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. She picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than that. Kelly will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far.\nShe has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. It wasn't all good news in Sheffield. I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. Jason Gardener may have won but he wasn't at his best. I chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. He's there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. In the women's race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka. The pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but Joice had to pull out with a chest infection. If she had made the final I think Jeanette would have gone a bit quicker.\nJanine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case. The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her. A couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding Mark Findlay and Rabah Yusuf. Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for Great Britain. Yusuf, who came third in the 400m, is from the Sudan but is trying to gain British citizenship. He came to Britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe, started doing more running and found his talent. So we shall have to see what happens to both of them.",
    "Oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.\nLondon Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. \"It's amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.\nThe stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month highs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of Thursday.\nIn London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.\nThe price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.\nFears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in north America would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise. \"Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,\" said Kyle Cooper, at Citigroup Global Markets. \"Long term I think we're headed to $30-35 but I don't think we're doing that yet. We have a lot of winter left.\" John Person, president of National Futures Advisory Services, said the EIA data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the US. .",
    "The blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog Ofcom has said.\nContent on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV-quality video online becomes a norm. At a debate in Westminster, the net industry considered the options. Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. At the debate, organised by the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA), Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.\n\"The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves,\" he said. Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion.\nSome studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net. More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB, ITV and the BBC. Head of the division, Andrew Burke, spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. \"How risque can I be in this new age? With celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners, surely I can push it to the limit,\" he said.\nIn fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. Internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the Law Commission dubbed them \"mere conduits\" back in 2002. This defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. The level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali, said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. Huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the BBC offer TV content over the net. The BBC's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as EastEnders and Top Gear will make net TV mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions, he said.\nOne of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee, said Mr Ayers. As inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT. Mr Allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of \"impossible to regulate\" and \"just apply offline laws online\". In fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content. After Lord Currie departed, the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. \"If content is on-demand, consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them, then it is the consumers' choice to watch it. There is no watershed on the net,\" said Mr Burke.",
    "Hearts manager John Robertson hopes a place in the knock-out stages of the Uefa Cup could help keep some of his out-of-contract players at the club.\n\"It could help. If we get through and have another European tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season,\" he said. \"If we manage to get through it shows how well the club's progressing. \"They have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on.\" A win for Robertson's side against Ferencvaros would put them through to the last 32 if Basle fail to beat Feyenoord. \"It's very much the player's prerogative but the fact that we've been playing European football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive,\" added Robertson. \"But we want players who want to play for the football club, who are committed and a run in Europe always helps a little bit.\" With the game being played at Murrayfield instead of Tynecastle because of Uefa regulations, Robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue.\n\"The pitch is not in the greatest condition. The Heineken Cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is a bit threadbare,\" he said. \"It's not ideal but it's the same for both teams so we just have to go out and there and perform. That's the most important thing.\" But he added: \"If Tynecastle could have hosted 30,000 it would have been fantastic but that's one of the benefits of Murrayfield - it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it. \"There will be a good atmosphere and the Hearts fans have an important role to play. \"We need their encouragement, we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible. \"Hopefully the players will respond to that and I know they will because it's a fantastic European night for the club.\"",
    "A film based on the internet musings of the \"Baghdad Blogger\" has been shown at the Rotterdam Film Festival.\nThe film has been directed by the man who calls himself Salam Pax, the author of the weblog about Iraqi life during and after the war. The movie version comes in the form of a series of shorts made by Pax on a hand-held camera. Baghdad Blogger is among a number of films about Iraq showcased at the Dutch festival, which runs until Sunday. Following the fascination with the writing of Salam Pax - not his real name - he began a regular column in The Guardian newspaper and was given a crash course in documentary film-making. For the film he travelled Iraq to document the changing landscape of the country and the problems it has faced since the invasion, speaking to ordinary Iraqis about their experiences. The festival will also see the screening of Underexposure, one of Iraq's first features to emerge since the toppling of Saddam Hussein.\nDirector Oday Rasheed made the film on discarded 1980s Kodak film taken from the remains for the former Ministry of Culture building. It centres on the lives of families and strangers going about their everyday business as Baghdad is under siege. Rasheed said the title was refers to the isolation felt by Iraqis under Saddam's regime and the difficult time the country is now experiencing. \"Saddam's regime was hell, but now I think the hell has doubled,\" Rasheed said. The festival was also due to screen murdered Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh's film about the treatment of woman under Islam, but it was withdrawn due to safety fears. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed in November 2004, following death threats he received about his film Submission.",
    "The Conservative Party would deal \"sympathetically\" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.\nDr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for \"vindictiveness\" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.\nA jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.\nHe won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. Dr Fox was asked if he would say yes or no if Lord Archer applied to rejoin. \"I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. \"I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell.\"\nTory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. \"After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,\" he added. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. He said: \"I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. But there is no doubt it would be controversial.\" Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.",
    "The creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is to take on a new female superhero after signing up to write and direct the Wonder Woman movie.\nJoss Whedon described the DC Comics character as \"the most iconic female heroine of our time\". \"In a way, no one has met her yet,\" he said. \"What I love most about icons is finding out what's behind them, exploring the price of their power.\" Linda Carter played the character in the 1970s TV series. The character of Wonder Woman, famed for her red and gold costume, was born on Paradise Island, and was blessed with the powers of strength and flight. The film is being produced by Joel Silver, producer of the Matrix trilogy.\n\"There's no one better than Joss to adapt the legendary Wonder Woman comic book character created in the 1940s into a dynamic feature film for 21st Century audiences,\" said Silver. \"Wonder Woman was the first great female superhero to emerge from comic books and later inspire millions of fans in her television incarnation... but this groundbreaking heroine has yet to be reinvented for the feature film arena.\" Whedon created the character of Buffy in the screenplay for the 1992 film. He distanced himself from the movie because of the direction it eventually took, and the film bombed. But he did not give up on the Slayer and went on to write and executive produce seven seasons of the cult TV series. He also produced the spin-off Angel series. He is currently directing the film Serenity, based on his short-lived sci-fi series Firefly.",
    "The prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial, saying \"several hundred\" people in the UK are plotting terror attacks.\nThe government is facing opposition from Tory and Lib Dem MPs and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final Commons debate on the changes. But Tony Blair said there could be no concession on the \"basic principle\". Mr Blair told the BBC the \"control orders\" would only be used in the most limited circumstances. Critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. But the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders, instead saying judges will be able to quash them.\nAn explanation is being sent by Home Secretary Charles Clarke to all MPs and peers ahead of the final debate in the House of Commons. On Sunday, Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders. And Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. Some 32 Labour MPs voted against the legislation last week. Barbara Follett, whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in South Africa during the apartheid era, confirmed she would vote against the government.\nBut the government is continuing to insist that \"control orders\" must be issued by the home secretary. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: \"We are being advised by the police and the security services... \"What they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt. \"And these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances.\"\nA YouGov poll in the Daily Telegraph suggested 75% of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. But Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC News that the government was again making a mistake in \"rushing\" anti-terrorism legislation. \"I very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this.\" He said after meeting Tony Blair he had been left with the impression that \"he really wasn't interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward\". Mr Clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects - something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights. BBC political correspondent Vicky Young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the House of Lords, where Labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties. Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group Liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue. She said the legislation was \"a travesty and a perversion of justice\" and would remain \"unpalatable\" even if a judge was involved early in the process.",
    "Manchester United's Alex Ferguson has praised his players' gutsy performance in the 1-0 win at Aston Villa.\n\"That was our hardest away game of the season and it was a fantastic game of football, end-to-end with lots of good passing,\" said the Old Trafford boss. \"We showed lots of character and guts and we weren't going to lose. \"I look at that fixture and think we've been there and won, while Arsenal and Chelsea have yet to come and Villa may have some players back when they do.\" Ferguson also hailed senior stars Ryan Giggs and Roy Keane, who came off the bench for the injured John O'Shea. \"Roy came on and brought a bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got. \"Giggs was a tremendous threat and he brings tremendous penetration. \"All we can do is maintain our form, play as we are and we'll get our rewards.\"",
    "Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand, who shot to prominence in 2004, have won two Brit Awards.\nWith their self-titled debut, Franz Ferdinand have achieved what most rock bands crave - high credibility and critical acclaim while also selling stacks of CDs. They have risen to the head of the UK's art rock ranks with an album of songs that are catchy, creative and original enough to sound fresh. With a cool, spiky, fun sound previously associated with bands like Talking Heads, they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. Their first UK single hit number three last January, followed by two more top 20 hits, while the album has sold more than 600,000 copies in 11 months on release. In September it was named album of the year winning the prestigious Mercury Music Prize.\nOn the festivals circuit, they have been one of the main attractions for huge crowds at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Reading/Leeds. They have also found success in Japan, Europe and the US. By September the album had sold 500,000 in the States and total sales were pushing two million worldwide. They have been nominated for three Grammy awards in the US as well as the US music industry's Shortlist award, but lost the Shortlist prize to US band TV on the Radio. Nevertheless Franz Ferdinand were the only UK band to win an MTV Video Music Award this year, taking the breakthrough video crown for Take Me Out.\nThe four-piece met two years ago when drummer Paul Thomson was working at the Glasgow art school where bassist Bob Hardy was studying. Singer Alex Kapranos was studying English at university but had friends at art school, and the line-up was completed when guitarist Nick McCarthy moved from Munich, Germany, to the city. At the turn of the year, Kapranos told BBC News Online the band were fed up with serious bands in \"that post-rock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune\".\n\"We want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. But at the same time bringing an edge to it.\" Franz Ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song, Kapranos said. \"Where's the fun in that?\" they pondered at every stage, making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors. The band started out with a DIY ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in Glasgow and rename it The Chateau. The venue soon became legendary - so well-known that the police spent a month trying to find it, eventually raiding it and arresting Kapranos. But the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety, fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped.\nThe band took over an abandoned Victorian courtroom and jail instead, and named that The Chateau. The buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and 40 record labels turned up to one gig in Glasgow - which the band thought was \"totally ridiculous\". \"I'm really glad it was almost comical because we weren't overwhelmed by the seriousness of it,\" Kapranos said. They signed with independent label Domino, home of Smog, Sebadoh and Four Tet, in June 2003.",

    "German business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy.\nMunich-based research institute Ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in February from 97.5 in January, its first decline in three months. The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\n\"We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\nGermany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.",
    "The top civil servant at the centre of the David Blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the New Year Honours.\nSir John Gieve was Home Office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with Mr Blunkett quitting. He and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny came to be fast-tracked. The outgoing head of the troubled Child Support Agency Doug Smith also earns an honour in the New Year's list. Mr Smith, 57, whose retirement was announced by Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Smith in November, is made a Commander of the Order of Bath.\nBoth men were giving evidence to a Commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. The knighting of Sir John, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians.\nThe Liberal Democrats said it \"beggared belief\" he and fellow officials could not remember how Leoncia Casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain went from Mr Blunkett's office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department. Meanwhile, the Conservatives accused officials of a \"collective failure\" of memory. But Sir Alan Budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.\nDowning Street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: \"You have to look at their whole career.\" Sir John was made permanent secretary in April 2001 following a Civil Service career which dates back to 1974. He has also worked in the Treasury and the Department of Employment. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said of Mr Smith's honour: \"The award reflects all that he has achieved in a Civil Service career, principally in the Inland Revenue, spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the Child Support Agency.\n\"In his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes.\" Mr Smith is set to stay on at the CSA until March. Less controversial will be the knighthoods for Derek Wanless and Mike Tomlinson, who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively. Former NatWest chief executive Mr Wanless, 57, has delivered not one but two major reports on the NHS. Ex-chief inspector of schools Mr Tomlinson, 62, has recommended replacing A-Levels and GCSEs with a new diploma system in a shake-up of the exams system.",
    "Scarlets and USA Eagles forward Dave Hodges has ended his playing career to pursue a coaching role in the States.\nThe 36-year-old, who has 54 caps, was Llanelli's player of the season in 2001/2, but has battled injury for the last two of his seven years at Stradey. He tore a pectoral muscle against the Ospreys on Boxing Day, an injury that would have kept him out for the season. \"Realising I would be unable to play this season, the club and I agreed to end my contract early,\" said Hodges.\n\"It allows me to move back to the US and pursue opportunities there and allows the Scarlets to look to the next generation.\" The Scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing Heineken Cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks.\nScarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher confirmed that 17 of the current squad would be out of contract in the summer. \"We have a deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they won't all be re-signed, it's a chance to invigorate the squad,\" he said. \"I'm positive about the future of the Scarlets both on and off the field.\" Gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back-five forward Hodges has played at Stradey Park, though. \"David has been a highly influential member of our squad for seven years,\" said Gallacher. \"He is a real professional and we thank him for the part he has played in our success. \"I am sure he has an enormous contribution to make to the development of rugby in the US and we wish him and his family well.\" Hodges described his years at Stradey as \"the best time of my life.\"",
    "Rap mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight has been arrested for violating his parole after he was allegedly found with marijuana.\nHe was arrested in Barstow, California, on Saturday following an alleged traffic offence. He is expected to be transferred to a state prison while a decision is made on whether he should be released. Mr Knight, founder of Death Row Records, served a 10-month jail term in 2004 for punching a man while on parole for an assault conviction. Police said Mr Knight was stopped on Saturday after performing an illegal U-turn and a search of his car allegedly found marijuana.\nHe is also accused of not having insurance. A 18-year-old woman in the car was arrested for providing false information and having a fake ID card. She was later released. It was his second alleged violation, having previously served half of a nine-year sentence for breaking the terms of his parole. Mr Knight, 39, was jailed in October 1996 following his involvement in a fight with a rival gang just hours before rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in a Las Vegas drive-by shooting. He was driving Shakur's car at the time and was shot in the head. At the time he was on probation for assaulting two musicians. Mr Knight, a former bodyguard, set up Death Row records in the early 1990s with Shakur and Dr Dre among his protegees. But the label has always been dogged by allegations it supports gang culture and fuels the east and west coast rap rivalry.",
    "South Korea's Hyundai Motor has announced that it plans to build a second plant in India to meet the country's growing demand for cars.\nThe company didn't give details of its investment but it said the new plant would produce 150,000 cars a year. This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. Hyundai expects its sales in India to grow 16% to 250,000 in 2005. By 2010, it expects to nearly double sales to 400,000 cars. The new plant will be built close to the existing one in Chennai, in the southern province of Tamil Nadu.\nSouth Korea's top car maker estimates that the Indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1.6 million vehicles by 2010. Demand in India has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. Figures show that currently only eight people per thousand are car owners. \"We desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the Indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors,\" chairman Chung Mong-koo said in the statement. He said the company plans to use India as a base for exports to Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The company - which controls half of the South Korean's market - aims to become a global top five auto maker by 2010.",
    "The remaining members of rock band Queen are to go on tour next year with former Free and Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers taking Freddie Mercury's place.\nGuitarist Brian May has said he expects to be on the road with Rodgers and drummer Roger Taylor from April. May said: \"Suddenly the Queen Phoenix is rising again from the ashes and will take precedence over... our lives.\" Queen have played with many different singers since Mercury's death in 1991 but have reportedly not toured. May performed with Rodgers at a concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar in London in September.\n\"We were both so amazed at the chemistry that was going on in [Free hit] All Right Now, that suddenly it seems blindingly obvious that there was 'something happening here,'\" May wrote on his website. They teamed up again for a concert to mark their induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and were joined by Taylor. \"The show went so incredibly well from our point of view, and we got so many rave reactions from out there, we decided almost then and there that we would look at a tour together,\" May wrote.\nQueen went to number one in 2000 with a version of We Will Rock You sung by boy band 5ive and they have also played with Robbie Williams, Will Young and Bob Geldof. Queen bassist John Deacon has currently retired from the stage. Rodgers was singer with early 1970s rockers Free, who had a global hit with All Right Now, before forming Bad Company, a successful \"supergroup\" with members of King Crimson and Mott the Hoople. He has also been in The Firm with Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and The Law with The Small Faces and The Who drummer Kenny Jones.",
    "Jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant Yukos to a business partner.\nMr Khodorkovsky handed over his entire 59.5% stake in holding company Group Menatep - which controls Yukos - to Leonid Nevzlin. A close ally of the ex-Yukos boss, Mr Nevzlin is currently based in Israel. Mr Khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of Yukos' core oil production unit, Yuganskneftegaz to pay a giant tax bill.\nYuganskneftegaz was sold off at auction in December last year, eventually falling into the hands of state oil firm Rosneft in a deal worth $9.4bn (£5bn). \"Since the sale of Yuganskneftegaz, I have been delivered of (all) responsibility for the business that remains and the group's money as a whole,\" Mr Khodorkovsky said. \"It is all over. As before, I see my future in public activity to build a civil society in Russia.\" Mr Nevzlin is Yukos' largest shareholder but is living in self-imposed exile in Israel. Yuganskneftegaz pumps around 1 million barrels of oil a day. It was sold by the Russian authorities to recover government tax claims against Yukos totalling over $27bn. Previously considered to be Russia's richest man, with an estimated fortune of $15bn, Mr Khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in October 2003. However, the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs. It is also believed that Mr Khodorkovsky was particularly targeted because he had started to bankroll political opponents of Mr Putin.",
    "India's biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos.\n\"We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia,\" said ONGC chairman Subir Raha. Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos' former key oil production unit for $2bn (£1bn). Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.\nIt was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.\nState-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGC's plans during a trip to Moscow last year, and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putin's recent visit to New Delhi. \"It would make great sense for us to build on that,\" said Mr Aiyar. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. At the same time, India's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.\nIndia produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\n\"For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,\" said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India is a \"dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil\". By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. \"We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline,\" Mr Westwood said. \"By 2020, production may only be at half of today's levels.\" ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russia's Siberian coast.\nONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk.\nChinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on Thursday, Italy refused to rule out an interest. ONGC's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.",
    "Online role playing games are time-consuming, but enthralling flights from reality. But are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously?\nWhen video game World of Warcraft hit the shops in Europe last week fans wrote in to the BBC website to express their delight - and to offer a warning. \"An addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time,\" wrote Travis Anderson, in Texas. Some of the comments were humorous: \"This game is so good I'm not going to get it, there's no way I could limit the hours I'd spend playing it,\" wrote Charles MacIntyre, from England.\nBut some struck a more worrying tone about the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG): \"'You need to get out more' could be the motto of any MMORPG. Shame they are getting more popular, as you know this problem is just going to mushroom,\" wrote Stuart Stanton-Davies, in Huddersfield. Scare-mongering articles about \"addictive video games\" have existed since the days the first game of Pong stopped everyone from working at the Atari offices.\nGaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym, in front of the television, or reading poetry.\nUnfortunately, gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make. However, stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent. And the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some.\nMassively multiplayer online role playing games - MMORPGs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds. The scope of these games - like Warcraft, EverQuest, Ultima among others - is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite. Part of the \"problem\" is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded, mindless tasks, to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure. Such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing; not for no reason is EverQuest (EQ) nicknamed EverCrack. E Hayot, writing in the culture blogzine Print Culture, said recently: \"I used to play the online role-playing game EverQuest a lot. \"By 'a lot', I mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average, and on weeks where I didn't have to work, as many as 30 or 40 hours.\"\nHe says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour \"wasn't that unusual; lots of people I knew in the game played EQ that much\". \"You lie; you don't go into work because you \"had stuff to do at home\"; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner, you spend much less time watching TV (a good thing, presumably),\" he wrote, explaining how EverQuest took over his time. He quit the game, he says, because he realised life was more fun than EverQuest.\nLet us be clear - such obsession is rare. But the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far. Almost 400,000 people bought a copy of World of Warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month. Only a fraction will descend into obsessives. The thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by EverQuest can be found on one blog EverQuest Daily Grind. Jane, who runs the website, compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories. \"I am actually convinced at this point that there are more than 'some' people who spend more times in MMOPRGs than in reality,\" she said. One unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote: \"On the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as I do, I find that I am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me.\n\"I can't talk to him while he is playing. There is absolutely no point as he doesn't hear me or is so distracted that I get a 'ummm... ya' a few minutes after I ask him a question.\"\n\"Gaming widows\" has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers. But for some it is not in the least funny. Another correspondent wrote: \"I believe that he is addicted to the online gaming, and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness.\" And some of them are even sadder: \"Today our son was five days old. \"The sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his Warcraft game. He did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online.\" Video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised. But as gaming becomes ever more mainstream, and games ever more immersive, there will be no hiding place for social problems.\nI wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but I think it probably isn't. An 11 hour stretch isn't that surprising - I've known people to play 15+ hours at a stretch. I know of people who are spending their week's holiday from work playing Warcraft. I know of people who would play Ever[Crack] in shifts...waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they 'needed' to appear. I understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life. By all standards many of us are addicts. So is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing..or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting?\nSadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming, I find myself longing to have the time to join them. I have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began, games have become more and more complex. And more and more so I find I have less and less time to play them, with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time.\nI think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct. I play games a lot, definately over 20 hours a week, but I don't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.\nI have, about a year ago, deleted every game on my computer. RPGs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword. Unlike books, or perhaps even TV, you gain absolutely nothing. When you stop playing you're at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and, since you've gained nothing in the real world, you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.\nDespite having little monetary value, the \"rewards\" and encouragement offered by these MMORPGs is enough to hook games for hours daily. If only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition. Perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality?\nMy advice to gaming widows is \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\". That is, try playing it yourself. If he wants to play as well, well at least you'll be together somewhere...\nI was an addict and it cost me my relationship. I still play now, but without the guilt , hehe, How long have i played in one sitting? From morning till the early hours of the next day, the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain, i would hardly eat, perhaps some toast, smoke endlessly and drink. Now, thankfully the fascination has worn off and I have a girlfriend but still no job. For the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement, and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate.\nObsessive behaviour is, of course, always cause for concern, but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of \"reality\". Obviously, somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing EverQuest has a problem. This problem, however, has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality. An obsessive EQ player does not consider the game to be \"real\" any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human. If MMORPGs have a unique danger, in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour, it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world, but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7. The problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming, but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture.\nThe problem with these so called MMORPGS is that you can never really complete them, there's always another quest to do. A few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday...\nChampionship Manager consumed my life for years. One particular session started at about 2pm on a Sunday, paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the Monday and after visit to University for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session. The people who tend to hark on about about the problems of \"hardcore gaming\" seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game. I would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that.\nI used to be an EverQuest addict while I was in college. It came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one. I failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate. I was lucky that I came to my senses when I did, others were less fortunate and dropped out of college. Now that I am holding a job, I avoid online RPGS like the plague.\nWhen I was made redundant I told my partner I had a new job for three months whilst every day I played EverQuest from 7:30am till 5:pm. When She came home I pretended I had just got in as well, hence justifying playing it all evening. I have since quit playing MMORPG and have a good job.\nWhen I got to the point where I was eating my dinner in front of the PC I realised things were getting silly so I'm trying not to spend so much time on there. It's not easy. I feel as if I've got a real addiction going on here.\nFor me the problem is that I love to complete a goal. Once it is completed that is it, I am finished, time to move on. I become obsessed to complete the goal, so from that standpoint it is an addiction. In a game where you will never complete an \"ultimate\" goal, well it would be like falling into a black pit. It is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the PC game are \"easier\" and more fun than the real world. Pretty scary implications if you think about it.\nI can't buy World of Warcraft as it would destroy my marrage, I just know it!!\nI played Star Wars Galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games. They are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly, but this progress becomes exponentially slower, requiring more and more time to reach the next level. I'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction I was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor, slowly building up my character, stopping only for food and toilet breaks. Thankfully I made a clean break, and actually managed to sell my Jedi account for £800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum.\nSeven years ago, I began playing Ultima Online. This game dominated 2 years of my life. They were 2 wonderful years and I still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends I had. Online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others. Something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life. Whilst I would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games, I believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching TV.\nGaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction. When I was single I used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year, building up my stats, completing evermore quests and battling ogres. But somehow I found time to get out, even met someone and got married! Has my life changed? Hell no! I still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning. On with the fun!\nOnline gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.\nMany people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families, relationships and good careers. A minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted. According to this article the same is true of MMORPGs. The message to the government is clear, either legalise drugs, or outlaw online gaming!!\nSounds like there are some sad stories here - and I can believe them all. I play alot of Warcraft myself, and know full well how addictive it is. I am resolute that it will not take over my life. It certainly gets in the way though. I think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line, or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it.\nI think I'm obsessed with gaming in general, I spend far too much time playing games like Everquest 2 and Football Manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when I do try to, I'm always thinking in the back if my mind that I'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with Cambridge United.\nI am obsessed with online role playing games. It's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc. I spend about five hours per day online playing it and I rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning...\nAs many of the players spend their time in MMORPGs rather than in front of the TV I fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively. Furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect, whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature.\nThese games are like most things -- too much of anything is a bad thing, but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too, they can be great fun.\nLiving in Korea at the moment, they have lots PC Bangs (Internet Cafes). Nearly most of South Koreans are addicted to online games, and one Korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games.\nI play xbox live every day. I find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix. The longest I played was a 24 hour straight session. I know I play for to long but it's an obsession that I can't control. Can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up... but something I'm increasingly concerned with...\nMe and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a TV, trying to 'frag' some individual. It's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming, and enjoying 'real' life...\nI bought the US version of World of Warcraft when it came out. The longest period I played was 23 hrs straight. I gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive, but have subsequently just bought the European version (couldn't help myself). In future, I'm going to regulate my time far more strictly. Great game!\nHaving played MMORPG games for some years I agree that these type of games can be life sucking. But my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment. Most MMORPG games you need a credit card to play but I dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.\nUnless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person&#191;s health, you can expect this not to decline but to get worse.\nThese people are pathetic. They need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and \"online universe\" absolutely meaningless.\n24hours, when i was a kid at school and i was on half term, Ultima Online was the game, ahhhh them was the days ! LOL",
    "A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.\nFears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a £10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.\nThere were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. \"While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,\" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be £10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.\nEven without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.\nThe report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: \"There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. \"Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. \"The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.\" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.",
    "England have named Bath prop Matt Stevens in the starting line-up for their Six Nations match against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on Sunday.\nFellow Bath prop Duncan Bell will start on the bench, as coach Andy Robinson makes just one change to the team that was beaten by France. It will be Stevens' first start after two caps as a replacement against the All Blacks last year. Leicester duo Ollie Smith and Andy Goode have been drafted onto the bench. Stevens takes over from Phil Vickery, who suffered a broken arm playing for Gloucester last weekend. \"I'm confident Matt will grasp this opportunity and make his mark against Ireland,\" said Robinson.\n\"All three players have shown outstanding form of late, most recently in the England A win against France A and for their club,\" added Robinson. \"Selection beckons when players demonstrate such consistent ability. \"This game against Ireland will be massive. We recognise it's a must-win game for us this season.\" England confirmed that Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan was not considered for selection because of an injury he picked up to the back of his ankle during last Friday's match against Leeds.\nJ Robinson (Sale Sharks, capt); M Cueto (Sale Sharks), J Noon (Newcastle), O Barkley (Bath), J Lewsey (Wasps); C Hodgson (Sale Sharks), H Ellis (Leicester); G Rowntree (Leicester), S Thompson (Northampton), M Stevens (Bath), D Grewcock (Bath), B Kay (Leicester), J Worsley (Wasps), L Moody (Leicester), M Corry (Leicester).\nA Titterrell (Sale Sharks), D Bell (Bath), S Borthwick (Bath), A Hazell (Gloucester), M Dawson (Wasps), A Goode (Leicester), O Smith (Leicester).",
    "Rangers are set to loan out-of-favour midfielder Dragan Mladenovic to Real Sociedad, despite the closure of the January transfer window.\nSociedad have been given special permission by the Spanish FA to sign a player due to an injury crisis. Mladenovic will effectively replace former Rangers midfielder Mikel Arteta, who has been loaned to Everton. Sociedad say they will pay Rangers £150,000, with an option to buy the Serbia & Montenegro international. Mladenovic's loan move is subject to him passing a medical. The 28-year-old, who joined Rangers from Red Star Belgrade for £1.2m in the close season, is expected in San Sebastian later this week following his national side's game against Bulgaria. Sociedad are in 15th place in the 20-strong Primera Liga, just two points above the relegation zone. Special permission from the Spanish FA came after an injury to central defender Igor Jauregi. The versatile Mladenovic can also play in the back four. His agent said last month that Rangers had told him to find the player a new club. Mladenovic's time at Ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the Glasgow club.",
    "Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\nLabour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\nOn Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\nUKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\nUKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.",
    "The US looks set for a continued boost to interest rates in 2005, according to the Federal Reserve.\nMinutes of the December meeting which pushed rates up to 2.25% showed that policy-makers at the Fed are worried about accelerating inflation. The clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 GMT on Wednesday, but depressed US shares. \"The markets are starting to fear a more aggressive Fed in 2005,\" said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research. The Dow Jones index dropped almost 100 points on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq also falling as key tech stocks were hit by broker downgrades. The dollar also gained ground against sterling on Tuesday, reaching $1.8832 to the pound before slipping slightly on Wednesday morning.\nThe release of the minutes just three weeks after the 14 December meeting was much faster than usual, indicating the Fed wants to keep markets more apprised of its thinking. This, too, is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come. The key Fed funds rate has risen 1.25 percentage points during 2004 from the 46-year low of 1% reached not long after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. That long trough \"might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets\", said the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates. The odds now favour a further boost to rates at the next meeting in early February, economists said. But the respite for the dollar, which spent late 2003 being pushed lower against other major currencies by worries about massive US trade and budget deficits, may be short-lived. \"You can't rule out a further correction... but we don't think it's a change in direction in the dollar,\" said Jason Daw at Merrill Lynch. \"Nothing fundamental has changed.\"",
    "The Office's Ricky Gervais is writing an episode of hit US cartoon The Simpsons, following an invitation from its creator Matt Groening.\nGervais has already begun writing the script but is keeping its subject matter a closely guarded secret. He will also write a part for himself in the episode. \"I've got the rough idea but this is the most intimidating project of my career. The Simpsons is the greatest TV show of all time,\" he said. Groening recently heaped praise on The Office, saying: \"Everybody on The Simpsons is a fan of The Office - it's one of the best shows on TV in the last decade.\" Gervais has already said he would not guest star in the show as his Office character David, having left him behind for good in the Christmas specials. The Office became a surprise US success when it was screened on cable channel BBC America. The first series won two Golden Globes in 2004 for best comedy and best TV actor for Gervais.\nIn winning it beat the likes of Sex and the City and Will and Grace. An American version was produced, but so far only a pilot has been broadcast - to much criticism that it failed to live up to the original. At the British Comedy Awards on Wednesday, Gervais was handed a special achievement award for writing. But The Office missed out in the best comedy show category to Little Britain. Matt Groening was also at the awards to collect the award for best international comedy for The Simpsons.",
    "Fans who buy tickets for this year's Glastonbury festival will be issued with photo ID cards in an attempt to beat touts, it has been confirmed.\nThe cards will include a photograph of the ticket-holder plus an electronic chip with their details to prevent tickets being sold on or forged. Tickets for the June event are expected to go on sale in April. \"There is only one place in the world where you will be able to get tickets,\" festival organiser Michael Eavis said. \"That will be the official source. If you get them anywhere else, you won't get in.\" Fans not wanting to carry the entrance card could present their passport or driving licence instead, he added.\nMore than 153,000 people are expected to travel to Mr Eavis' Somerset farm from 24-26 June, but the event's rising popularity has meant an extremely high demand for tickets in recent years. When the ID card idea was floated, Mr Eavis' daughter Emily said it would be \"quite a big step in terms of ticketing for events\" if implemented and they were \"going as far as we can\" to cut touting. \"As long as it's approached in the right way, it might really work, it might really change the system,\" she said. In 2004, all 112,000 tickets for the public sold out in 24 hours. They were personalised with the names of purchasers, who were asked to bring identification, such as a driving licence, passport or household bill. But some forgot to take the right information while some touts simply offered to supply their own bills along with the ticket bearing their name. No details of this year's line-up have been confirmed but rumours have suggested U2 and Coldplay may be among the headliners.",
    "Ireland consigned England to their third straight Six Nations defeat with a stirring victory at Lansdowne Road.\nA second-half try from captain Brian O'Driscoll and 14 points from Ronan O'Gara kept Ireland on track for their first Grand Slam since 1948. England scored first through Martin Corry but had \"tries\" from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey disallowed. Andy Robinson's men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 World Cup final. The defeat also heralded England's worst run in the championship since 1987. Ireland last won the title, then the Five Nations, in 1985, but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with Wales. And Eddie O'Sullivan's side banished the ghosts of 2003 when England were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the Grand Slam at Lansdowne Road. In front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in Dublin, Ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when O'Gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.\nEngland took their time to settle but their first real venture into Ireland's half produced a simple score for Corry. The number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the Irish line, racing 25 yards to touch down. England fly-half Charlie Hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately O'Gara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalties in quick succession. England were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes, and Hodgson, the villain at Twickenham, coolly bisected the posts. The first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking, but it was Ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. A series of probes led by the talismanic O'Driscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but Ireland chose to kick for touch.\nFrom the line-out, the ball was recycled back to O'Gara, who stroked his second drop-goal, this time off the right upright. As the interval approached, wing Josh Lewsey was the catalyst for England's most promising attack. The Wasps star raced up his touchline and Hodgson's cross-kick put in Mark Cueto for an apparent score, but the Sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. England began the second half well and had Ireland pinned in their own half. But another English indiscretion on a rare Irish break-out awarded O'Gara a kick at goal, which he missed. England's pressure continued, and a wave of attacks saw centre Jamie Noon dragged down yards from the line before Hodgson landed a drop-goal.\nThe lead was shortlived, however. Ireland raced upfield, deft handling from the backs, including a clever dummy from Geordan Murphy on Hodgson, ending with O'Driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. O'Gara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgson's cross-kick was fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line. Anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high, but O'Gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. Inside the last 10 minutes, England poured forward, spurred on by scrum-half Matt Dawson, who replaced Leicester's Harry Ellis. But despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the TV replay by referee Jonathan Kaplan - England were unable to pull off a face-saving win. Ireland next face France at Lansdowne Road in two weeks' time before the potential title decider against Wales in Cardiff.

    "Aston Villa boss David O'Leary signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension on Thursday, securing his future at the club until summer 2008.\nO'Leary's future was in question, but Villa chairman Doug Ellis said he was happy to secure the deal. \"David's record since his arrival in 2003 is excellent and he shares the board's amibitions in taking this club forward,\" he told Villa's website. \"For this reason it was important we got this right.\" O'Leary put pen to paper after deals were sorted for his right-hand men Roy Aitken and Steve McGregor. \"It was important to me Roy and Steve, an integral part of my team, should stay for the same time,\" O'Leary said on Thursday ahead of signing his new deal. \"Someone has to try and put Aston Villa back where they should belong and I'm up for the challenge.\"Earlier in December, there were rumours O'Leary would quit if he is not offered a new deal before the end of the season.\nBut he denied that, saying he was happy to take on the challenge of improving Villa's fortunes in the long term. \"I want to make sure by the end of the five years I would have been in charge that Villa are achieving top six finishes in the Premiership on a regular basis,\" said O'Leary, who took over at Villa Park in May 2003. \"But to achieve that, and take the next step forward, we do need to bring in quality players. \"I would like a couple next month if at all possible to set us on the way.\" Meanwhile, O'Leary has rapped skipper Olof Mellberg for his comments before Sunday's derby with Birmingham.\nMellberg spoke of his dislike of Villa's rivals ahead of the match, which Steve Bruce's side won 2-1. \"I've had more than a quiet word with Olof. It's been said within the whole group, not as a one-to-one,\" he told Villa's website. \"You shouldn't leave yourself open to be shot down. You shouldn't give people the chance to take cheap shots at you and he set himself up for that.\"",
    "Kim Clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of January's Australian Open because of her persistent wrist injury.\nOpen chief Paul McNamee had said: \"Kim's wrist obviously isn't going to be rehabilitated.\" But her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry. \"The doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. But if there's the least risk she will stay away.\" Despite being absent from the WTA entry list for the tournament, which begins on 17 January, Clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. Clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. The Belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. Meanwhile, Jelena Dokic, who used to compete for Australia, has opted out of the first Grand Slam of the season. Dokic has not played in the Australian Open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. But the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. Four-time champion Monica Seles, who has not played since last year's French Open, is another absentee because of an injured left foot.",
    "The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.\nPoliticians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.\nHugo Lueders, European director for public policy at CompTIA, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration.",

    "Marion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe Sydney Olympic gold medallist says Conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: \"I stand by everything I said\". Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she \"has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs\". Conte's statements, the suit added, were \"false and malicious\". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: \"Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. \"Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America's most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte's statements have been wildly contradictory. \"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.\n\"Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.\" The sport's ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte's allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte \"for further information\". But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte's television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.",
    "Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said his side's task against AC Milan would not be made any easier by the absence of Andriy Shevchenko.\nMilan's talismanic European footballer of the year misses Wednesday's Champions League first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone. \"It's a loss (to Milan), but it could be worse if they didn't have such quality to bring in,\" Ferguson said. \"How much they miss him I think they'll know tomorrow night.\" Ferguson said Milan's front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders. \"They can play Rui Costa and play Kaka forward. They can bring Serginho in and they can play (Jon Dahl) Tomasson,\" he said. Ferguson's own goalscoring talisman Ruud van Nistelrooy is fit again, but the Scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the Dutchman, who has not played for three months.\n\"Ruud is the best striker in Europe. What I have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long,\" he said. \"His ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision.\" Ferguson, though, is confident his young players, particularly Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, are up to the task. \"We have an opportunity to win this cup this year, no question about that,\" he declared. \"With the maturity we see every week in Ronaldo and Rooney, the return of Van Nistelrooy and the form of Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, we must have a fantastic chance.\" It is a view shared by Rooney, who believes \"if we can get past Milan, we have a great chance\". \"As soon as I knew we were playing Milan, I got excited. Looking at the draw, it is anyone's trophy but we have every chance. \"Hopefully, we can get to that final in Turkey and bring the cup back to Manchester.\" Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted Europe's most prestigious club title two seasons ago. Milan beat Juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at Old Trafford and Ancelotti said: \"We are all very happy to return (to Old Trafford) to play in the Champions League and this will give us great motivation.\" Ancelotti said he was aware of the threat United posed to his hopes of Champions League glory. \"It's fundamental that we don't allow them to take control of the game.

    "Georgia is offering a one-off 'tax amnesty' to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze.\nThe country's new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax. The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia's flagging economy. Georgia's black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.\nMr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era, and boost Georgia's fragile public finances.\nThe new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected. \"There are people who have money but are afraid to show it,\" the president told a government session. \"Documentation about where this money came from doesn't exist because under the former, entirely warped regime, earning capital honestly was not possible.\"\nBy declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to \"legalise their property\", Mr Saakashvili stressed.\n\"No one will have the right to check this money's origin. This money must go back into the economy.\" The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of Georgian businesses -are to continue. Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in November, of allowing bribery to flourish. Georgia's economy is in a desperate condition. Half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4, or three euros, a day.

    "The reported feud between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has prompted a Labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.\nDuncan Bannatyne also attacked the government over Iraq and its \"poor\" response to the Asian tsunami crisis. His broadside came as ex-Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he hoped Mr Brown would be premier at some point. Mr Bannatyne has previously given Labour £50,000. He made his fortune from care homes and health clubs.\nThe 52-year-old on Tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of Cabinet disunity and international issues. His spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give Labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the Conservatives.\nRobert Peston's new book has prompted more speculation about the Blair-Brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. Mr Bannatyne said: \"Disunity in the Cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country. \"Gordon Brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy, but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition.\" The businessman, whose latest venture is a casino in Newcastle, also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in Iraq.\nAnd he branded the UK government's response to the tsunami as \"piecemeal and poor\". \"The people there need practical help not just pledges of money,\" he said. \"The US has forces helping on the ground - we can do more.\" British Navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. Mr Bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on BBC2 business start-up programme Dragon's Den. But his spokesman insisted his attack on Labour was not a publicity stunt.\nIn a separate development, Robin Cook gave his support to Mr Brown's prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be Labour's election. But he insisted the recent squabbles between Mr Blair and Mr Brown were not \"perceived as a problem by the voters,\" adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. Mr Cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was \"not an alternative source of opposition to the government\". He warned the \"Abstentions Party\" was the real challenge to Labour - and they would not be motivated by Mr Blair's promise to produce an \"unremittingly New Labour\" election manifesto. His comments come after Dave Prentis, the leader of Britain's biggest union Unison, told the Daily Record newspaper he wants a date to be set for Mr Blair to be replaced as Labour leader.",
    "Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange.\nSpeaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai, he said a full listing was \"one of the options\" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium. The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.\nWhen Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time. The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing. \"When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,\" Mr Dein said.\n\"Listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. \"We want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), Manchester United have been a success.\"\nMr Dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. Since the formation of the Premier League in season 1992/93, Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. \"Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition. \"We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline, and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too. \"I think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes I think less is more.\"\nThe club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium. It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets, including Asia. \"We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs, and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too, as they are around the world. \"We have got a very good product, so it is very important we go and look at these markets, and make sure we are on the case.\"",

Mind you, every time she breaks the record she gets $30,000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes. She looked good and was very positive. Agnes Samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly. My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid. He started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.\nIt would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis-Francis could have done in the final, if only he hadn't got himself disqualified. He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. My view is you're meant to go when the gun goes and not before. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. Having said that, Mark is looking in much better shape. But I haven't seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans. From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.\nSomething else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships. Scotland's Lee McConnell is probably going to run too, so we have a real prospect of a medal. From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great. Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money. She had a go but just could not hang in there. We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape. As for Kenenisa Bekele, he was well beaten by Markos Geneti. But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season. It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.",
    "Film star Robert De Niro has returned to the top of the North American box office with his film Hide and Seek.\nThe thriller shot straight to the number one spot after taking $22m (£11.7m) at the box office. De Niro recently spent three weeks at the top with comedy Meet The Fockers, which was at number five this week. Oscar hopefuls The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Sideways all cashed in on their multiple nominations with stronger ticket sales.\nIn Hide and Seek, De Niro plays a widower whose daughter has a creepy imaginary friend. Despite lukewarm reviews from critics, the film took more than the expected $18m (£9.5m). \"The element of a real actor in a psychological thriller certainly elevated it,\" said Bruce Snyder, president of domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox. Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby led the Oscar hopefuls with $11.8m (£6.3m), coming in at number three during its first weekend of wide release. The Aviator, a film biography of Howard Hughes that leads the Oscar field with 11 nominations, was at number six for the weekend with $7.5m (£4m). Oscar best-picture nominee Sideways entered the top ten for the first time in its 15th week of release. It came in seventh $6.3 (£3.35m). Last week's top film, Ice Cube's road-trip comedy Are We There Yet?, slipped to second place with $17m (£9m), while Coach Carter fell two places to number four, taking $8m (£4.25m) in its third week. Rounding out the top ten were In Good Company - starring Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson - Racing Stripes and Assault on Precinct 13.",
    "Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini will miss Sunday's Carling Cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against Newcastle.\nThe Italian was sent off for bringing down Shola Ameobi in the final minute of Sunday's match. Blues boss Jose Mourinho had promised to pick Cudicini for the final instead of first-choice keeper Petr Cech. The 31-year-old will now serve a one-match suspension commencing with immediate effect.\nCudicini kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for Chelsea, but Petr Cech has established himself as first choice for Mourinho since moving to Stamford Bridge in summer 2004. The 22-year-old Czech Republic international has set a new Premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal, a mark which is still running. But Mourinho has used Cudicini regularly in the Carling Cup, and the Italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during Chelsea's run to the final.",
    "TV, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.\nIt is called high-definition - HD for short - and it is already hugely popular in Japan and the US. It is set, according to analysts, to do for images what CDs did for sound. Different equipment able to receive HD signals is needed though and is expensive. But Europe's gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. Europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream HDTV.\nTo view it, it needs to be transmitted in HD format, and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. The next generation of consoles, however, are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005, start of 2006. And most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures. \"In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory,\" Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website. \"Every game is going to be playable in HD. \"So consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on HDTVs, and who have no content to watch, are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures. \"It's going to change really the way they look at gaming.\"\nAt the end of last year, Chris Deering, Sony's European president, made a prediction that 20 million European households would have HDTV sets by 2008. A previous prediction from analysts Datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003. But those in Europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. Satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006 and the BBC intends to produce all of its content in HD by 2010.\nUntil broadcast rights, format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed, TV content will be limited. All TV images are made up of pixels which go across the screen, and scan lines which go down the screen. Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. HD offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. This means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard TV. \"Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this TV can do', until HD is really adopted by broadcasters,\" explains Dr Tuffy. But gamers are also the ideal target audience for HD because they always crave better quality graphics, and more immersive gaming experiences. They are used to spending money on hardware to match a game's requirements. Demographics have changed too and the \"sweet spot\" for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. This means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen, high-definition display technologies and HD projectors, earlier than others.\nHigher capacity storage discs, such as HD-DVD and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.\nFor console developers though, HD offers some production changes. It could make games production slightly more expensive, thinks Dr Tuffy. \"But we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console,\" he says. \"You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD. \"And the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game, just now they have almost got it seamless.\" With HD, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. This could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. But it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. At that point, says Dr Tuffy, games could become more or less interactive movies.",
    "Has there been a better Six Nations match than Saturday's epic in Paris?\nAnd can the Welsh revival continue all the way to a first Grand Slam since 1978? Those are the two questions occupying not just Wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in Paris. Welsh legend Mervyn Davies, a member of two of three Grand Slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as \"one of the great performances of the past three decades\". Martyn Williams, Wales' two-try scorer on the day, called it \"one of the most surreal games I have ever played in\". A crestfallen France coach, Bernard Laporte, simply observed: \"There was a French half and there was a Welsh half\". And what a half it was for the Red Dragonhood, transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. But while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure, the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this Welsh side. That they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time, then reverse it on the resumption, was remarkable enough. But in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of French pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes, Wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.\nIn international rugby, any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day, but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. England suffered some infamous Six Nations disappointments en route to World Cup glory, the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. Wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. But the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. Ten of the 22 on duty on Saturday were also involved when Wales were trounced 33-5 in Paris two years ago. But since they threw off the shackles against New Zealand in the 2003 World Cup, Wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.\n\"The confidence in the squad has been building and building since the World Cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class,\" noted coach Mike Ruddock. The likes of Michael Owen, Gethin Jenkins, Dwayne Peel and Gavin Henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer's Lions tour to New Zealand. And players like Stephen Jones, Martyn Williams, Shane Williams and Gareth Thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. Jones, after his superb man-of-the-match display, observed that \"we are a very happy camp now\". Ruddock and Thomas can take much of the credit for that, ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred Welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. The\njoie de vivre\nso evident in that magical second-half spell in Paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.\nIf England had half the innate attacking exuberance Wales have produced in this championship, they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. Similarly, Wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches, and that forward power, mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. So on to Murrayfield, where Wales have not won on their last three visits. While the hype in the Principality will go into overdrive, the players will set about the task of beating Scotland. Only then - with the visit of Ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s, and writing their own names into Welsh legend.",
    "The Conservatives have been \"a lot smarter\" in the way they have conducted the general election campaign, a Labour backbencher has said.\nDerek Wyatt said having a five month campaign \"turned off voters\" and suggested people were already \"rather bored of the thing\". He wants a greater campaigning role for Chancellor Gordon Brown. Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role. But Mr Wyatt argued: \"By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. \"So, it would be a tad foolish of the Labour Party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections.\"\nLabour's election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda. However, Mr Wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget. The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been \"trying very hard\" to improve his own standing with the electorate through a \"sort of campaign of trust\". But Mr Blair had been \"hurt\" by the Iraq controversy, he added. A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role. \"This election is a choice between Labour taking Britain forward and the Conservatives taking us back.\"",
    "Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in Parliament.\nTories, Lib Dems and some Labour MPs are poised to vote against the plans. Mr Clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. Opponents say only judges, not politicians, should be able to order detention of UK citizens. The government is expected to win Wednesday's vote in the Commons, but faces a battle in the House of Lords.\nThe Prevention of Terrorism Bill was published on Tuesday. It proposes \"control orders\", which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases, and curfews, electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.\nThe two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary, rather than a judge. Tory shadow home secretary David Davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice, like the Guildford Four - for which Tony Blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects. \"Those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that's why we have serious concerns abut that approach,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nMr Clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. He also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. The foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at London's Belmarsh prison. They are held under laws which the Law Lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 March.\nThe new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the Law Lords' concerns, would apply to British as well as foreign terror suspects. Critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive UK citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. Opposition MPs are also angry they will have only two days - Wednesday and next Monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the House of Lords. But the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently.\nIn a rare move, the Tories and Lib Dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill, saying the house arrest plans are \"excessive\". It argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan \"wrongly infringes the right to liberty\" by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. Mr Davis told Today: \"It gives a minister, for the first time in modern history, the right to detain without trial, without showing the evidence and indeed, in some respects, almost the allegation against the individual concerned.\"\nHe questioned why there was \"such a rush\" to introduce the legislation when Mr Clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"We believe it should be the judge that takes decisions, not politicians.\" Mr Clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be \"rash and negligent\" to ignore their advice. Nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the UK and its interests, he argued.",
    "A TV station in the US has refused to show a controversial new series where adopted children try and pick their birth father - and win a cash prize.\nThe WRAZ-TV Fox affiliate in North Carolina was the only one of 182 stations to refuse Monday's show. Who's Your Daddy promises $100,000 (£52,000) to the contestant if she correctly identifies her father. It was met with protests by the National Council for Adoption, which said it \"exploits\" sensitive emotions. \"It exploits the sensitive emotions of adoption,\" said Thomas Atwood, president of the National Council for Adoption. \"It trivialises them. Adoption is a very personal, meaningful experience and it should not be commercialised like this.\" On the pre-taped programme, the contestant is presented with eight men who may or may not be her natural father.\nIf she picks the correct man from the line-up, the contestant wins the jackpot prize of US$100,000 (£52,590). However, if she picks the wrong man, then the impostor takes the money. Fox producers defended the show, saying it was a \"positive experience\". They have made six specials, though only one episode has so far been broadcast.\n\"The special was thoroughly vetted by our standards and practices department to ensure that it was appropriate for broadcast,\" said a Fox spokesman. \"However, any network affiliate that feels the programming may be inappropriate for their individual market has the right to pre-empt the schedule.\" WRAZ-TV instead chose to air an independently-produced film, I Have Roots and Branches... Personal Reflections on Adoption, a documentary about families with adopted children. \"We just don't think adoption is a game show,\" said Tommy Schenck, WRAZ-TV's general manager, though he said his decision had not been influenced by public protests.",
    "Chelsea's win at Fulham - confirming their position at the Premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season.\nThey have got strength in depth, great players, an outstanding manager in Jose Mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match. All they need to add now is the big prizes which, as we all know, is the most difficult part of all. One thing is certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed. They beat a very tough Everton at Stamford Bridge, won at Newcastle in the Carling Cup, and then won 4-1 at Fulham, which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. As I said, winning the major honours is the hardest task of all, but in Mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now. Mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all, the Champions League, and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players. It is a priceless commodity. No-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by Mourinho. He is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people, and maybe he can appear that way, but he has the silverware to back up the talk. Mourinho doesn't simply talk a good game - he's won some very big games such as the Champions League final with Porto. Some may criticise his talk, but the words are backed up with actions. I've also found him to be very realistic whenever I've heard him. He's spent a lot of money and it seems to be working, and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked. The buys are now integrating, and in Arjen Robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension.\nIn the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics, and yet he was winning games. You cannot win titles early on in the season, but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital. I also thought the criticism was very harsh, because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful. Now they are taking those chances, have the double threat of Robben and Damien Duff, and things are looking good. I just wonder if they lack a predator, particularly with Didier Drogba injured. He was starting to look the part before he was sidelined, but you have to feel if Chelsea had a Ruud van Nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title. Chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the Champions League. I felt they would never have a better chance than last season, but they have swept all before them in Europe so far this season. It will now be very interesting to see how Mourinho prioritises things, but his life will be made easier by the size of Chelsea's squad. I have said I believed Chelsea would win the league this season, even when Arsenal were flying at the start, and I have seen nothing to make me change me mind.\nIf anything, what I have seen has confirmed my early impressions. And Chelsea would have taken encouragement from Arsenal's rocky defensive display at Spurs, even though they ran out 5-4 winners. Mourinho had his say on that game, complaining: \"Five-four is a hockey score, not a football score. \"In a three-against-three training match, if the score reaches 5-4 I send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly. \"So to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful.\"\nOn a more serious note, it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of Sol Campbell to Arsenal. Much criticism has been aimed at Pascal Cygan, but I believe the problem lies with the absence of Campbell and its overall effect on Arsenal's defence. Confidence is a crucial factor in defending. When you start conceding goals, you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area. You think \"oh no\" - then find your worst fears confirmed. Arsenal need to reverse the process, with or without Campbell, and get some clean sheets on the board. But the return of Campbell is key. He solidifies the unit, has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck. He is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him. Campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit. Chelsea have no such problems at present, which is why I would still place my money on them to edge out Arsenal as champions this season.",
    "Prime Minister Tony Blair purchased two copies of the charity single Band Aid 20 in Edinburgh on Friday.\nStaff were surprised when the Prime Minister walked into HMV at 0900 GMT, accompanied by aides and local police. \"When Mr Blair came in unannounced, we were all pretty gobsmacked,\" said HMV manager Clive Smith. \"Our customer helper approached him... it was only then we realised he wanted to buy copies of the Band Aid single, rather than the latest Eminem album.\" Predicted chart-topper Do They Know it's Christmas? is expected to sell at least 300,000 copies by the time the new chart is announced on Sunday. However, the new version of the 1984 single is not going to be released in the US, despite being sold in many countries around the world. US record shops are stocking an import version of Do They Know It's Christmas, which is said to be selling very well in Los Angeles and New York. The original track was released in the US, and reached number 13 in the singles chart. British stars who appear on the current recording, such as Dido and Coldplay's Chris Martin, are well-known to music fans across the Atlantic, along with U2 frontman Bono.\nRecord company Universal is responsible for the global distribution of the single, which will be available across Europe, Asia, South America and Canada. But music fans in the US are still able to access the song and download it on Band Aid 20's official website. In 1985, a group of high-profile American stars known as USA For Africa came together to record their own fund-raising single, We Are The World. The song was written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, with Quincy Jones as producer. It topped the US charts for three weeks and went on win Grammy awards for best record and song.\nDionne Warwick, Diana Ross and Tina Turner were among the line-up of performers. It is predicted that the Band Aid 20 song will sell 300,000 copies in the UK by the time the new chart is announced on Sunday. The record is also tipped to become this year's Christmas number one, as the original version did in 1984. Proceeds from the sales are going towards relief for the Darfur region of Sudan and to combat HIV and Aids across Africa.",

The News of the World reports that Anelka told a French magazine: \"I either decide to win titles or to have an easy life. \"I think I will always choose football, if a great club makes me an offer.\" He added: \"To win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so. If we stagnate between eighth and 15th place it's impossible to progress. \"If I am going to score goals and not win, there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up.\" Anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris St Germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him.\n\"I am in talks to sign an extension to my contract,\" he said. \"I am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account. \"Playing for eighth place is good but I miss the Champions League. \"I won it with Real Madrid in 2000 and I need to be playing in it - and I should be playing in it. \"I'm not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football. \"But I don't blame anyone.

    "Sir Alex Ferguson has called on the Football Association to punish Arsenal's Thierry Henry for an incident involving Gabriel Heinze.\nFerguson believes Henry deliberately caught Heinze on the head with his knee during United's controversial win. The United boss said it was worse than Ruud van Nistelrooy's foul on Ashley Cole for which he got a three-game ban. \"We shall present it to the FA and see what they do. The tackle on Heinze was terrible,\" he said. Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. The clash occurred moments before half-time when a Freddie Ljungberg challenge left Heinze on the ground on the left touchline. Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinze's head.\nThe striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental. Ferguson was also upset by Arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side's behaviour. \"Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker,\" he said. \"There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge. \"I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. \"We have always been good at being gracious in defeat. What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, don't they?\"",
    "Hollywood film star Liam Neeson has held a dinner party in New York to promote Belfast's Lyric Theatre.\nThe Ballymena-born actor said that the theatre on Ridgeway Street was in a \"very dilapidated condition\". Lyric chairman David Johnston has said that rebuilding the theatre, at a cost of £8m is the only answer. Mr Neeson said that the idea was to get a bunch of \"healthy, wealthy Irish Americans\" in one room and ask them to help with fundraising.\nThe Oscar-nominated actor, whose films include Schindler's List, Michael Collins and Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, said: \"The Lyric is too important to the cultural and social life of Northern Ireland for this building to crumble and fall apart. \"It gave me a start professionally. Mary O'Malley, the founder of the theatre, gave me my future. \"In those days, in the mid-70s, when I was there, we were doing a play every four weeks. \"Belfast was not a pretty town to be living in. \"There was serious trouble, as you know, but this theatre was like a Belisha beacon of light and hope six nights a week, doing everything from Shakespeare to Yeats to O'Casey with a group of actors and actresses that affected me very deeply and still do.\" The Lyric began 50 years ago but the doors opened at its present site on the Stranmillis embankment overlooking the River Lagan in 1968.\nAs well as Liam Neeson, it also launched the careers of Adrian Dunbar and Stephen Rea and playwrights such as Martin Lynch and Gary Mitchell. Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland before the event at New York's SoHo House, Mr Neeson said that his spirit belonged to the Glens of Antrim. And he said that there was one figure from his childhood that he would love to portray on the big screen - Ian Paisley. He said that the DUP leader and preacher was a \"very dynamic, extraordinary figure\". Neeson used to listen to his sermons on a Friday night in Ballymena. He said: \"What an orator. He was from that old school of bible-thumping righteousness. But it was so dramatic. I found him very powerful. \"I'd love to get a chance to play him some time.\"",
    "Your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future?\nGifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact.

The first vouchers, worth £250 or £500 for low-income families, will be distributed from January. All children born after 1st September 2002 will be eligible. Parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in April 2005.\nParents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.\nThere are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. Some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the Ladybird account from the Saffron Walden Building Society, paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of £1 and the Alliance & Leicester FirstSaver which pays 5.25%, also starting at £1.\nInterest earned by children is subject to income tax. However, children, like adults, have a personal income tax allowance (£4,745 for the current tax year).\nIf the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. As long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance, then no tax will be payable. When the account is opened a form \"R85\", available from the bank or building society, should be completed. This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.\nThe tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. Only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children's names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. Therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.\nAnother favourite solution is Premium Bonds. With the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account, they make great presents. The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. Any prizes will be sent to the parent or child's guardian. The minimum for each purchase is £100 and Bonds are sold in multiples of £10.\nThere are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.\nOver the longer term, stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment, although in the shorter term they can be volatile. One of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. These are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. These funds may be actively managed, where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential, or passive, where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index, for example, the FTSE 100. Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. These are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). The difference is that the charges are quite low. The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent. For larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.",
    "The International Monetary Fund is to cut its 2005 growth forecast for the German economy from 1.8% to 0.8%, the Financial Times Deutschland reported.\nThe IMF will also reduce its growth estimate for the 12-member eurozone economy from 2.2% to 1.6%, the newspaper reported. The German economy has been faltering, with unemployment levels rising to a seventy-year high of 5.2 million. Its sluggish performance continues to hamper the entire eurozone.\nThe IMF's draft World Economic Outlook - due to be published in April - would point to a marked deterioration in Germany's economy, the FT report said.\nIn September, the IMF had said that German growth for the current year would be 1.8%. The IMF has also revised eurozone forecasts, the paper said, taking into account high oil prices, the strength of the euro and weak demand in many of the world's leading economies. Europe's economic difficulties have been highlighted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which argued in a report published on Tuesday that the continent could only achieve US living standards by freeing up its labour markets. \"The eurozone does not look like it has a self-sustaining recovery,\" James Carrick, an economist with ABN Amro, told the newspaper. \"It is too dependant on the rest of the world.\"",
    "Video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom.\nWith violent titles continuing to top the charts, gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. Recent research by the London Institute of Education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom. \"Games teach life skills such as decision making, problem solving,\" said Martin Owen, at Futurelab. Mr Owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error.\nFuturelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. Most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but Liverpool-based games firm Lateral Visions saw a gap in the market. \"Learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn't see anyone else doing what we wanted to do,\" said Dr Carl Gavin, managing director of Lateral Visions. The company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. The result is Racing Academy, a massively multiplayer car racing game, which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well.\nIt is being used by Futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. \"We are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game, we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational,\" said Mr Owen. Players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. The game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs, before and after racing. Teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data, work collaboratively and review their own performances. This fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to Futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved, thinks Mr Owen.\nThe game has been trialled in two secondary schools in Bristol and feedback from students has been positive. \"Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other,\" said Ben Williamson, a researcher at Futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. Dr Gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers' need for learning outcomes and the children's desire to rise to a challenge. \"Games in the classroom need to support the teacher. It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge,\" he said. Professor Angela MacFarlane, based at Bristol University, has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms.\nUse of games in schools has been patchy she found, with Sim City proving the most popular. Traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun, she found in her research. \"It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies,\" she wrote in a paper entitled Games and Learning. 'Lite' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. This would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. Already there are games on the market, such as Civilisation and Age of Empire, that have educational elements said Mr Owen. \"Even in Grand Theft Auto it is not just the violence that engages people,\" he said. It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though.",
    "Microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine.\nThe now formally launched MSN search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in November 2003. The revamped engine indexes more pages than before, can give direct answers to factual questions, and features tools to help people create detailed queries. Microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries.\nGoogle still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query, keep up with news or search for images. But in the last year Google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals, such as Yahoo and Microsoft, and new entrants such as Amazon and Blinkx, try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves. This renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page, recipe, book, gadget, news story, image or anything else. Microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to Google. To generate its corpus of data, Microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days - more often than rivals. The Microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer.\nFor its direct answer feature, Microsoft is calling on its Encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions, facts, calculations, conversions and solutions to equations. Tony Macklin, director of product at Ask Jeeves, pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since April 2003. \"The major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search, so in many ways Microsoft is following the market,\" he said. Tools sitting alongside the MSN search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites, countries, regions or languages. Microsoft is also using so-called \"graphic equalisers\" that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up-to-date or more popular. The company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system. The test, or beta, version of the MSN search engine unveiled in November had a few teething troubles. On its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed.",
    "Rock star Ozzy Osbourne has said his family will not make any more episodes of reality TV show The Osbournes.\n\"At the end of it I didn't like having cameras around the house all the time,\" the Black Sabbath singer told reporters at the MTV Europe Awards in Rome. His wife Sharon, who also appears in the popular MTV show based on the Osbournes' family life, agreed. \"Now everybody's doing reality shows. He's done it, he's been there, he's got to do something else,\" she said.\nOzzy Osbourne said he had had enough of the work involved in making the series. \"When you watch a 25-minute episode, I've been filming all day,\" he said. Sharon Osbourne is currently appearing as a judge and mentor in ITV1 talent show The X-Factor alongside Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh.\nEarlier this year she topped a poll of the most important people in rock, for her part in guiding the career of husband Ozzy and her family. She was the driving force behind The Osbournes, which ran for three series, earning the family a reported $85m (£46m). The renewed popularity for Ozzy has seen sales of his merchandise hit the $50m (£27.2m) mark, a record for a heavy metal artist. Sales of T-shirts, accessories and action figures have rocketed since The Osbournes hit screens. At its peak, The Osbournes had a regular audience of eight million, with America's TV Guide magazine describing the series as \"a cross between The Simpsons and This Is Spinal Tap\". Osbourne himself was at a loss to explain its popularity: \"I suppose Americans get a kick out of watching a crazy Brit family like us make complete fools of ourselves every week.\"",
    "Despite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report.\nUnemployment stood at 25%, compared with 10% before the uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago. Young people are particularly hard hit with 37% out of work, compared with 14% four years ago. But 104,000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures. However, during the first half of this year, the Palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs. Last year's growth rate of 6% can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence, the report said. According to the report, Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems. The closures arranged by Israel restrict the movement of Palestinian people and goods, slowing down trade.\n\"Closures are a key factor behind today's economic crisis in the West Bank,\" said Nigel Roberts, World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza. Nearly half of all Palestinians - some 47% - live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks. The report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation. It also called on the Palestinian Authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment-friendly climate. This week Colin Powell, US Secretary of State was visiting the West Bank to stress US support for a smooth Palestinian election in January.",
    "Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the Primera Liga club for the second time in his career.\nThe decision was taken at a board meeting following the side's surprise elimination from the Uefa Cup. \"We understand, and he understands, that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate,\" said club president Juan Bautista. Former assistant Antonio Lopez will take over as the new coach. Italian Ranieri took over the Valencia job in June 2004 having been replaced at Chelsea by Jose Mourinho.\nThings began well but the Spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to Racing Santander last weekend. That defeat was then followed by a Uefa Cup exit at the hands of Steaua Bucharest. Ranieri first took charge of Valencia in 1997, guiding them to the King's Cup and helping them to qualify for the Champions League. The 54-year-old then moved to Atletico Madrid in 1999, before joining Chelsea the following year.",
    "A slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler.\nThe German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003. Mercedes-Benz's woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.\nMercedes' profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003's 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. Sales of Mercedes' brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar.\nThe carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range. Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes' position as the world's most successful luxury brand. However, DaimlerChrysler's shares fell 1.5% on the news. \"While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz,\" Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters.\nIn contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%. The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.\nOverall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. Chrysler's strong performance helped the world's fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.\n\"The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment,\" said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman. DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso. DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso. Looking forward, DaimerChrysler's profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. However, it is expecting \"significant improvements\" in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.",
    "German airline Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003.\nIn a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; £274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003. Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. It was also hit by troubles at its US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend. The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 March.",
    "A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.\nContrack International, of Arlington, Virginia, heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. Its withdrawal from the $325m (£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon's Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack's management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\nUS firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"",
    "The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says.\nJavier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other European countries. Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge. But Home Secretary Charles Clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: \"[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it. \"It would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal.\" Mr Solana's comments come the day after Sir Ian Blair, the newly-appointed Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence.\nUnder the Anti-Terrorism Crimes and Security Act 2001, foreign terror suspects can be detained in British jails without trial or charge. Several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.\nSome of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. Human Rights group Liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard, these detainees could be brought to trial. But critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services. The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance. But Mr Clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after Law Lords ruled it illegal. He has opted for a system of \"control orders\" whereby suspects, both British and foreign, can be held under house arrest or surveillance. These orders will again involve a UK opt-out of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights. While accepting that people \"have to be prepared\" for a possible terrorist attack, Mr Solana said he had \"qualms\" about the home secretary's new plans. \"We have to fight terrorism with all our means, but not so far as to change our way of life,\" he said.",

In 1995 he directed an episode of the medical drama ER and has also appeared in Alias.\nMs Mendelsohn said the production team had been trying for a while to get Tarantino to direct an episode of CSI, and added that he was a fan of the forensic drama. She said he finally agreed a few weeks ago while CSI was doing some location shooting in Las Vegas and the show's stars persuaded him. \"He knows everything there is to know about CSI, and he is into the whole mythology of CSI,\" Mendelsohn said. \"Quentin came in a couple of weeks ago. We had a story meeting with the writers. \"He had a great idea, and it was so much fun to have him in the room... we are positively giddy.\" Filming is due to start in early April and the Tarantino-directed episode will be broadcast in the US on 19 May.",
    "Leicester withstood a stunning Wasps comeback to win a pulsating Heineken Cup encounter at the Causeway Stadium.\nThe Tigers stormed 22-6 ahead within 18 minutes through tries from Lewis Moody, Geordan Murphy and Martin Corry. European champions Wasps fought back through a Josh Lewsey try and Mark van Gisbergen's boot, and they were level at 31-31 with five minutes remaining. But it was the visitors who kept their cool as Andy Goode kicked the Tigers to victory with a penalty and a drop goal. The closing moments saw desperate defence from Leicester as Wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed. Wasps pounded the line and a penalty try looked likely before referee Nigel Williams controversially blew for full-time. Fly-half Goode was the Tigers hero, kicking 22 points in total, while Leicester's overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told. Even their lack of discipline in defence - which presented the admirable Van Ginsberg with 26 points - could not undo them as they held out for a famous win.\nLawrence Dallaglio's team have now got it all to do in the quest for a quarter-final place given that two of their last three games are away - against Leicester and Biarritz. However, Wasps rugby director Warren Gatland warned his side will will not relinquish their European title without a fight. \"If we lose next week, then we are struggling,\" said Gatland. \"But we don't want to give this trophy away. We worked so hard to win it last season, we will go down fighting. \"We have got to get our scrum right next week, it is the biggest cause for concern.\" Leicester coach John Wells saluted the outstanding work of Graham Rowntree and Julian White, who were magnificent up front. \"They were the backbone of our performance today,\" said Wells. \"And to score three tries against the European champions at home was also something I am pleased about.\"\nVan Gisbergen; Lewsey, Erinle, Abbott, Voyce; King, Dawson; Dowd, Greening, Green; Shaw, Birkett; Worsley, O'Connor, Dallaglio (capt).\nReplacements: Gotting, McKenzie, Lock, Hart, Biljon, Brooks, Hoadley.\nMurphy; Rabeni, Smith, Gibson, Healey; Goode, Ellis; Rowntree, Chuter, White, M Johnson (capt), L Deacon; Moody, Back, Corry.\nReplacements (from): Buckland/Cockerill, Morris, Kay, W Johnson/B Deacon, H Tuilagi, Bemand, A Tuiliagi, Lloyd, Vesty.",
    "Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.\nLG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. The firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in January 2004, which gave control to the creditors. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card's plastic for purchases.\nLG Card's creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.\n\"Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,\" said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm's major creditors. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. It says it wants \"fair and reasonable guidelines\" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said. Analysts believe a compromise is likely. \"LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,\" said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.\nLG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. LG card's creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. \"Eventually, LG Group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,\" said Mr Kim.",
    "David McLetchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role.\nThe Scottish Conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with Tods Murray did not influence the causes he supports. But on Friday he said: \"I have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect.\" Mr McLetchie had received advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. Labour said he had \"cleverly\" not asked about paid advocacy. A Tory spokesman \"totally refuted\" any wrongdoing.\nMr McLetchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport. The MSP had been a partner for Tods Murray which has a client opposing the development. Mr McLetchie did not have a complaint made against him, but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong.\nExplaining his reason for quitting the post, Mr McLetchie said: \"I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray. \"However, I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. \"To avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of Tods Murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled, I have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. \"I am proud to have been a part of Tods Murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future.\"\nLabour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was \"very clever\" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. \"He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,\" she said. Section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings \"where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner\". However, MSPs' Code of Conduct \"recognises a wider definition\" of parliamentary proceedings, including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions.\nBut a letter from Holyrood's Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. Commenting on Mr McLetchie's decision to stand down, a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: \"This should mean Mr McLetchie doesn't breach the paid advocacy rules in future. \"However it doesn't change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past.\"\nScottish National Party Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr McLetchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. Ms Sturgeon said: \"I think this whole episode has been very damaging for Mr McLetchie and I'm sure he will be reflecting on it.\" She added that she thought that the Tories were an irrelevant party so she would not \"lose any sleep over it\". Peter Misselbrook, executive partner of Tods Murray said Mr McLetchie had been considering retirement later in the year. He added: \"David has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so.\"",
    "Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.\nFreezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the US, where stocks are low. Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since November. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that it saw no reason to cut its output.\nAlthough below last year's peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004's average of $41.48.\nBrent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close. Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. \"The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it,\" said Chris Furness, senior market strategist at 4Cast. \"If the dollar continues to weaken, oil will be obviously higher.\"\nSeveral Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. \"I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,\" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters. \"I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,\" he added. Opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market. The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year. Heavy stockpiles could help force prices lower when demand eases.",
    "Crude oil prices surged back above the $47 a barrel mark on Thursday after an energy market watchdog raised its forecasts for global demand.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) warned demand for Opec's crude in the first quarter would outstrip supply. The IEA raised its estimate of 2005 oil demand growth by 80,000 barrels a day to 84 million barrels a day. US light crude rose $1.64 to $47.10, while Brent crude in London gained $1.32 to $44.45.\nThe Paris-based IEA watchdog, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from China and other Asian countries. The fresh rally in crude prices followed gains on Wednesday which were triggered by large falls in US crude supplies following a cold spell in North America in January. The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m. On top of that, ongoing problems for beleaguered Russian oil giant Yukos have also prompted the IEA to revise its output estimates from Russia - a major non-Opec supplier. \"I think that prices are now beginning to set a new range and it looks like the $40 to $50 level,\" said energy analyst Orin Middleton of Barclays Capital.",
    "The rewards of leaving front-bench politics are shown in the latest annual register of members' interests.\nThe register shows former Tory leader William Hague earning up to £820,000 on top of his MPs' salary, much of it from speaking fees. His former shadow chancellor Michael Portillo makes up to £560,000 a year - partly because of speeches and TV work. Ex-health secretary Alan Milburn earned up to £85,000 from speeches, articles and advice while not in the Cabinet.\nMr Milburn was away from the frontbench for just more than a year between stepping down as health secretary and becoming Labour's election supremo. His declared interests include £20,000 from newspaper articles and fees of up to £35,000 for four speeches. He also commanded a salary of between £25,000 and £35,000 for being on investment company Bridgepoint Capital's European advisory committee. His time out of office will, however, have lost him his £71,433 minister's salary. Mr Hague's work outside Parliament included two one-man shows, which with other speaking fees netted him up to £480,000. He also earned up to £195,000 for a weekly column in the News of the World, and between £5,000 and £10,000 for presenting BBC'2's Have I Got News for You. Mr Hague was also paid an undisclosed amount for the newspaper serialisation of his biography of William Pitt the Younger and up to £135,00 for work as an adviser to various companies.\nFormer Defence Secretary Michael Portillo makes some of his money as a non-executive director of BAE Systems. He is to stand down as an MP at the next election. And former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was paid between £45,001 and £50,000 for the paperback edition of his book about his resignation from government. His declared income of up to £205,000 also includes payments for being a consultant to the Tote and for his regular column in the Guardian newspaper. The register also shows former Home Office Minister Ann Widdecombe declaring a £100,000 advance for her third and fourth novels. She also received up to £30,000 for acting as the Guardian's agony aunt and between £5,001 and £10,000 for appearing on ITV's Celebrity Fit Club. David Blunkett has become a paid adviser to Indepen Consulting Limited now he is not home secretary - he helps them with seminars about the relationship between government and business. He earns between £5,001and £10,000 for the work.\nTony Blair's entry confirms that King Abdullah of Jordan paid for him to fly from a holiday in Egypt to official discussions - and for a sightseeing tour to Wadi Rum. Tory leader Michael Howard's only fresh entry is a Christmas hamper from the Sultan of Brunei. He also declares a trip to Mexico last year to address executives of News International, and helicopter and private jet travel paid for by supporters. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy registered donations to his office from supporters, a free ticket to last year's Bafta awards and rent from a single-bedroom flat in London. The register only contains new information for December 2004 - but Monday saw the publication of the annual review of the register, with the year's details. The payments are shown in bands of up £5,000, making it difficult to calculate the exact earnings.",
    "Flanker Colin Charvis is unlikely to play any part in Wales' final two games of the Six Nations.\nCharvis has missed all three of Wales' victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected. \"He will not figure in the Scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game,\" said Wales physio Mark Davies. Sonny Parker is continuing to struggle with a neck injury, but Hal Luscombe should be fit for the Murrayfield trip. Centre Parker has only a \"slim chance\" of being involved against the Scots on 13 March, so Luscombe's return to fitness after missing the France match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost.\nSaid Wales assistant coach Scott Johnson: \"We're positive about Hal and hope he'll be raring to go. \"He comes back into the mix again, adds to the depth and gives us other options. \" Replacement hooker Robin McBryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in Paris last Saturday. \"We're getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how Robin's looking,\" added Johnson. \"We're hopeful but it's too early to say at this stage.\" Steve Jones from the Dragons is likely to be drafted in if McBryde fails to recover.",
    "Microsoft has given game makers a glimpse of the new Xbox 2 console.\nSome details of the Xbox's performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual Game Developers Conference in the US. Xbox frontman J. Allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second. Also all titles for the new Xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games.\nMicrosoft is saving the official unveiling of the Xbox 2, codenamed Xenon, for the E3 show in May and the device could be on shop shelves by November. However, during his keynote speech at GDC Mr Allard, who heads development of game-making tools for the console, gave a glimpse into how some of its core software will work. He said gaming was entering a \"high-definition\" era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the HDTV people were starting to watch as well as the HD DVDs that will soon start to appear.\nIndustry watchers took this to mean that the Xbox 2 will push for HDTV quality graphics as standard as well as multi-channel audio to give gamers an authentic experience. Mr Allard said Microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the Xbox 2 and for players to get playing. To this end Microsoft was building in to Xbox hardware systems to support headset chat, buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games. The Xbox would also support well-known industry specifications, such as DirectX, to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console. For gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every Xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware. This interface will hold details of a player's statistics and skill level on a \"gamer card\" as well as give access to a store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons, such as new maps or vehicles, for games they possess. This ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future, said Mr Allard. Only with such consistency would the Xbox be able to support the 10-20 million subscribers that it was aiming for, said Mr Allard. During his speech Mr Allard took several swipes at the Playstation and said processors for consoles had to be made with developers, not just engineers, in mind. \"Our approach is Bruce Lee, not brute force,\" he said.",
    "Shares in online auction house eBay fell 9.8% in after-hours trade on Wednesday, after its quarterly profits failed to meet market expectations.\nDespite seeing net profits rise by 44% to $205.4m (£110m) during October to December, from $142m a year earlier, Wall Street had expected more. EBay stock fell to $92.9 in after-hours trade, from a $103.05 end on Nasdaq. EBay's net revenue for the quarter rose to $935.8m from $648.4m, boosted by growth at its PayPal payment service.\nExcluding special items, eBay's profit was 33 cents a share, but analysts had expected 34 cents.\n\"I think Wall Street has gotten a bit ahead of eBay this quarter and for the 2005 year.\" said Janco Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen. For 2004 as a whole, eBay earned $778.2m on sales of $3.27bn. EBay president and chief executive Meg Whitman called 2004 an \"outstanding success\" that generated \"tremendous momentum\" for 2005. \"I'm more confident than ever that the decisions and investments we're making today will ensure a bright future for the company and our community of users around the world,\" she said. EBay now forecasts 2005 revenue of $4.2bn to $4.35bn and earnings excluding items of $1.48 to $1.52 per share. Analysts had previously estimated that eBay would achieve 2005 revenues of $4.37bn and earnings of $1.62 per share, excluding items.",
    "Brewing giant Inbev has agreed to buy Alfa-Eco's stake in Sun Interbrew, Russia's second-largest brewer, for up to 259.7m euros ($353.3m; £183.75m).\nAlfa-Eco, the venture capital arm of Russian conglomerate Alfa Group, has a one-fifth stake in Sun Interbrew. The deal gives Inbev, the world's biggest beermaker, near-total control over the Russian brewer. Inbev bought out another partner in August 2004. Inbev brands include Bass, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden and Staropramen. It employs 77,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.\nThe Leuven-based brewery said it would own 97.3% of the voting shares and 98.8% of the non-voting shares of Sun Interbrew. The deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. Inbev was formed in August 2004 when Belgium's Interbrew bought Brazilian brewer Ambev. Sun Interbrew, which employs 8,000 staff, owns breweries in eight Russian cities - Klin, Ivanovo, Saransk, Kursk, Volzhsky, Omsk, Perm and Novocheboksarsk. There are also three breweries in Ukraine, in the cities of Chernigov, Nikolaev and Kharkov.",
    "The £10bn Crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get the go-ahead this month, according to The Mail on Sunday.\nIt says the UK Treasury has allocated £7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly. The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast cross-London rail link. The paper says it will go before the House of Commons on 23 February.\nA second reading could follow on 16 or 17 March. \"We've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this remains the case,\" the Department for Transport said on Sunday. Jeremy de Souza, a spokesman for Crossrail, said on Sunday he could not confirm whether the Treasury was planning to invest £7.5bn or when the bill would go before Parliament.\nHowever, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election.\nThe new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of London, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City. Heathrow to the City would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube. The line has the support of the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, business groups and the government, but there have been three years of arguments over how it should be funded. The Mail on Sunday's Financial Mail said the £7.5bn of Treasury money was earmarked for spending in £2.5bn instalments in 2010, 2011 and 2012.",

Get Me Out Of Here as no evictions were made on the television show on Saturday.\nContestants Paul Burrell, Joe Pasquale, Janet Street-Porter and Fran Cosgrave were told by hosts Ant and Dec. Natalie Appleton's decision to quit the show last Monday had given them all a stay of execution, the group were told. Model Sophie Anderton was the last person to be voted off the ITV1 show, set in the Australian jungle. The four remaining stars will do a joint Bushtucker Trial on Sunday.\nFormer All Saints singer Natalie Appleton,31, walked out of the show after learning she would face a fifth so-called Bushtucker Trial. The celebrities are chosen by the viewers to pass trials in order to win food for the rest of the camp.

    "Newcastle have joined the race to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes and scupper Liverpool's bid to snap up the player, according to reports.\nLiverpool were reported to have bid £3.5m for the 28-year-old Spanish international this week. But the Liverpool Echo newspaper has said Anfield boss Rafa Benitez will avoid a bidding war and instead turn his attentions to Nicolas Anelka. Real are believed to still want £7m before selling Morientes. Monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season. Reports suggest Liverpool will lift their offer to £5m - the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal.\nOn Tuesday, Morientes had said: \"I like Liverpool and I am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me. I have told Madrid that I want it to happen. \"Madrid know my situation and they know they must do something about me. They must sort out the situation by being sensible. \"I am in a position where I want to play, and I will have to look elsewhere to do that. If Madrid do not want me then it's in the best interests of everyone that they are realistic.\n\"I haven't spoken to Rafa Benitez but I have always appreciated his work and I would like to play for him. But Benitez could yet turn his attentions to the younger Anelka should Morientes be reluctant to pledge his future to Liverpool. Anelka previously played at Anfield under Gerard Houllier before sealing his permanent switch to Manchester City.",
    "The UK's trade gap narrowed in November, helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the European Union.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the difference between what the UK exported and imported was £3.1bn ($5.8bn), down from October's £3.6bn. Overall UK exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3.2% to £24.8bn, although total imports rose again to a new record of £27.9bn. The deficit for goods alone was £4.6bn, down from October's £5bn. During November the UK exported £16.9bn worth of goods, but imported £21.5bn. The cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at £36.3bn, £4.5bn higher than the same period in 2003.\nNovember saw an improvement in export levels to both the European Union and the rest of the world, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. EU exports rose 2%, fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. Non-EU exports shot up 7.5%, with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars, consumer durables and chemicals. The export boost offset a 1% rise in imports. Non-EU imports rose 3%, but the growth in goods entering the UK from the EU slowed to 0.5%.\nThe UK's deficit with the EU fell to £1.9bn from £2.1bn, while its non-EU shortfall dropped to £2.7bn from £2.9bn in October.\nThe country's surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at £1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. Paul Dales, UK economist for Capital Economics, said the figures represented an improvement on recent months. However, he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain. \"The figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor,\" he said. \"There have been some very encouraging signs that the UK export recovery is starting to take hold. But there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent.\"",
    "Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers, who is accused of overseeing an $11bn (£5.8bn) fraud, never made accounting decisions, a witness has told jurors.\nDavid Myers made the comments under questioning by defence lawyers who have been arguing that Mr Ebbers was not responsible for Worldcom's problems. The phone company collapsed in 2002 and prosecutors claim that losses were hidden to protect the firm's shares. Mr Myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors.\nOn Monday, defence lawyer Reid Weingarten tried to distance his client from the allegations. During cross examination, he asked Mr Myers if he ever knew Mr Ebbers \"make an accounting decision?\". \"Not that I am aware of,\" Mr Myers replied. \"Did you ever know Mr Ebbers to make an accounting entry into Worldcom books?\" Mr Weingarten pressed. \"No,\" replied the witness. Mr Myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former Worldcom chief financial officer Scott Sullivan. Defence lawyers have been trying to paint Mr Sullivan, who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial, as the mastermind behind Worldcom's accounting house of cards.\nMr Ebbers' team, meanwhile, are looking to portray him as an affable boss, who by his own admission is more PE graduate than economist. Whatever his abilities, Mr Ebbers transformed Worldcom from a relative unknown into a $160bn telecoms giant and investor darling of the late 1990s. Worldcom's problems mounted, however, as competition increased and the telecoms boom petered out. When the firm finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Mr Ebbers' trial is expected to last two months and if found guilty the former CEO faces a substantial jail sentence. He has firmly declared his innocence.",
    "David Miliband's rapid rise through the ranks of government continues with his promotion to Cabinet Office minister.\nElected in a safe Labour seat in 2001 his previous job was school standards minister - a role he won in May 2002. Prior to the last election he was a key figure in New Labour as the head of the Downing Street policy unit where he was a key member of the manifesto writing team. Seen as one of the more intellectual figures in the government, he was also working for Tony Blair in his policy unit when he was leader of the opposition.\nA brief glance at Mr Miliband's family background reveals an impressive socialist pedigree in the form of his father Ralph, who died in 1994. He was an eminent and influential leftwing academic. And while David Miliband is seen as a key Blair lieutenant his brother Ed is a special advisor to Chancellor Gordon Brown. Prior to working for Mr Blair, David Miliband spent time at the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. He then became secretary of the Commission on Social Justice. The 39-year-old was educated at Haverstock Comprehensive before going on to Oxford to study politics, philosophy and economics. He also took an MSc in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
    "The US dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on Friday as concern grows about the size of the US budget deficit.\nAnalysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. The Bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. However, trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. This has amplified reactions to news, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in January.\nThe dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on Friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on Thursday. One dollar bought 102.55 yen.\nDisappointing business figures from Chicago triggered the US currency's weakness on Thursday. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2, a bigger fall than expected. \"There are no dollar buyers now, especially after the Chicago data yesterday,\" said ABN Amro's Paul Mackel. At the same time, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was \"absolutely worrying\" for Italian exports. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. Investors will now look towards February's meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised nations in London for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar's decline.",

But it is believed that Glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move. He will still need the approval of major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who own 28.9% of the club to succeed. But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake, while fans remain opposed to his involvement.",

We are top of the league by nine points and in the Carling Cup final. \"The only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the FA Cup. \"In the Champions League all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still Chelsea.\"\nMourinho said it was important to keep his team's results in perspective. \"Don't try to put pressure on me because I am never under pressure,\" he warned. \"We have lost one important game this week - at Newcastle - and we're out of the FA Cup but I don't think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat.

    "India has signed a $40bn (£21bn) deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas from Iran.\nFirms led by the Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will also assist in the development of Iranian oil fields. Ministers, eager to gain access to energy supplies to meet the demands of a booming economy, secured a similar deal to one between Iran and China. The announcement comes as ONGC said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled Russian oil firm Yukos. The agreements with Iran were sealed after talks in New Delhi between Middle East producers and Asia's biggest energy consumers - China, India, Japan and South Korea.\nIran - Opec's second-biggest oil producer and one of the world's top gas producers - has been pursuing a series of deals, rewarding LNG buyers with participation in development of its oil fields. Under the agreement, it will supply India with 7.5 million tonnes of LPG annually over a 25 year period from 2009. ONGC and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) reached a preliminary deal for Indian firms to take part in the development of the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, both countries said in a statement. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. Consumption has jumped to 2.4 million barrels per day, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.",
    "An ex-chief financial officer at Boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $250,000 (£131,961) for illegally hiring a top Air Force aide.\nMichael Sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting Darleen Druyun while she still handled military contracts. Ms Druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. Boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a Pentagon inquiry into the case. The contract, to provide refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, was cancelled last year.\nThe Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by Ms Druyun's role in the procurement process. Boeing sacked Mr Sears and Ms Druyun in November 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. Ms Druyun had talks with Mr Sears in October 2002 about working for Boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the Pentagon. She subsequently joined the company in January 2003. Ms Druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to Boeing and other favoured companies.\nIn documents filed in a Virginia court ahead of Mr Sears' sentencing, prosecutors blamed Boeing's senior management for failing to ask key questions about the \"legal and ethical issues\" surrounding Ms Druyun's appointment. Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with Boeing. However, analysts believe Boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. The Pentagon has investigated 400 contracts, dating back to 1993, since the allegations against Ms Druyun came to light.\nBoeing's corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. Boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. The Pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to Boeing and prohibited the Seattle-based company from future rocket work.",
    "Kraft plans to cut back on advertising of products like Oreo cookies and sugary Kool-Aid drinks as part of an effort to promote healthy eating.\nThe largest US food maker will also add a label to its more nutritional and low-fat brands to promote the benefits. Kraft rival PepsiCo began a similar labelling initiative last year. The moves come as the firms face criticism from consumer groups concerned at rising levels of obesity in US children. Major food manufacturers have recently been reformulating the content of some calorie-heavy products.\nKraft's new advertising policy, which covers advertising on TV, radio and in print publications, is aimed at children between the ages of six and 11. It means commercials for some of its most famous snacks and cereals shown during early morning cartoon shows on TV will now be replaced by food and drink qualifying for Kraft's new \"Sensible Solution\" label. But the firm said it would continue to advertise all its products in media seen by parents and \"all family\" audiences. \"We're working on ways to encourage both adults and children to eat wisely by selecting more nutritionally balanced diets,\" said Lance Friedmann, Kraft senior vice president.",
    "The Tories say ministers must respond in Parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the Iraq war was drawn up at Number 10.\nDowning Street has denied the claims, made in a new book about the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's advice. Lord Goldsmith also denied them, saying he was not \"leaned on\" in any way. But the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.\nThe government has consistently refused to publish Lord Goldsmith's advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.\nBut a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. It said it was \"plain\" Iraq continued to be in material breach of UN resolution 1441. In his new book, Lawless World, Philippe Sands, a QC and international law professor, suggests the parliamentary answer was written in Downing Street. According to Mr Sands, Lord Goldsmith had warned Tony Blair in a document on 7 March 2003 that the use of force against Iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.\nMr Sands told Newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case, in case legal action was taken against the UK over the war. On 10 March, military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. The book, being serialised in the Guardian newspaper, says on 13 March Lord Goldsmith met then Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan. \"After that Downing Street proceeded to set out his [Lord Goldsmith's] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 March,\" said Mr Sands.\nTory leader Michael Howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General, warning: \"This issue will not go away.\" \"These revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates - even on an issue as important as peace and war. \"The government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust.\" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell repeated his party's calls for Lord Goldsmith's first piece of legal advice to be made public. \"The public interest, which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice, can only be served now by the fullest disclosure.\"\nIn a statement to Newsnight, Lord Goldsmith said: \"In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions. \"It was certainly not a view that I expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way, nor as I have already made clear, was it written by or at Number 10.\" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected the claims, saying: \"The attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his.\" But ex-foreign secretary Robin Cook says all the advice should now be published. He said the claims suggested Parliament had only received a pr&#233;cis of Lord Goldsmith's second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in No 10. This would be wrong even if Lord Goldsmith had signed the statement, Mr Cook said, because the attorney general's advice should be an \"independent legal opinion\", not subject to \"political negotiation of this kind\".",
    "Deutsche Boerse bosses have held \"constructive, professional and friendly\" talks with the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its chief has said.\nWerner Seifert met LSE chief executive Clara Furse amid rumours the German group may raise its bid to £1.5bn ($2.9bn) from its initial £1.3bn offer. However, rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. The Paris-based exchange, owner of Liffe in London, is reported to be ready to raise £1.4bn to fund a bid.\nThe news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE since its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London exchange for undervaluing the business. However, the LSE did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \"significantly-improved proposal\" would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. However, neither side has made a formal offer for the LSE, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away.\nDeutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. Among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by Mr Seifert with Ms Furse were plans to move the management of its cash and Eurex derivatives market to London, as well as two members of its executive board. But, Hans Reckers, a board member of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt, something Deutsche Boerse could move to the UK. \"It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt. This has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants,\" he said. Local government officials in Frankfurt's state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move. \"It is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain Frankfurt's standing as the number one financial centre in continental Europe,\" Alois Rhiel, its minister for economic affairs added.",
    "Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm Guidant for $25.4bn (£13bn).\nGuidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. Analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting Johnson & Johnson's reliance on a slowing drug business. They also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. A number of Johnson & Johnson's products are facing patent expirations, while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. Meanwhile, demand for defibrillators, which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected, is expected to increase, analysts said. The move by Johnson & Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each Guidant share, 6% more than Wednesday's closing price. Analysts say that US antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. Stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.",
    "Interactive posters are helping Londoners get around the city during the festive season.\nWhen interrogated with a mobile phone, the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home. Sited at busy underground stations, the posters are fitted with an infra-red port that can beam information directly to a handset. The posters are part of Transport for London's Safe Travel at Night campaign.\nThe campaign is intended to help Londoners, especially women, avoid trouble on the way home. In particular it aims to cut the number of sexual assaults by drivers of unlicensed minicabs. Nigel Marson, head of group marketing at Transport for London (TfL), said the posters were useful because they work outside the mobile phone networks. \"They can work in previously inaccessible areas such as underground stations which is obviously a huge advantage in a campaign of this sort,\" he said.\nThe posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an IR port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster. \"We started with infra-red because there are a huge number IR phones out there,\" said Rachel Harker, spokeswoman for Hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters. \"It's a well established technology.\" Hypertag is also now making a poster that uses short-range Bluetooth radio technology to swap data. Although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number, Ms Harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images, ring tones and video clips. She said that there are no figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign run for a cosmetics firm racked up 12,500 interactions. \"Before we ran a campaign there was a big question mark of: 'If we build it will they come?'\" she said. \"Now we know that, yes, they will.\" The TfL campaign using the posters will run until Boxing Day.",
    "A study of the United States at war in the past 50 years has picked up one of the main awards at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival in Utah, in the US.\nWhy We Fight scooped the grand jury prize for documentaries at the world's leading independent film festival. British director Sean McAllister's The Liberace of Baghdad - about a pianist in war-torn Iraq - won a special prize in the world documentary category. Both Why We Fight and The Liberace of Baghdad were made for the BBC. Why We Fight is due to be screened on BBC Four in March.\nThe Sundance festival was founded by actor Robert Redford in 1981. This year's festival - which ended on Sunday after a 11-day run - has been dominated by the themes of war and politics. In the new world cinema drama category, the Angolan film The Hero triumphed to win the grand jury prize. The film - an Angolan/French/Portuguese production - tells the story of a veteran of the country's civil war who returns home to face a new battle of survival. Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focused on countries and people under siege.\nFinnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya and Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire tells the story of a UN mission to Rwanda during the 1994 genocide. But it was Dutch documentary Shape of the Moon - a study of an extended family in Indonesia - which took the top prize. Meanwhile, French-Israeli production Wall, which looks at Israel's controversial security wall separating it from the Palestinian territories, picked up a world cinema special jury prize for documentaries. In the main drama category, Forty Shades of Blue was named winner of the grand jury prize. The film tells the tale of a forbidden tug-of-love between a father, his Russian immigrant girlfriend and his son.\nDuring its 24-year history, the Sundance Film Festival has showcased successes such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project and The Full Monty. Last year's festival provided a platform for hits such as Open Water, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and Super-Size Me. The festival is held in the mountain resort of Park City, east of Salt Lake City, which sees its population rise from 7,500 to 45,000 during the festival.",
    "Now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for TV is being prepared for our sets.\nIn most corners of TV and technology industries, high-definition (HDTV) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour. HD essentially makes TV picture quality at least four times better than now. But there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about HD on the High Street. Thousands of flat panel screens - LCDs (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV sets - have already been sold as \"HD\", but are in fact not able to display HD.\n\"The UK is the largest display market in Europe,\" according to John Binks, director of GfK, which monitors global consumer markets.\nBut, he added: \"Of all the flat panel screens sold, just 1.3% in the UK are capable of getting high-definition.\" There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra. They may be fantastic quality TVs, but many do not have adaptors in them - called DVI or HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. Part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the High Street, say industry experts, who gathered at Bafta in London for the 2nd European HDTV Summit last week. \"We have to be careful about consumer confusion. There is a massive education process to go through,\" said Mr Binks. The industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it. Eventually, that will be everyone. The BBC is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010.\nPreparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas, and programmes are being filmed with HD cameras. BSkyB plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes, to receive HDTV broadcasts, in time for Christmas. Like its Sky+ boxes, they will also be personal video recorders (PVRs). The company will start broadcasts of HDTV programmes, offering them as \"premium channel packages\", concentrating, to start with, on sports, big events, and films, in early 2006. But the set-top box which receives HDTV broadcasts has to plug into a display - TV set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that HD demands, if HDTV is to be \"real\". By 2010, 20% of homes in the UK will have some sort of TV set or display that can show HD in its full glory.\nBut it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to \"being digital\". As a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a HD forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other. Part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection. But it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for.\nFrom next month, all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a \"HD-Ready\" sticker. This also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. \"The logo is absolutely the way forward,\" said David Mercer, analysts with Strategy Analytics. \"But it is still not appearing on many retail products.\" The industry is upbeat that the sticker will help, but it is only a start. \"We can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers,\" said Mr Oudendijk. \"There may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months.\" The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is testing different flavours of HD formats to prepare for even better HDTV further down the line. It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, as well as which devices will support the formats. \"We believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile,\" said Phil Laven, technical director for the EBU. The TV display manufacturers want us to watch HD on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the \"true impact\" of HD, they say, although smaller displays suffice. What may convince people to spend money on HD-ready devices is the falling prices, which continue to tumble across Europe. The prices are dropping an average of 20% every year, according to analysts. LCD prices dropped by 43% in Europe as a whole last year, according to Mr Oudendijk.",
    "Sir Joshua Reynolds' Portrait of Omai will get a public airing following fears it would stay hidden because of an export wrangle.\nThe Tate Gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the UK. The 18th Century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition. The exhibition of Reynolds' work will be shown at Tate Britain from May. Joshua Reynolds: The Creation of Celebrity will feature prints, caricatures, and sculpture by the 18th Century artist, who painted some of the most famous personalities of his day. Portrait of Omai fetched the second highest amount for a British painting when it was sold at auction for £10.3m in 2001. It was bought by a London dealer who sold it on to a collector. The unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country, but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance.\nIn March 2004, the Tate managed to raise £12.5m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since. The portrait is of a young man who was dubbed \"the noble savage\" when he arrived in London from Polynesia. He became a darling of London society and was invited to all the best parties by people who were fascinated by such an exotic character. Sir Joshua painted him after his arrival in 1774, and it became the artist's most famous work after it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1776.",
    "Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.\nJohn Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be \"made available to law-abiding members of the community\" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The document reportedly said: \"We're looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. \"The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do.\" Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate. He told BBC News: \"He appears to have said these things. We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. \"By all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. \"It is simply a distraction from the task in hand, the EU constitution, not individual idiocies.\" Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: \"I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway.\"\nPeter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night. \"He will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.\" He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party. He added: \"I can't comment too much at the moment, I have one version from him but I haven't seen the papers yet.\"",
    "Celtic brushed aside Clyde to secure their place in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half.\nThe home side's Craig Bryson had a goal chopped off before Stan Varga headed Celtic into the lead. Alan Thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Shaun Maloney had been fouled. Stilian Petrov slid in a third, Varga tapped in his second and Craig Bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. Bryn Halliwell was the busier keeper early on, saving from Bellamy, Chris Sutton and Juninho. Clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from Bryson, but the referee had already blown for a foul by Petrov. From the resulting free kick, Darren Sheridan curled the ball round the Celtic wall only for the post to deny him. Back at the other end, Halliwell did well to come off his line and block Bellamy's effort to lift the ball over him. The keeper misjudged a corner that Stephane Henchoz headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. The ball was delivered from the left and Halliwell was left floundering as Varga glanced the ball into the net.\nMaloney replaced the injured Sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. The young striker fired a free kick straight into the Clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by Bryson and Thompson converted the penalty. Sheridan and Bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. Juninho brought out another good save from Halliwell and then Petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. But Petrov and Juninho combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past Halliwell from 12 yards. Varga got his second goal of the game as Celtic drove home their advantage - Thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and Bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving Aiden McGeady, Jackie McNamara and Maloney culminated in the Welshman hammering the ball into the net. Halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a McGeady shot wide as the game petered out.\nHalliwell, Mensing, Bollan, Balmer, Potter, Sheridan (Burns 61), Arbuckle (Gilhaney 61), Gibson, Bryson (Jones 78), Malone, Harty.\nMorrison, Wilson.\nMensing, Sheridan.\nDouglas, Henchoz, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Juninho Paulista, Thompson, Lennon (Lambert 70), Sutton (Maloney 45), Petrov (McGeady 70), Bellamy.\nMarshall, Laursen.\nThompson, Bellamy.\n: Varga 40, Thompson 48 pen, Petrov 60, Varga 68, Bellamy 72.\n8,200\nC Thomson",
    "Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby beat Martin Scorsese's The Aviator to the top awards at the Oscars on Sunday.\nThe boxing drama was named best picture and Eastwood pipped Scorsese to best director, while its stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won acting awards. The Aviator took five prizes including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett. The biopic of Howard Hughes led the nominations with 11. Jamie Foxx picked up best actor for playing soul star Ray Charles in Ray. Many expected this to be Scorsese's year - but he was unsuccessful in the best director category for the fifth time in his career.\nHe has never won despite being nominated for such films as Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Instead, Eastwood took his second Oscar for best director after winning for Unforgiven in 1993. \"It was a wonderful adventure,\" Eastwood said. \"To make a picture in 37 days, it takes a well oiled machine. I am lucky to be here and lucky to be still working. I've got a lot of stuff to do yet.\" Hilary Swank picked up her second best actress Oscar for playing a female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, beating stars including Annette Bening, Kate Winslet and Imelda Staunton. \"I don't know what I did in this life to deserve this,\" she told the audience. \"I'm just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream.\" Morgan Freeman beat actors including Clive Owen, Jamie Foxx and Alan Alda to the prize for best supporting actor. He thanked Eastwood and described the film as \"a labour of love\". This was the fourth nomination of his career but his first win. Backstage, he said: \"A lot of people say you're due - maybe you are, maybe you aren't - it's an accolade.\" Million Dollar Baby's success was the night's biggest surprise after The Aviator seemed to have the advantage until the end of the ceremony.\nCate Blanchett, who won for playing late screen legend Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, said her award was \"an indescribable surprise and honour\". Of Hepburn, she said: \"The longevity of her career is inspiring to everyone.\" Blanchett also paid tribute to the film's director Martin Scorsese, telling him: \"I hope my son will marry your daughter.\" The Aviator's other awards came for cinematography, film editing, art direction and costume design. And Jamie Foxx, who had two nominations this year, paid tribute to the \"beautiful legacy\" of soul legend Ray Charles, who died last year, and thanked director Taylor Hackford. \"You took a chance, man,\" he said. \"That love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. \"Everybody's drowning in this love. Thank you for taking a chance and thank you for waiting 15 years to get me to do it.\"\nHe broke down in tears when speaking about being whipped by his grandmother, whom he described as his first acting teacher, when he was young. In other awards, cartoon hit The Incredibles won best animated feature and best sound editing. Bittersweet comedy Sideways won best adapted screenplay while the original screenplay prize went to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Born into Brothels, about the children of prostitutes in Calcutta, was named best documentary, The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film and Finding Neverland got the accolade for best musical score. Spider-Man 2 triumphed in the visual effects category, Ray won best sound mixing and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events picked up best make-up. Former British TV presenter Andrea Arnold, who hosted children's shows Motormouth and Number 73 in the 1980s, won best short film for Wasp. Comedian Chris Rock, who hosted the ceremony for the first time, received a standing ovation before getting the show under way.",
    "Sri Lanka's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.\nPresident Kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from Sri Lanka's economic growth this year. It estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5% of the economy.\nSeparately, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in Sri Lanka and Indonesia alone. It called for action to create jobs. President Kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of Hambantota. She was joined by government and opposition politicians, together with Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian clergy.\nPrime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6,000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. Mrs Kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be \"the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation\". \"We are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. Instead we have been squabbling, fighting,\" she added. Norway's peace negotiator Erik Solheim is due to arrive on Wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the Tamil Tigers, who want a separate state in the north east of the country. Reconstruction efforts in eastern Sri Lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.\nThe IMF said that the Sri Lankan authorities' initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn, but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this. \"The broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage,\" the IMF said. Growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs. \"The fishing industry has been devastated, agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer, especially in the short term,\" the report said. The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries. Earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. Economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast. Inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. Although major exports have not suffered, the IMF expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves may become strained as \"Sri Lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level\" which totalled more than two months worth of imports. Last week, the IMF approved Sri Lanka's request for a freeze on loan repayments.",
    "Carlos Moya became the first man to successfully defend the Chennai Open title by beating four-times finalist Paradorn Srichaphan 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7/5).\nThe Spaniard then donated his £28,000 prize money to relief efforts for the victims of the Asian tsunami. The final was close throughout, with Thai second seed Srichaphan - the 2003 winner - closing out the first set. But Moya took the second set, before bouncing back from 5-2 down in the decider to force and win a tie-break. Moya confirmed afterwards: \"I'm donating my prize money from this tournament for the tsunami victims, hoping it makes some difference to their lives. His contribution follows pledges by four other players to donate their prize money from the tournament, which went ahead after the 26 December disaster which has so far claimed at least 150,000 lives. Scrichapan said he would donate an unspecified amount for relief work in Thailand, where more than 5,000 people were killed. The ATP has announced that it would contribute the US$25,000 tournament fee to Unicef's emergency relief fund in Tamil Nadu. The ATP Tour's sponsor, Mercedes, said it would also contribute, increasing the ATP donation to US$40,000.",
    "A mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful.\nThe specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video. Currently, rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. The technology, OMAP-Vox, is being tested by firms in Europe and Asia and could appear by the end of the year. Texas, which makes computer chips for more than half the world's mobile phones, said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable. \"We're going to drive them down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share,\" said Doug Rasor, a marketing vice president at Texas. The chip also uses much less power than conventional chips, said Texas, which means less strain on mobile battery life.\nMore than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK, but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. Texas is keen to cash in on the third generation (3G) of mobile technology, which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. But it faces stiff competition from the likes of Intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles.\nCompetition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK's operators have now launched third generation networks. A recent survey by Sony Ericsson predicted that the number of 3G handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold. Many consumers are still to be convinced though. A further recent survey said that only 4% of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3G phones. Many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard.\nBut there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. Earlier in January, NTT DoCoMo and Vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks, known as \"super 3G\", intended to be 10 times faster than 3G services. The first stage of development is to be completed by 2007, but no date has been set for a commercial launch The newly-designed OMAP-Vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference, 3GSM, which takes place in Cannes, France this week.",
    "Net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites\nInternet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail. Lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out. The net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool, spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data.\n\"We've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do,\" said Malte Pollmann, spokesman for Lycos Europe. \"In the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users,\" he said, \"but now we are going to go one step further.\"\n\"We've found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers.\" By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver, Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity. Mr Pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with. He said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web. \"Every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day,\" he said, \"about one MP3 file.\" But, he said, if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. Lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back, said Mr Pollmann. \"That would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing,\" he said.\nThe sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer.\nTypically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e-mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day. The list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as Spamcop. To limit the chance of mistakes being made, Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods. As these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said Mr Pollmann. Sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. Early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85%. Users do not have to be registered users of Lycos to download and use the screensaver. While working, the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data. The screensaver is due to be launched across Europe on 1 December and before now has only been trialled in Sweden. Despite the soft launch, Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days. \"There's a huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more,\" he said \"Before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive.\"",
    "The International Rugby Board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.\nIt may have to go the whole way and have NFL-style video cameras all over the field, or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. What the IRB does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. Sunday's explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road was a good example as Ireland took another step towards their first Grand Slam since 1948. The game was as exciting as it comes, with a much-improved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. One can understand that frustration. There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory, but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sport's \"blazers\". Referee Jonathan Kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. I doubt whether Kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. After all, he has no public recourse to criticism.\nIt was the same for Simon McDowell, the touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France. As far as England were concerned, there were queries over Mark Cueto's first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a Charlie Hodgson kick.\nEngland coach Andy Robinson referred to a similar case at Ravenhill in January when Ulster were playing Gloucester in the Heineken Cup. On that occasion, David Humphreys kicked to Tommy Bowe, who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. But you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. Perhaps Robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey was driven over the Irish line near the end.\nLewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. However, one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. But in rugby, everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. The referee also missed England's Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan O'Gara off the ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to the line. Those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes.\nBut there were many more, and one should not take away from those. Brian O'Driscoll's winning try was as well-conceived as they come, while Charlie Hodgson's brilliant kicking display was another highlight. And Ronan O'Gara's tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. But the defining moments came with Ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on. The first was Denis Hickie's brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. He gobbled up Cueto from another Hodgson cross-field kick, then regained his feet to stop Lewsey from scoring a certain try. Ireland's second-row colossus Paul O'Connell was equally superb. England had turned Ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. England prop Matt Stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. Unfortunately he ran into O'Connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. That spoke volumes about Ireland's back-foot display, with defensive coach Mike Ford taking a bow at the end. To win a game like that showed that Ireland have moved forward. It may be tries that win games, but it is defence that wins championships.",
    "General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.\nThe car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.\nGM's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. But the group's new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM's cuts.\nNeither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment's leaders do not agree.\nGM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.\nBringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. \"We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,\" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was \"stupid\", he said.\nIn a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change \"customers' perceptions\" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.",
    "Internet TV has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now.\nBut any early attempts to do it - the UK's Home Choice started in 1992 - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network. Now that broadband networks are bedding down, and it is becoming essential for millions, the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line. In the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls, they are keen to be the top IPTV dogs. Software giant Microsoft thinks IPTV - Internet Protocol TV - is the future of television, and it sits neatly with its vision of the \"connected entertainment experience\". \"Telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time,\" Ed Graczyk, director of marketing for Microsoft IPTV, told the BBC News website. \"The challenge has been the broadband network, and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution. \"Compression technology was not efficient enough, the net was not good enough. A lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality.\"\nLast year, he said, was all about deal making and partnering up; shaping the \"IPTV ecosystem\". This year, those deals will start to play out and more services will come online. \"2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in South America, and other parts of Asia, it will expand,\" he added. What telcos really want to do is to send the \"triple-play\" of video, voice, and data down one single line, be it cable or DSL (Digital Subscriber Line). Some are talking about \"quadruple play\", too, with mobile services added into the mix. It is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators. According to technology analysts, TDG Research, there will be 20 million subscribers to IPTV services in under six years.\nKey to the appeal of sending TV programmes down the same line as the web data, whenever a viewer wants it, is that it uses the same technology as the internet. It means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the \"broadcaster\". This allows for more DVD-like interactivity, limitless storage and broadcast space, bespoke channel \"playlists\", and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer's fingertips. It potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller, niche or localised audiences, sending films to Bollywood fans for instance, as well as individual devices.\nOperators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer, bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver. Perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking. Currently, there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite, cable or Freeview. With IPTV, the speed is 15 milliseconds. \"That gets rounds of applause,\" according to Mr Graczyk. Microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about IPTV some time ago. \"We believe this will be the way all TV is delivered in the future - but that is several years away,\" said Mr Graczyk. \"As with music, TV has moved to digital formats. \"The things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the TV, to the mobile, to the gaming console and so on.\" The company intends its Microsoft's IPTV Edition software, an end-to-end management and delivery platform, to let telcos to do exactly that, seamlessly. It has netted seven major telcos as customers, representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers. Its deal with US telco SBC was the largest TV software deal to date, said Mr Graczyk.\nIPTV is about more than telcos, though. There are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net's power. Jeremy Allaire, chief of Brightcove, told the BBC News website that it would be a flavour of IPTV that was about harnessing the web as a \"channel\".\n\"It is not just niches, but about exploiting content not usually viewed,\" he said. \"We are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content, and who often see unencumbered distribution. \"For them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive,\" he said. This type of IPTV service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives, for instance. What is a clear sign that IPTV has a future is that Microsoft is not the only player in the field. There are a lot of other \"middleware\" players providing similar management services as Microsoft, like Myrio and C-Cor. But it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful.",
    "Larne's teenage star Robbie Weir is poised to join Sunderland after turning down a move to Stoke City.\nThe 17-year-old Irish League midfielder was also being chased by Rangers and Fulham, but Mick McCarthy's side appear to have won the race. But Larne boss Jimmy McGeough has yet to confirm that Weir is on his way from Inver Park. \"I heard on Sunday that he has joined Sunderland, but not from the lad himself,\" he said. ''Robbie has an agreement with Larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs.\n''Personally, I would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the full-time game. ''He has been on trial with a number of clubs. But it would be great to see him making it at Sunderland.''",
    "Conservative leader Michael Howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall.\nMr Howard said his time at Jack's Snooker Hall in Llanelli in the 1950s had not done him \"any lasting damage\". But he told the Times Educational Supplement that truancy was \"very bad\" and said \"firm action\" was needed. Mr Howard also called for a return to O-levels and more classroom discipline.\nMr Howard eventually left Llanelli Grammar School - and the snooker hall - to go to Cambridge University. He said: \"I don't think it's done me any lasting damage. Nor has it made me a snooker world champion. \"There might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon.\n\"I'm just being honest. I think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it.\" Another player who has failed to win snooker's world championship - Jimmy \"the Whirlwind \" White - has previously admitted missing lessons, instead spending his days in smoky halls. \"Tony Meo [another player] and me used to spend all of our spare time there,\" Mr White said, \"We loved the game and the atmosphere. \"School went out of the window. I went for a while and then started taking time off.\" Mr Howard's fellow Welshman Ray Reardon - known by his fellow professionals as \"Dracula\" - won the snooker world championship six times, having left school at 14 to work as a miner. And Terry Griffiths, like Mr Howard from Llanelli, won the tournament in 1979. It is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at Jack's.",
    "Maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.\nIt would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.",
    "Labour MPs have angrily criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men.\nA meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise Labour's election hopes. The PM insisted nothing would derail Labour's campaign, despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside. Mr Brown will again be in the public eye at the party's new poster launch. In what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity, he is due to line up alongside Alan Milburn - the man controversially appointed as the party's election supremo - and deputy leader John Prescott for the event in London on Tuesday. Relations between Mr Brown and Mr Milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since Mr Blair brought the latter back into the Cabinet to run Labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by Mr Brown in both 1997 and 2001.\nMr Blair told the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\"\nThe prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the PLP and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. New speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in Brown's Britain, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, which suggested Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown. Labour's Paul Flynn said Mr Blair and Mr Brown had a \"scorching\" from MPs adding: \"It was a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting like no other.\"\nBackbencher Stephen Pound said some MPs had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if Mr Blair and Mr Brown did not \"stop this nonsense, this poisonous briefing\". Lord Campbell-Savours, a former MP, challenged Mr Brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said. Mr Prescott said MPs were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports.\n\"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today on Tuesday. Mr Prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government. But he argued Mr Blair and Mr Brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services.\nThe new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. He had then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from Cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked. Mr Blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while Mr Brown says he will not let \"gossip\" distract him from helping a unified election campaign. The Conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the Liberal Democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government.",
    "Yukos will return to a US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.\nYukos has said it will sue Baikal and others involved in the sale of Yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to have Baikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored a US court order last week blocking the sale. Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear.\nRussian newspapers have claimed that Baikal - which bought the Yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) on Sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with Surgutneftegas, Russia's fourth-biggest oil producer. Many observers believe that the unit, which produces 60% of Yukos' oil output, could ultimately fall into the hands of Surgutneftegas or even Gazprom, the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.\nThe Russian government forced the sale of Yukos' most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. Yukos' US lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of US bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. On Wednesday, Yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group. \"We believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us,\" Yukos spokesman Mike Lake told Agence France Press. \"If it exports that oil, it will be marketing a stolen product,\" he added. The future ownership of Yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that Baikal was established as a front for other interests.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, President Putin said Baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other Russian energy firms interested in the development of Yuganskneftegas. President Putin also suggested that China's National Petroleum Corporation could play a role in the unit's future after signing a commercial agreement with Gazprom to work on joint energy projects. Yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company. Commentators and Yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a government campaign to destroy it because of the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.",
    "Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.\nThe Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be \"limited\". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and \"add-ons\" that the software giant offers.\nPeople who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.\nMicrosoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. \"It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,\" he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. \"China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,\" said Mr Cluley.",
    "The classic film It's A Wonderful Life is to be turned into a musical by the producer of the controversial hit show Jerry Springer - The Opera.\nFrank Capra's 1946 movie starring James Stewart, is being turned into a £7m musical by producer Jon Thoday. He is working with Steve Brown, who wrote the award-winning musical Spend Spend Spend. A spokeswoman said the plans were in the \"very early stages\", with no cast, opening date or theatre announced.\nA series of workshops have been held in London, and on Wednesday a cast of singers unveiled the musical to a select group of potential investors. Mr Thoday said the idea of turning the film into a musical had been an ambition of his for almost 20 years. It's a Wonderful Life was based on a short story, The Greatest Gift, by Philip van Doren Stern. Mr Thoday managed to buy the rights to the story from Van Doren Stern's family in 1999, following Mr Brown's success with Spend Spend Spend. He later secured the film rights from Paramount, enabling them to use the title It's A Wonderful Life.",
    "Japanese electronics firm Hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called Emiew, to challenge Honda's Asimo and Sony's Qrio robots.\nHitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) Emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet. Two wheel-based Emiews, Pal and Chum, introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in Japan. The robots will be guests at the World Expo later this month. Sony and Honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics. Explaining why Hitachi's Emiew used wheels instead of feet, Toshihiko Horiuchi, from Hitachi's Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, said: \"We aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people.\" \"We want to make the robots useful for people ... If the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated.\" Emiew - Excellent Mobility and Interactive Existence as Workmate - can move at 3.7m/h. Its \"wheel feet\" resemble the bottom half of a Segway scooter. With sensors on the head, waist, and near the wheels, Pal and Chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. \"I want to be able to walk about in places like Shinjuku and Shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars,\" Pal told reporters. Hitachi said Pal and Chum, which have a vocabulary of about 100 words, could be \"trained\" for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years.\nRobotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. At the recent AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) annual meeting in Washington DC, researchers showed off bipedal designs. The three designs, each built by a different research group, use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait.\nSony and Honda have both used humanoid robots, which are not commercially available, as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. Honda's Asimo was \"born\" five years ago. Since then, Honda and Sony's Qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. Asimo, has visited the UK, Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Ireland as part of a world tour. Sony's Qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs. But its record was beaten by Asimo. It is capable of 3km/h, which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as Qrio. Last year, car maker Toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. By 2007, it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million \"entertainment and leisure\" robots in homes, compared to about 137,000 currently, according to the United Nations (UN). By the end of that year, 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes, said the report by the UN Economic Commission for Europe and the International Federation of Robotics. Hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market.",
    "The US budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (£197bn) this year, officials said on Tuesday.\nThe cost of military operations still needs to be factored in, with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red. Past Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. In recent months, the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. In November, the gap between US exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure. The CBO says it envisages a further \"orderly\" decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. But the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost US economic growth.\nThe budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 September 2004, after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year. The CBO also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections. However, analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president's plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. The figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. Republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 September attacks and ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of President George W Bush's election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. But Democrats have accused the president of excluding Iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit, a charge which the administration denies. On Tuesday, the US administration asked Congress for additional funds for military operations.",

A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said there were no plans to sell the channel.\nHe added that primary legislation would be required for the station to be sold off, which the government was not intending to introduce. Brookside was axed in 2003 after its ratings slumped from a peak of seven million to just 1.5 million.

    "Venezuelan authorities have identified more than 500 farms, including 56 large estates, as idle as it continues with its controversial land reform policy.\nUnder a 2001 land law, the government can tax or seize unused farm sites. A further 40,000 farms are yet to be inspected, the state's National Land Institute has told Associated Press. Vice president Jose Vicente Rangel has said farmers and ranchers with their titles in order and their lands productive have \"nothing to fear.\" Critics of the land reform policy claim president Hugo Chavez is trying to enforce a communist-style economic programme that ignores property rights and will damage the country. Land owners claim the National Land Institute has made mistakes in classifying lands as public or private.\nBut the government - Venezuela's largest land owner - say they are proceeding cautiously to prevent conflicts. In a statement, Mr Rangel said the land reform is not against the constitution, which permits private property, while stressing the efforts are to \"vindicate social and economically\" years of inequality in the country.\nOne property in conflict with the government is the El Charcote cattle ranch, run by Agroflora, a subsidiary of the UK food group Vestey. Agriculture minister Arnoldo Marquez told Reuters news agency the site's documents \"do not guarantee that this is a private land\". Administrators of the ranch, however, have complained that pro-Chavez squatters have taken over 80% of the property in the last four years, and the UK government has asked Venezuelan authorities to resolve the conflict. \"You should ask the company when they are going to put their papers in order and hand over the land that is not theirs,\" said Mr Marquez.",

Critics of the takeover have complained that the money could be better used by returning cash to shareholders. Deutsche Boerse also said profit in the three months to 31 December was 120.7m euros ($158.8m; £83.3m).

    "Asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the Asian tsunami and floods.\nWorld Bank president James Wolfensohn has said his agency is \"only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster\" and its economic impact. The tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit. Some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. Millions have been left homeless, while businesses and infrastructure have been washed away.\nEconomists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.\nIn Sri Lanka, some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. For Thailand, that figure is much lower at 0.1%. Governments are expected to take steps, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending, to facilitate a recovery.\n\"With the enormous displacement of people...there will be a serious relaxation of fiscal policy,\" Glenn Maguire, chief economist for the region at Societe Generale, told Agence France Presse. \"The economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005,\" he said. \"First and foremost this is a human tragedy.\" India's economy, however, is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. The regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004. But India now faces other problems, with aid workers under pressure to ensure a clean supply of water and sanitation to prevent an outbreak of disease.\nThailand's Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). Analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country's tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit. Thailand's fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by Sunday's 9.0 magnitude earthquake, which sent huge waves from Malaysia to Africa. Malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be \"significant\", Agence France Presse reported. Rapid rebuilding will be key to limiting the impact of the tragedy. \"In three months, we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces,\" said Juthamas Siriwan, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. The outlook for Sri Lanka is less optimistic, with analysts predicting that the country's tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly. Tourism is a vital to many developing countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).",
    "Ocean's Twelve, the crime caper sequel starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, has gone straight to number one in the US box office chart.\nIt took $40.8m (£21m) in weekend ticket sales, according to studio estimates. The sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across Europe. It knocked last week's number one, National Treasure, into third place. Wesley Snipes' Blade: Trinity was in second, taking $16.1m (£8.4m). Rounding out the top five was animated fable The Polar Express, starring Tom Hanks, and festive comedy Christmas with the Kranks.\nOcean's Twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a December release in the US, after the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean's Eleven which took $38.1m (£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (£95.8m) in total. A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean's Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh. Soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites Clooney, Pitt and Roberts with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the all-star cast. \"It's just a fun, good holiday movie,\" said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Bros. However, US critics were less complimentary about the $110m (£57.2m) project, with the Los Angeles Times labelling it a \"dispiriting vanity project\".

The division was tasked with improving US defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats. Reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation.\nMr Yoran took up his post in September 2003 and his first task was to get the Cyber Security Division up and running. The organisation had a staff of about 60 people and a budget of about $80m (£44.54m). The division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make US networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses, worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace.\nIn the last 12 months Mr Yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur. The warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks. The Cyber Security Division also audited US government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network. The next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers. Mr Yoran's division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals. Despite this success Mr Yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week, reportedly only giving one day's notice to bosses at the Department of Homeland Security. \"Amit Yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year, and we appreciate his efforts in starting the department's cybersecurity program,\" said a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman. Some reports have suggested that Mr Yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net-based threats in the wider homeland organisation. An attempt by US politicians to pass a law to promote Mr Yoran and raise the profile of his department's work is now mired in Congress.",
    "Oil prices carried on rising on Wednesday after cold weather on both sides of the North Atlantic pushed US crude prices to four-month highs.\nFreezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls took crude oil prices past $50 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since November. Declines in the dollar have also contributed to the rising oil price. US crude was trading at $51.39 at 0710 GMT in Asian electronic trade on Wednesday. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 at $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that, given such high prices, the cartel saw no reason to cut its output.\nAlthough below last year's peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004's average of $41.48. Brent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close.\nMuch of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. \"The primary factor is the weak dollar,\" said Victor Shum, a Singapore-based analyst with Purvin and Gertz. Expectations that a rebound in the dollar would halt the oil price rise were not immediately borne out on Wednesday morning, as oil prices carried on upwards as the dollar strengthened against the euro, the pound and the yen.\nSeveral Opec members said on Tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. \"I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,\" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters. \"I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,\" he added.",
    "Tony Blair has dismissed reports he told Gordon Brown he would quit before the next general election.\n\"You don't do deals over jobs like this,\" the prime minister told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme. According to a new book, Brown's Britain, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004. Mr Blair said the claims were \"reheated from six months ago\" and that he was concentrating on running the country. Mr Blair said: \"I've dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't.\n\"What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.\" The book, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston and serialised in the newspaper, said the pair had \"mutual animosity and contempt\" for each other.\nIt claims Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party. And that at a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott he told Mr Brown of his intention to stand down. According to Mr Peston the prime minister said: \"Help me to get through the year and I will then stand down.\" But he then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.\nMr Peston told BBC News: \"My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. \"What the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. \"I think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright, but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.\" But, in a wide-ranging BBC interview covering issues such as the Asian tsunami disaster, the Middle East peace process and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair said: \"When you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you. \"All sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims.\" He admitted to a \"sense of frustration\" about the allegations which he said had been made \"countless times\".\nThere has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami. These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blair's decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa. There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster. But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a \"load of nonsense\". Former welfare minister Frank Field MP said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown, but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so.\nTory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of \"squabbling like schoolboys\". He told Sky News' Sunday with Adam Boulton: \"This is the politics of the playground and Britain really does deserve better.\" The Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was \"getting in the way of good government\". \"Either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election.\" During the interview Mr Blair also said the former home secretary David Blunkett would play a \"big role\" at the general election.",
    "England coach Andy Robinson says English rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players' careers.\nHe will be without a host of big names for the Six Nations as the intensity of professional rugby union hits players. \"Injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the English season,\" Robinson told BBC Sport. \"I think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers.\" Robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the Six Nations with the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Will Greenwood injured.\nRugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago. As a result three of the major stakeholders in English rugby have launched an \"injury audit\" to find out how players are coping. The audit is jointly funded by the Professional Rugby Players' Association, the Rugby Football Union and Premier Rugby. As far as Robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored. \"I think there's an injury audit coming out in March that's got some great information in there that I think everybody in the English game has got to look at,\" he said. \"If we don't the situation is going to get worse and not better, so I think rugby as a whole has got to look at this.\"",
    "Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a \"super union\" of two million members.\nThe move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that \"nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda\" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday. Amicus's executive was due to meet in any case although the TGWU is holding specially scheduled talks.",
    "Actress Nicole Kidman has won a restraining order against two paparazzi photographers who she claims left her fearful of leaving her Sydney mansion.\nThe Oscar-winning star took action against Jamie Fawcett and Ben McDonald after a bugging device was found outside her home earlier this week. Lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device. The Australian actress is currently in Sydney to film her latest movie, Eucalyptus, with Russell Crowe. Kidman was prompted to take action following a reported high-speed car chase with members of the paparazzi in Sydney last weekend.\nAccording to local newspaper the Daily Telegraph, the incident involved paparazzi driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road in pursuit of Kidman's vehicle. Lawyers for Mr Fawcett and Mr McDonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase. Kidman sought the \"apprehended violence\" orders - normally used in Australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents - after being advised to do so by local police. \"Nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that,\" said Kidman's publicist Wendy Day. \"However, these are specific actions against two individuals who, over a period of time, have caused her to feel threatened, intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety.\" Magistrate Lee Gilmore, who issued the restraining order at Waverley Local Court in Sydney, said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour. \"Miss Kidman says she's willing to put up with some of it, but it's gone beyond that,\" she said. \"I do believe the allegation in relation to the driving is a serious issue.\"",
    "Oracle has announced it is cutting about 5,000 jobs following the completion of its $10.3bn takeover of its smaller rival Peoplesoft last week.\nThe company said it would retain more than 90% of Peoplesoft product development and product support staff. The cuts will affect about 9% of the 55,000 staff of the combined companies. Oracle's 18-month fight to acquire Peoplesoft was one of the most drawn-out and hard-fought US takeover battles of recent times. The merged companies are set to be a major force in the enterprise software market, second only in size to Germany's SAP.\nIn a statement, Oracle said it began notifying staff of redundancies on Friday and the process would continue over the next 10 days. \"By retaining the vast majority of Peoplesoft technical staff, Oracle will have the resources to deliver on the development and support commitments we have made to Peoplesoft customers over the last 18 months,\" Oracle's chief executive Larry Ellison said in a statement.\nCorrespondents say 6,000 job losses had been expected - and some suggest more cuts may be announced in future. They say Mr Ellison may be trying to placate Peoplesoft customers riled by Oracle's determined takeover strategy. Hours before Friday's announcement, there was a funereal air at Peoplesoft's headquarters, reported AP news agency. A Peoplesoft sign had been turned into shrine to the company, with flowers, candles and company memorabilia. \"We're mourning the passing of a great company,\" the agency quoted Peoplesoft worker David Ogden as saying. Other employees said they would rather be sacked than work for Oracle. \"The new company is going to be totally different,\" said Anil Aggarwal, Peoplesoft's director of database markets. \"Peoplesoft had an easygoing, relaxed atmosphere. Oracle has an edgy, aggressive atmosphere that's not conducive to innovative production.\" On the news, Oracle shares rose 15 cents - 1.1% - on Nasdaq. In after-hours trading the shares did not move.",
    "The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.\nThe Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn. The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn. The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.\nDemocrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.",
    "Thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in England and Wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.\nThe Countryside Alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal, but vowed to stay within the law. Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. One anti-hunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in Kent.\nThe man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the East Kent Hunt, near Ashford. In Wiltshire, police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs. The group, from South Wales and Ireland, have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.\nIt is believed more than 270 hunts went out on Saturday, just one day after the ban came in.\nThey were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country, with actor Jeremy Irons and former minister Kate Hoey among the supporters. Anti-hunt groups - such as the League Against Cruel Sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.\nMike Hobday, from the league, said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police. \"Our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law, many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting. \"However, we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across Britain.\" BBC correspondent Simon Hall at Postbridge on Dartmoor in the West Country said 2,000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.\nAnd the BBC's Sarah Mukherjee, with the Beaufort Hunt in Badminton, Gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt, with 150 on horseback. Tom Heap, BBC rural affairs correspondent, said it appeared that hunstman had, for now, been sticking to the new rules. And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday, he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.\nBefore riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: \"We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned.\" Judith Moritz, in Melton Mowbray, said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of Leicestershire, but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers. The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was \"impossibly difficult to determine\" and open to different interpretations.\nChief executive Simon Hart said: \"There has been hunting in England for 700 years. This [ban] may take two or three years, perhaps two or three months, to unpick. \"It will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service, as broadcasters say.\" Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed. Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts. The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law. He said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police \"in the near future\" to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.",
    "The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.\nThe Public and Commercial Services Union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.\nPCS leader Mark Serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.\n\"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\" BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented \"a formidable force\" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election. A stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.\nOpposition to raising the retirement age is \"one thing all the unions are agreed on\", our correspondent added. Unison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night. Our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations. There was \"some possibility\" of the strike action being avoided, he added.",
    "Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the \"stakes are too high\" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.\nThe chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 May - would give a \"clear and fundamental\" choice between Labour investment and Tory cuts. He told his party's spring conference the Tories must not be allowed to win. The Conservatives and Lib Dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under Labour.\nTo a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, Mr Brown accused shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country. Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: \"I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. \"Never again Tory boom and bust.\n\"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more.\" Turning to the economy, the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.\nHe also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. And he promised help to get young people on the property ladder. \"My message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto,\" he said. \"And the next Labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers' initiative.\" In the speech, which prompted a standing ovation, he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.\nHe also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. Responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, George Osborne, said: \"This was more talk from Gordon Brown. \"We've heard it all before. Instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past. \"He completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans. \"There will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the Conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\"\nLiberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable warned the picture was not as rosy as Mr Brown would like to portray it. \"For all his trumpeting of Labour's management of the economy, Gordon Brown's record is very mixed,\" he said. \"Gordon Brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy, a system which subjects millions of people to means testing, and a system of taxation which is extremely complex. \"For all his positive words, Gordon Brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon, not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation.\" Also in Gateshead, the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign. Mr Blair told the audience he believed the Iraq war would have made Britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible, but not before the job was done. He also said he wanted to carry on as PM \"because I still think that there are big changes our country needs\".",

Don't worry we've got it,\" Edelman told BBC Sport. \"Hopefully, we'll spend it this summer and in the coming years. Arsene attends all our board meetings and he knows our finances are very strong.\"\nEdelman added that it was pointless having a brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings. \"Its great to have nice, new surroundings, but if the team aren't performing on the pitch, then there isn't great respect in having a fabulous stadium,\" he said. \"It's important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place, before we began on the stadium.\"",
    "Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer.\nHe had to settle for bronze in Greece behind fellow American Justin Gatlin and Francis Obikwelu of Portugal. \"It really hurts to look at that medal. It was my mistake. I lost because of the things I did,\" said Greene, who races in Birmingham on Friday. \"It's never going to happen again. My goal - I'm going to win the worlds.\" Greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind Gatlin, who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. \"In my semi-final race, I should have won the race but I was conserving energy. \"That's when Francis Obikwelu came up and I took third because I didn't know he was there. \"I believe that's what put me in lane seven in the final and, while I was in lane seven, I couldn't feel anything in the race.\n\"I just felt like I was running all alone. \"I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me.\" Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg. The Kansas star is set to go head-to-head with Lewis-Francis again at Friday's Norwich Union Grand Prix. The pair contest the 60m, the distance over which Greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds. He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August. Greene believes Gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in Finland. But he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown. \"There's always someone else coming. I think when I was coming up I would say there was me and Ato (Boldon) in the young crowd,\" Greene said. \"Now you've got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time.\"",
    "Charlie Simpson took his new band Fightstar to the stage on Friday night, just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band Busted.\nHe was greeted by a sell-out crowd at the University of Warwick. Confirmation of Busted's long-rumoured split had come earlier in the day, when Simpson held a press conference in London with bandmates Matt Willis and James Bourne. All three band members stressed that the break up was amicable, although Bourne admitted he was \"devastated\" to hear of Simpson's departure. \"This has been a really difficult decision,\" 19-year-old Simpson revealed, \"I hope the fans will understand.\"\nWhile Simpson declared he would look back with pride on Busted's enormous success, his focus turned immediately to Fightstar, with Friday's press conference coinciding with the start of the band's 13-date tour of the UK. Fuelled by this news, all 1,400 tickets to see Charlie's first post-Busted live appearance - at the University of Warwick's Student Union - sold out rapidly. Mike Eccleshall, the venue's Promotions Coordinator, said: \"Tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days, but sales went mad after the news broke. We had completely sold out by 4pm.\"\nWith queues outside the venue long and expectations high, the pressure was on Fightstar to impress. Although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country, they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students, the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any Busted concert. Gone were the screaming girls to which Simpson had become accustomed. Support act Brigade, fronted by Simpson's brother, played a short set first and were met with general approval. When Fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm, however, a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd.\nUnfortunately, the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as Simpson's guitar amplifier failed to work. As sound technicians rushed to fix it, other band members did their best to improvise. When they eventually got under way, Fightstar's blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. Far heavier and less commercial than Busted's chart-topping pop-punk, the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. Warwick student Helen Clutterbuck admitted: \"I came to check out Fightstar because of all the controversy. \"I've never heard them before, but I'm pretty impressed.\" Less impressed were fellow students Ryan Crabbe and Gordon Rennie, who observed, \"With Fightstar, Charlie has clearly progressed from Busted's sound, but they're still not very inspiring.\" Fightstar played for around 45 minutes, showcasing material from their forthcoming EP called They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, due for release in February.",
    "India's biggest carmaker Maruti has reported a sharp increase in quarterly profit after a booming economy and low interest rates boosted demand.\nNet profit surged 70% to 2.39bn rupees ($54.98m; £29.32m) in the last three months of 2004 compared with 1.41bn rupees a year earlier. Total sales were 30.1bn rupees, up 27% from the same 2004 period. Maruti accounts for half of India's domestic car sales, luring consumers with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles.\nDemand in India also has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said.\nFigures show that only eight people per thousand are car owners. Maruti beat market expectations despite an increase in raw materials costs. The company, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki, said an increase in steel and other raw material prices was partially offset by cost cutting. Sales in the fiscal third quarter, including vans and utility vehicles, rose by 17.8% to 136.069 units. Maruti is not the only company benefiting as Indian's economic growth gives consumer greater spending power. Utility vehicle and tractor maker Mahindra has reported a 52% rise in net profit during the last three months of 2004. Profit was 1.33bn rupees compared with 874.2m rupees a year earlier.",
    "Harry Potter director Alfonso Cuaron has signed a three-year deal with Hollywood studio Warner Brothers, according to Variety trade magazine.\nThe Mexican film-maker, who directed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, will produce mainstream movies and smaller Spanish-language films. \"We had a wonderful experience with Alfonso on Harry Potter,\" Warner producer Jeff Robinov told Variety. Cuaron's other films include Mexican movie Y Tu Mama Tambien.\nThe 2001 rites-of-passage drama about two teenage boys who embark on a relationship with an older woman, brought Cuaron international attention - and box office glory.\nIt also won him and his brother Carlos, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Warner will distribute Cuaron's films in several languages outside the US. \"This deal will give us the opportunity to collaborate with Alfonso on movies that make the most of his artistry and vision, and continue to offer him the mainstream worldwide audiences that our studio provides so successfully,\" said Mr Robinov.\nHis first film for Warner Brothers was 1995's family fantasy movie A Little Princess. Based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, A Little Princess tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live in a New York boarding school when her widowed father enlists for war. After the erotic nature of Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third Harry Potter film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike.",
    "British actress Antonia Bernath is making her debut in Kisna - the Warrior Poet, marking a growing trend for non-Indian stars to appear in Bollywood films.\nDirected by Bollywood veteran Subhash Ghai, the film is set in the British Raj and Bernath plays an army general's daughter who falls in love with a rural boy, Kisna. \"I liked the fluid nature of film-making. We improvised quite a lot,\" says Bernath. \"At times it felt very chaotic but Mr Ghai was quite clear about what he wanted.\" Picked from more than 200 girls in an audition in London, Bernath cut short her education at Bristol's Old Vic Theatre School to take up the opportunity. It is not often that somebody gets to play the lead role straight out of a drama school. She spent three weeks learning Hindi and taking dance lessons. \"Initially, I was a bit sceptical about how people would respond to me,\" Bernath says. \"But I found the Hindi film industry very warm and encouraging. I even had a few offers before the work on Kisna was completed.\"\nFilms are one of India's biggest exports and those like Lagaan and Monsoon Wedding have broken the traditional boundaries of colour and culture. Spurred by this, Bollywood producers are trying to go global in all aspects of film-making, be it technical or artistic.\nFrom young heart-throbs like Nick Moran of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to model Sophie Dahl, many non-Indian stars want to make the most of this opportunity. \"Bollywood has truly gone global,\" says Taran Adarsh, editor of Indian film journal Trade Guide. \"Directors are now attempting to woo non-Asian audience to increase their share in the overseas film market.\" Kisna has been shot simultaneously in Hindi and English, with the English print shortened by an hour to accommodate the Western audience. The film even has a song composed in English by AR Rahman, the director of the popular West End musical, Bombay Dreams. \"Identification is a popular cinematic device. Use of European or American actors can be viewed as a step in that direction,\" says Adarsh.\nThe cast of Kisna also includes British actors Michael Maloney, Caroline Langrishe and Polly Adams.\nAnother actress, Annabelle Wallace, plays the lead role in a bilingual romantic comedy Dil Jo Bhi Kahey (Whatever the Heart Says), which also stars Indian screen legend Amitabh Bachchan. Actor and Producer Aamir Khan's forthcoming venture The Rising is set against the backdrop of the Indian mutiny of 1857, with British actor Toby Stephens in a key role. But it isn't only the Western actors looking eastwards.

    "Chancellor Gordon Brown will meet his golden economic rule \"with a margin to spare\", according to his former chief economic adviser.\nFormerly one of Mr Brown's closest Treasury aides, Ed Balls hinted at a Budget giveaway on 16 March. He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. Any rate rise ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning, he added. Last July, Mr Balls won the right to step down from his Treasury position and run for parliament, defending the Labour stronghold of Normanton in West Yorkshire.\nMr Balls rejected the allegation that Mr Brown had been sidelined in the election campaign, saying he was playing a \"different\" role to the one he played in the last two elections. He rejected speculation that Mr Brown was considering becoming Foreign Secretary, saying his recent travels had been linked to efforts to boost international development. Gordon Brown's decision to announce the date of the Budget while on a trip to China was a \"sensible thing to do\", since he was talking about skills and investment at the time, Mr Balls told the BBC. Commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise, he said it was not within the remit of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to factor a potential election into its rate decisions. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed that house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"I don't believe it would be a big election issue in Britain or a problem for Labour,\" Mr Balls said. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May as the likely day.",
    "All Blacks captain Tama Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour.\nBut Umaga, in England for Saturday's IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told BBC Sport: \"It's potentially the most fearsome line-up I've ever come up against. They're awesome. \"But I'd back us all the way to beat them when they come over.\" Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month.\nWhen Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former England players. But Umaga said: \"He'd be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. \"Don't get me wrong, England have got a lot of talented guys and I'm sure there are some of them who'll make the Lions Test XV. \"But you can't disguise Wales and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they've scored have been great. I'll admit it'll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O'Driscoll.\"\nUmaga will meet O'Driscoll in Saturday's Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side. O'Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. \"It'll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,\" Umaga said. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was immense, calling it \"the biggest thing to hit New Zealand since Lord of the Rings\". He added: \"As players, it's enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it's not just us All Blacks - it's the talk of the country.\"\nUmaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday's charity game, which features a host of big names including George Gregan, Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. \"The second [Southern Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I didn't hesitate. It was great when New Zealand Rugby then gave me the all clear. \"Thankfully I didn't know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn't miss all the horrific reports on the news. \"There are so many people that were affected, are still affected and will be affected for a long time. It's just good to know we can do something minor to help out.\"\n- The match will be televised on BBC One at 1400 GMT on Saturday.",
    "Glenn Hoddle has been unveiled as the new Wolves manager.\nThe ex-England coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed Dave Jones, who was sacked after the club's poor start to the season. Wolves chairman Rick Hayward said: \"We're delighted Glenn is here. He has a six-month contract so we can test each other out and see if it works.\" Hoddle, who will work alongside Stuart Gray, has been out of the game since he was sacked by Spurs in 2003. Gray, who has been caretaker manager, was assistant boss when Hoddle was manager at Southampton. \"I'm delighted to be here,\" said Hoddle.\n\"I saw the massive potential that Wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the Premiership parallels my ambitions. \"Stuart Gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager. We've worked together at Southampton and I'm delighted to be back with him.\" Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey defended the decision to give Hoddle a short-term contract. \"We hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term,\" he said. \"Most managers want a four-year contract and then expect it to be paid off if it doesn't work out. \"For somebody of Glenn's calibre to come in on a short-term contract and put his reputation on the line, it demonstrates his commitment and self-belief and the potential he thinks is here.\" Hayward revealed that Hoddle was one of the first to be approached after Jones' departure. \"He was not available at the time because he was looking at various other things,\" he explained. \"Five weeks later we're back on track and this a tremendous opportunity for Wolves.\"\nHoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job. His spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. The 47-year-old later returned to management with Southampton, where he again succeeded Jones - as he has now done at Wolves. He engineered an upturn in Saints' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. That relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the London club early last season. Since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of France manager and had also been linked with a return to Southampton. Wolves are currently 17th in the Championship and have a home game against Millwall on Tuesday.",
    "Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned.\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to end its Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) on midnight of 31 December. Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\nIt added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.",
    "Former All Black star Jonah Lomu says he cannot wait to run out on the pitch for former England rugby union captain Martin Johnson's testimonial on 4 June.\nThe 29-year-old had a kidney transplant in July 2004 but will play his first full match for three years, leading a southern hemisphere side at Twickenham. \"I actually started training three weeks after my operation but I was very limited until a few months ago. \"Now it's basically bring it on!\" said the giant winger. \"The match on 4 June will be my first 15-man game but I have a training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and a whole lot of things,\" said Lomu. \"I have got so much energy since my operation that I train three times a day, six days a week.\n\"Mohammed Ali has always been my ideal. Coming back to rugby, people said 'you are dreaming' but it always starts off with a dream. \"It's up to you whether you want to make it a reality.\" Opinion has been divided on whether Lomu should attempt to return to the game after such a major operation. But when Lomu was asked whether he was taking a risk he replied: \"As much as someone going down the road being hit by a bus. \"There are a lot of people in the world with one kidney who just don't know it. \"I have talked this over, had a chat with the donor and this is to set my soul at peace and finish something I started in 1994 [when he made his All Blacks debut].\" At his lowest ebb Lomu was so ill he could barely walk, but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long-term target is to play for New Zealand again. \"The only person who saw me at my worst was my wife,\" he added. \"I used to take two steps and fall over but now I can run and it is all coming back, and a lot more quickly than I ever thought it would. \"To play for the All Blacks would be the highest honour I could get. That is the long-term goal and you have to start somewhere.\"",
    "Hollywood actors Samuel L Jackson and Ben Stiller have signed up for Ricky Gervais' new sitcom, the comedian has told BBC News.\nHe said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom Extras. They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\" Gervais told BBC News.\n\"It's not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.\n\"I didn't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven't even been asked. \"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore's part. I haven't been approached and I wouldn't take it anyway.\"\nHe said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \"twisted\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \"would sail pretty close to the bone\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \"A film will happen over the next three years but I don't want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn't be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\"",
    "Talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.\nFive public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain's biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.\nThe five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the \"less painful\" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. \"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\"\nUnison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.",
    "Singer Britney Spears is suing eight insurance companies that have refused to reimburse her for cancelling her 2004 world tour.\nThe pop star cancelled her Onyx Hotel tour last June after suffering a knee injury during a video shoot. She is now seeking to be reimbursed for the tour's £5m ($9.3m) costs in a claim filed at New York State Supreme Court. Seven London-based companies and an eighth Paris firm have been given up to 30 days to respond to the complaint.\nThe 22-year-old star initially missed a number of shows on the 82-date tour after injuring her knee during a show in Illinois last March. But she was rushed to hospital and needed surgery after a later incident while filming a video for her song Outrageous, leading her to cancel the rest of the tour, including dates in China. \"She obviously took a wrong step and blew out her knee,\" a Jive spokeswoman said at the time. \"It was an old dance injury.\" The legal submission described Spears as \"one of the most recognised performers in her industry\". The Onyx Hotel tour was cited as \"a highly crafted production which included the well-known music and dancing of Spears, supported by elaborate costumes, complex choreography as well as cutting-edge video production, lighting and other effects\". In September Spears married Kevin Federline, who had been a dancer on the aborted tour.",
    "Manchester City's Paul Bosvelt will find out \"within a month\" whether he is to be offered a new one-year deal.\nThe 34-year-old Dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and, although his age may count against him, he feels he can play on for another season. \"I told the club I would like to stay for one more year. They promised me an answer within the next month so I am waiting to see,\" he said. \"The main concern is my age but I think I have proved I am fit enough. Bosvelt joined City from Feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in England. But his professionalism and dedication impressed manager Kevin Keegan. \"He realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team. He is an unsung hero,\" said Keegan.",
    "The ultimate prize of 10 Downing Street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget, Gordon Brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.\nHe reached that milestone last June, when he overtook David Lloyd George, who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. How much longer Mr Brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: \"those who fail and those who get out in time.\") There are rumours he will be moved to the Foreign Office if Labour wins the general election. But, for now, Mr Brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.\nGordon Brown was born in Glasgow on 20 February 1951, the son of a Church of Scotland Minister in the small Fife town of Kirkcaldy. At 12, he was canvassing for Labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in Scotland. He achieved a first class degree in history from Edinburgh University, where he went on to complete a PhD. His early career was spent lecturing, working in television and making a name for himself in the Scottish Labour Party.\nHis first attempt to enter Westminster, for Edinburgh South in 1979, was thwarted by the present Tory spokesman on foreign affairs, Michael Ancram. But in 1983, he took Dunfermline East, a new constituency including Rosyth naval base, pit villages and coastal towns.\nEntering Westminster, he came to share an office with the newly elected MP for Sedgefield, Tony Blair. Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. He became shadow chancellor under John Smith's leadership in 1992. After the death of leader John Smith in 1994 he stood aside, agreeing to give Tony Blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the Granita restaurant in Islington.\nThe other part of the deal, that Mr Blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of Westminster legend. Mr Blair's supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. But if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, Mr Brown continued his devotion to politics. During the 1997 election campaign, he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day, six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.\nThis dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by Mr Brown's former girlfriend of five years, Princess Marguerite of Romania, the eldest daughter of ex-King Michael of Romania, who said a relationship with him was \"politics, politics, politics\".\nIf that was true then, Mr Brown, who married PR executive Sarah Macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. Their daughter Jennifer died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, 10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. A year later, in October 2003, the couple had a son - John - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. A trip to Africa earlier this year, to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations, also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.\nThe ideological differences between Mr Brown and Mr Blair remain relatively modest. The chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the NHS and is seen as being more \"Old Labour\" than Mr Blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. But their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the New Labour project. Yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict, with Mr Brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger Downing Street neighbour over the succession. Mr Blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful Mr Brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his Budget until the last possible minute. After a recent run of negative headlines, Labour MPs took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering, for the good of the party. Events like this, and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues, make it impossible to dismiss the Brown/Blair feud as just journalistic hearsay, cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of Westminster. How much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question.\nA truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by Blairite Alan Milburn being brought in over the head of Mr Brown to run the election campaign. But with the Tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that Mr Brown - using the Budget as a springboard - is to revitalise Labour's campaign. Amid all this it is easy to forget that Mr Brown remains the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader. There may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including Mr Milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that Mr Brown can. And Mr Blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given Mr Brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister's intention to \"serve a full third term\" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.",
    "The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline.\nBrazil's airport authority chief Carlos Wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save Varig, Brazil's flagship airline. However, the country's vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. Varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais ($2.3bn or £1.2bn). Asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country's Congress to discuss the airline's crisis, Mr Alencar replied: \"No, I don't think so. We will see.\"\nEarlier, Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week. \"In practice, it will be an intervention, although this is not the technical name used\", he said. An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. For that to happen Varig's main shareholder, the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline's employees, would have to be removed, Mr Wilson said. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. Varig, which operates in 18 countries apart from Brazil, has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country's economic downturn.\nThe depreciation of Brazil's currency has had a direct impact on the airline's dollar debt as well as some of its costs. Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the Brazilian economy. The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m), after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992. But the government can appeal the decision.",
    "Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer, has died.\nMr Raskin was one of the first employees at Apple and made many of the design decisions that made the Mac so distinctive when it was first released. He led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. The 1984 release of the Mac reflected Mr Raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use.\nMr Raskin joined Apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead the company's publications department. However, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.\nThe result was the 1984 Macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. Users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing, clicking and dragging. Although now in common use in almost all computers, these methods were pioneering when first used in the Macintosh. The GUI was developed by Xerox PARC, and used in its Star machine. But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer. \"His role on the Macintosh was the initiator of the project, so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him,\" said Andy Hertzfeld, an early Macintosh team member. Although Mr Raskin drove the team that created the Macintosh he did not stay at Apple to see it released. In 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with Apple's mercurial boss Steve Jobs. In 1982, Mr Raskin left Apple entirely. The Macintosh was reputedly named after Mr Raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. After leaving Apple, Mr Raskin founded another company called Information Appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. He was also an accomplished musician, played three instruments and conducted San Francisco's Chamber Opera Society. Mr Raskin was diagnosed in December 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 February at his home in California.",
    "The law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales is enforceable and \"very clear\", Alun Michael has said.\nThe rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law, which came into force on Friday, and pretended they were not. Some 270 hunts met legally on Saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds. But anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. Countryside Alliance chairman John Jackson said that Saturday had been a \"massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting\". People had turned out \"to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law\", he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed \"legally\" as far as he was aware.\nAlthough hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: \"There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting. \"The reality is that the law is very clear. You can't chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs, whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer. \"If people do so and pretend they're not it's going to become very clear. You can't hunt accidentally.\" Mr Michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. He said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy, the health service and their children's future than hunting.\nBut the League Against Cruel Sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. Thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across England and Wales on the first day of the ban, with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken. There were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in Wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the Hunting Act.\nThey have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. But Penny Little, who monitored the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, said she had witnessed \"gratuitous, spiteful killing of foxes\". If people tried to \"run circles around this law\" the only outcome would be that it was tightened up, she said. Mike Hobday, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. He said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. But Mr Jackson, who had been at the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, denied there was any intimidation.",

He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I had zero anxiety about getting this shot, I’m a perfectly healthy 26 year old male. However, I had a terrible experience getting the first vaccine. Two minutes after injection, my ears start ringing and I become lightheaded. Next, my vision starts to blacken and become distorted. This intensified for several minutes and I was sweating an insane amount. At this point I’m freaking tf out because I can’t see nor can I hear and I know I’m like the only person having this experience. I did not flag anyone down I just waited in panic hoping my senses would return. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was only 3 minutes, my vision started to return and I suddenly got freezing although I continued to sweat. I left feeling like I just had intercourse against my will, and I also did not tell anyone at the site. I now feel very reluctant to get the 2nd Pfizer dose and am overall just still shocked I had such a terrible experience. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I have told someone?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I don’t know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",
    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",
    "We’ve been in a relationship since 7 years now , there were a few months where we not in  contact because I wanted a break from this and also when things went wrong real bad  we had a break for 4 months but then got back . I’ve been trying to hold this relationship and make it all work since 8 months now and it’s been very rough which includes me crying since 4 months straight everyday , he gave me many traumatic experiences which are hard to forget till date like lying for every small to big thing , body insecurities where I felt inadequate unworthy.  Having  a good enough body but just a smaller chest with inverted nipples , he made me feel little about my 2 insecurities and never enough . I still held on until now but I’ve begun to question is it worth it ? Will someone love me better ? I used to be scared with the process of falling in love all over again but now my hurt in this relationship has gone so beyond that I don’t know , if putting an end to this relationship which is my everything is the best thing I can/should do .",
    "Sooo you know how every character has 3 lives in the Dream Smp? How did they get those 3 lives in the first place? What if the second and third lives are just copies of the FIRST life. You may say this makes no sense but how do you just die and come back all fine with all your memories? Also there is a book called the revive book on the server which only dream possesses and has been used TWICE. Once on Tommy and once on Henry his pet cow. Which shows that the revive book can be used multiple times and the person you used it on gains all their memories after revival. So what if you can revive the \"copies\" or your \"lives\" that you have lost through the revive book basically creating infinite copies of you with all your memories. I mean they have to go some where right? The dead have to go somewhere RIGHT? Comment on this post if you think this theory is viable or its just bs. Also I have another question that is how or who created/found the revive book and gave it to Jschlatt who then gave it to Dream?",
    "Every Sunday night, my girlfriend and I FaceTime each other in order talk about our week and bring up any unresolved issues. While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer. I said yes because I assumed it was urgent and it was only going to be a 1 or 2 minute call. 20 minutes go by and they’re still on the phone while I’m there on FaceTime with her and she’s having a whole conversation with him. I became pretty upset over this, so I hung up the call and messaged her saying to call me when she’s done. She then proceeded to FaceTime the guy and she told me they were just doing homework together. I don’t know what to think of this. Any advice would be helpful, like is this normal or appropriate?",
    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

I just got done copying my friend's work on things I was supposed to pass one whole semester ago but some works I still need to do I just can't copy. It's those activities where you take a video of yourself giving a speech or acting or something like that. I can't do it because I hate looking at myself and I can't muster up any will to do it. I just want to say to my teacher that i don't want to do it. It's stupid but I thought of using text to speech and just having a static image of my face, but i can't even do that cause the text to speech for my language is horrible. Do I just say that I won't pass it? I don't see myself graduating anyway whether or not I complete this activity.",

    "I recently got a job, pay's decent and kind of fun, but it has no benefits and is far from a forever job. I really like the owner and wouldn't want to screw him over when the time does come to leave. When accepting a new position, how do you go about the whole two week notice thing? Are employers actually cool with saying,\" Oh I can start in two weeks.\"? It feels to me like an employer might be upset or go with someone else if you can't start soon/immediately, but that may not really be the case in the professional world. I'm just not really sure how to tread that path as I've always had a period between each job, so have not had to deal with breaking it off with one company and beginning another at the same time.",
    "It’s getting so much worse I don’t want to leave my house but I’m too scared to stay alone. When there is a storm I panic and my stomach hurts so bad. Like even when there is slight rain or the clouds look weird I start panicking. I hate hearing noises except for my fan, phone and soft voices from the tv. Where I live tornados happen a lot and it scares me so much I don’t know how to deal with it. I always have really bad dreams of me dying in a storm, tornado or tsunami it happens to very day and it makes me not want to sleep. I have to wait for myself to pass out to actually get any sleep.

She refused to acknowlege that I have cancelled my phone service in December and that they overbilled my account. I even signed a new contract that removed the phone line from the account in December but she blantantly ignored that proof. I have called multiple times and was told that they were going to reflect in their system that the service was cancelled in December and that I would be issued a refund.  I have yet to receive my refund and this last representative refused to help me.  I am beyond frustrated with this company. What's worse is that Comcast is the only provider in my area so I am forced to deal with a company that is incompetent and lacks quality customer service.",

Just finished watching the latest 90 Day The Single Life and she is once again calling Mohamed trying to get yet another apology. It's been what, 7 years, since the whole relationship unraveled? She's asked for several apologies. None of the apologies have been sincere, and she just keeps going back for more. She'll never be satisfied. Obviously Mohamed feels no guilt. She's never going to get that apology from him. She just needs to get over the whole thing, close the chapter, and get on with her life. She's a total drama queen. It almost seems like she's a little obsessed with Mohamed. As much as I am not a Mohamed fan either, I actually think I feel sorry for him. She's that annoying cousin you can't get rid of.

    "Title pretty much explains it all, my cat hates his wet food. I know wet food is much better for cats than the dry stuff, but my little guys just won’t eat it 95% of the time, I put it out and he turns his head an walks away. I’ve tried many many different types of food, and he doesn’t like any of it. He absolutely loves the dry stuff though, sits there and meows and begs for it constantly. After a while of him not eating the wet stuff I usually end up caving and giving him the dry stuff cause, obviously, I don’t want him to starve. I know cats are supposed to eat the wet stuff, that’s where they get most of their fluids from and it’s just better in general, so I’d like to get him to eat it, but he just outright refuses most of the time. On the rare occasion he does eat it, he’ll just eat like half and then leave the rest. What the heck can I do? Should I just give up on the wet stuff and only give him dry? He does have a fancy little water fountain that I see him drinking out of, so I know he isn’t dehydrated, but the lack of eating good food is a bit concerning. He’s about 5 years old, and has kind of always been this way, but recently has gotten worse. I even bought him some special bowls because I was worried it might be whisker fatigue, but that hasn’t helped either. If anybody had any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",
    "Why exactly do you care how we choose to play your game? Why do you care how many legos we get and how fast we can murder the toughest enemies? Why do you care which classes and builds are the most popular? See, we already bought your full game and we liked it the way it was. You don't buy a car that you like, only for the salesman to come back later and ruin some of the best parts of your car that he already sold you. There's no microtransactions or DLC or anything else in this game that you still need to sell us. This is not some scammy F2P or live service game where devs nerf one thing to make the new cash cow more attractive and profitable. So yeah, I'm just really struggling to understand the logic behind all these nerfs here. You guys spent 5 years on your game and released it the way it is. We bought your game and liked it the way it was. So once again, why are you nerfing stuff? Did you guys hire a game designer from some F2P or live service game? Because this is the kind of stuff only they would do. Except it won't lead to profits for you, as there's nothing else to sell us. So you are only gonna lose players as a result.

    "So for the past couple of years I’ve gotten into a crazy bad habit of eating massive amounts of food late night. I’m not super active in working out but also not super out of shape from my eating habits. I’m 22, 6’0 213 pounds but I consume inhumane amounts of food late. I’ll go and get 6 different entree items from fast food joints at like 9 o clock at night and it makes me feel like shit. I’ll probably eat enough food for 2 or 3 people and not even think about it and I’ve tried dieting and can never seem to make it past a week or 2. I’ve left credit cards at home to insure I don’t go out and then I just started door dashing. Any advice on stopping this nasty habit?? My metabolism is only gonna get worse with age.

    "I got a bunch of money back from taxes today and I was excited because I wouldn’t have to worry about my bills. Then I decided to try to think of a way to treat myself. All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you. I’d give the whole sum up entirely to speak to you again or just to know if you were safe and happy. Yesterday was trans day of visibility I hope your day was safe and you had a good time. I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit. I still don’t know why you left but I would rather die than see you unhappy so I will keep this letter unsent.",
    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",

His pervert side is still annoying but i feel like it is author trying to be  funny but failing mostly. Otherwise he is really great later on even this situation when he said sorry to Mizuhara for not running after her made me sad for the guy and later on there where more moments where i really felt some emotions after him trying to open himself or trying to be brave.

    "Ages ago it has its battery changed; after it wouldn’t turn on with the battery plugged in nor would the battery take any charge. It has done little other than sit since unused since then. Recently I decided I’d try using it so I readied a bootable El Capitan usb as it’s hard drive is completely blank, but the MacBook wouldn’t turn on. I eventually found out that holding down the power button for 10 seconds and then plugging it in continuing to hold down the power button for another 10 seconds. When it does turn on the fans are full blast and whether it’s to El Capitan install, High Sierra install, internet recovery, or the hard drive from a know working MacBook it will only make it a little past halfway before shutting off and coming back on again only to repeat. If it is turned off anyway other than when it shuts itself off the 20 second power button thing has to be done again. I’ve tried an nvram/pram reset and the option+command+shift+power to no avail. On the inside there’s no evidence of water damage. I’ve been trying at it for two days now and I’m out of ideas as to what the problem could be.",
    "I feel so incredibly anxious. I can’t sit still. After a rollercoaster emotionally abusive relationship that lasted two years and after 1 year sharing an apartment together, I moved across the country for a while. After a month of not seeing him, I’m back. I’m seeing him tonight. The level of anxiety I feel is unreal. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without feeling nauseated with unease. We wanted to meet up to get closure for everything that happened, but it was a toxic relationship. He begged for me back a week ago and has been standoffish the last few days. He told me he’s incredibly depressed and wants to want to seek help, but it seems that he won’t. He’s erratic in his communication and seemingly his feelings toward me. He says he feels like it’s going to be weird to see each other and I feel the same, to an extent. Despite everything he’s done and everything that’s happened, I miss him and am excited to see him. I don’t know whether or not that’s wrong.. people who are close to me tell me that I shouldn’t see him at all. I can’t help but feel drawn to him, even if it’s for the last time.

Maybe they could have showed us a small glimp of the struggles people faced after the blip and the struggles the blip refugees are going through ,but none of it was hinted properly at all. It was just \"bad\" things that's happening and we're supposed to relate with that suddenly.",
    "I am like 90% sure Isayama was made to make the ending more digestable. Why, you ask? All we have to do is look at the Season 2 ED. EVERYTHING is a reference there, EVEN THE FUCKING BABY is in there. Do you know what was in there that we've never seen? The mass of people wandering away. Those surely had to be the collossals turning back. This in itself is not the reason why many people dislike the ending, but I can surely say that some things were fucked with, and I doubt that that was the only one. I can even imagine some executive telling him literally after 138 that \"yeah man your shits fucked up no way we can have those characters die. figure it out\" Jean and Connie were brought back without even them getting brought back. They just kind of.. appeared? I don't know, maybe it's just my last dose of copium, but I am convinced that this was not that was envisioned.",
    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it. It feels so good to have purpose again in my life and to seek out these challenges that are hard instead of running away from the hard things like I use to do.",
    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I know that I am overly quiet in social situations, and that it’s because a lot of the time I overthink anything I might say. Most of the time it keeps me from saying anything at all. I feel like it makes people think I’m stuck up or unapproachable. People tend to fill in the blanks if you know what I mean. A lot of people will say I should try not to think so much and just say the first thing that comes to mind, but the thing is on those rare occasions where I don’t overthink too much and start to get comfortable so I actually talk to people I feel like a lot of the time I’m awkward, and in ways I can’t always quite put my finger on either. Like I put my foot in my mouth or overshare or just say odd things that people don’t know how to respond to. It all makes me cringe and go back into that overthinking mode and I feel socially inept. It makes me want to cry and be a hermit. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just need to vent. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "So this post is going to be somewhat of a jumbled mess as I dictated in my car as I’m driving from my iPhone but I just had a thought after reading some news about student loan forgiveness and with all the money that’s been spent through the government I think there’s an agenda in motion to cancel Fiat currency and the future is going to be only a Cryptocurrency somewhat like China just did. the United States will probably create its own so I don’t know where that leaves all the currencies that we have now but I think it’s important that we invest as much as we can into these currency’s now. I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can. And thank you for reading this if you did. And please comment your thoughts",
    "Honestly, the storyline I'm most worried about in the show is the shipwreck storyline with Matthias and Nina. All the other storylines in the show, including the crows, tie in to Alina's story, and are all connected. But I feel like, especially for new viewers, the Helnik storyline is just gonna feel like a random shipwreck in a random part of the world with two random characters who we don't really care about and have nothing to do with the main storyline with Alina. I just feel like it will feel a bit random and disconnected to the rest of the plot, especially considering all the other plots are connected. Maybe they have come up with a sensible way to believably tie them together, but even then it doesn't really look like nina and matthias is gonna interact with or even meet any of the other characters, unless it's just one scene at the beginning or the ending. I think I am most worried about the fact that new viewers are gonna be confused and not really care about the storyline at all.",
    "A car accident has recently left me without a car. I sustained a back/neck injury in the accident that has left me unable to work, or even sit/stand for more than 15 minutes at a time. Because of this I have found cooking and cleaning very difficult, almost impossible.  This had lead to me needing to order out almost every meal. Funds are dwindling and I'm getting extremely overwhelmed. I've been finding it very difficult to even keep trying. I've been in too much pain to effectively  take care of myself. My lease is expiring soon and I'm still looking for another place as my landlord is no longer renting the house I'm staying in. I'm just stuck in a rut and can't find a light at the end of the tunnel. Does anyone have any words of advice?",
    "Does anyone else ever feel like when you're having a hard time with something, you have no one to turn to and confide in? I have trouble opening up to people and even though I'm one of the first to recommend therapy, I'm not currently IN therapy even though I know I should be. I feel like I can't even talk to my partner because they keep recommending therapy and while I know they aren't my therapist sometimes I just need to talk to someone. I moved to a new state in order to be with my partner a few years ago and have struggled hard with making new friends, got a better paying but less satisfying job, we're even expecting our first kid soon. I feel so unimportant and completely unnecessary in my own life. It's been a while since I felt like this, last time was a few years after my mom died.

    "I don't want to be like this - I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life posting about my heartaches. I don't romanticize heartbreaks. I dont intentionally torture myself with thoughts of you, they just come to me - like a thief in the night, leaving me robbed and helpless. There's nothing sweet about this and I'm far too logical for this. I don't enjoy wracking my brain, trying to find words that would best describe how I feel - and every time failing because no words could really come close to how gut wrenching, soul destroying this is. I put into words how I feel because supposedly it helps - I haven't seen any result yet at all. There's only one thing that would help me - and that only comprises of three letters - YOU. I'm so fed up with myself. I have no fucking illusions, no grandiose dreams of getting back together, of a happily ever after. I've lived in the fairy tale we have created long enough - and I'm living now my reality. I'm tired to my bones of feeling this way...I just want to move on. I'm not harboring any negative thoughts about you or about myself - no blaming, it is what it is. Some relationships are not meant to last, and some people are not meant to be together. That is life and I'm well too aware of it. But fuuuuuck, the pain. I just want it to stop. Now. Not when I'm six feet under the ground and I wouldn't give a fuck at all. I don't want to continue going through this anymore. I have accepted that we are not meant to be. I'm not angry about that. Just please, let me be free of this pain. Cause I just can't anymore.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country.

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",

I just tried another movie tonight and I had it set to direct stream, but it failed converting again. I had the mode set to auto, so I changed it to force and it loaded up super fast but said it couldn't detect any audio. So it played the direct stream 35mbps 4k beautifully, but without sound.

    "This started before I went on vacation, but out of know where or it came on gradually a burning and discomfort pain inside my penis all the way up to the groin. The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",

The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",
    "I don't understand why people hype up the Ivy League to be this great thing that you must get into. I personally didn't apply to any. Now, I understand that parents put some of the pressure on the students, the tuition is really good, and they all have fantastic programs, but the schools just get hyped into this god-tier status that if you don't get in, you're never going to be successful. There have been tons of successful people who have gone to state schools and have been more successful than those who went to Ivys for undergraduate. If you don't believe me, do a quick google search. Furthermore, jobs don't care about where you went to undergraduate. They care about what experience you have. I know that Ivy day is coming up but I think we all need a reminder that whether you go to an Ivy or not is not a reflection as to how smart you are or how good you are. Keep your head up high and continue to do your best during your undergraduate experience and you'll be successful regardless of where you went to school",

For the past three years or so, I have been consistently getting choppy haircuts with chunky layers that need to be fixed every time. I just got a haircut yesterday. The top 2/3 of my hair looks fine, but the bottom third looks about half as thick and very choppy and bizarre. I’m going to have to cut it again. I haven’t been able to grow my hair past shoulder length because this keeps happening. There’s no way that I just have bad luck picking hair dressers.

My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

The allies had pushed me back almost to Berlin but then I mounted a massive counter attack on the Eastern front and reached all the way to Stalingrad which capitulated Russia.

But still I mounted a western front counter attack and pushed the allies back to the Benelux border. My attacks were green across the bord and the troops I had spent the last year preparing were making short work of the entente. But then suddenly out of nowhere I get hit by the Versailles treaty.

    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant. I have been complimented on the smell of my hair multiple times but I do not know how to make my body smell very good. Does anyone have any good body wash recommendations, body lotions, body oils, or perfumes to make yourself smell really good? Has anyone been complimented on smelling good all the time, and if so, what do you use? I have heard the Yves Saint Lauren perfume is amazing and I will buy that, but I was also thinking of just using something to smell good all the time naturally, not exactly with perfumes all the time. And by smelling good, I mean I really want people to constantly compliment me on how good I smell when they get closer, I am not really talking about just preventing from smelling bad or smelling neutral, or decent, but just smelling really good. Let me know, thank you.",
    "So last night my roommates, some friends, and I were having a good time having a bonfire. I decided to get wonky for the social gathering so I kept going back inside to my room to snort more ket. We have like 5 snakes and my roommate was showing one of our guests her snakes but one of them nudged the heat lamp keeping them warm when they were going back outside to the fire. Some time passes and I decided to go inside and snort some more ket. But when I go inside it smelled like something was burning but I didn't think much of it since we were having a bon fire. I proceeded to my room until I got near the reptile room and saw a bunch of smoke in that area. I freaked out and looked for the source and saw it had something to do with the heat lamp. I was so wonked I really didn't know what was starting to burn and catch on fire but I immediately ran back outside to inform my roommates something was catching on fire. They come inside and fixed the situation. Man, that was a close call. Thank god for my ketamine addiction and that I decided to get wonky af that night. I could've not have a place to live today if I didn't want to go back inside to continue the wonk. I just felt the need to share this with everyone. Thank you guys for listening to my experience last night. That was pretty scary when I finally thought about it.",

In the milliseconds before someone hugs me, I think through how I will have to hold my arms, if they are going one arm up and one down or both up or both down or a side hug. For high-fives, it’s the same issue. Some people will grab your hand when you high-five, others have a weird pull you in for a hug thing, some grab your hand after slapping it and shake it or something.

    "I bought my first truck recently. It belonged to my dad’s boss who pretty much babies his vehicles. Only he let this sit for about a year. I got a pretty good deal on it considering which I wouldn’t normally do if my dad didn’t trust the guy. I couldn’t take it home at first because we found a fuel line leak. We repaired it and we jumped it and it ran really good. Until it died on an exit ramp. We got it towed home and it hasn’t started since. We’ve replaced the batter and now the ignition coil. It will turn over but it just won’t start. It’s an electrical problem because I’m not getting sparks from the ignition coil, hence the replacement. But still nothing.

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",

    "Like two months ago I was using my newly acquired prostate vibrator, so to get things into perspective I was laying in my back inside my bed just chilling with the vibrator in while I tried to meditate and then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere a huge wave from my prostate flew through my whole body, it was so fucking pleasurable and only took like 4 seconds it even made me open my mouth as if I was about to moan, never had anything like it again, no cum came out it was just so good, after those pleasurable 4 seconds I thought \"I have no idea of what the fuck that was but I loved it\", that shit is the only reason I am still into prostate play cause after that until now I have felt nothing from it again not even a p wave I think, am I doing something wrong, and for God's sake someone tell me what the fuck that was",
    "One time I went to a party in Dahlonega, we started out at Taco Mac getting really drunk. I started getting really frisky so the two guys I was there with took me out back to where their truck was parked, turn down the music in there truck, and we started our own party. Of course I started taking my clothes off and dancing for everybody that had gathered. I brought one guy up on the bed of the truck with me and started putting his hands all over me. Eventually he started touching me and feeling me up, he took off my pants and started finger me in front of everybody. And his buddy got up on the truck push me down on my knees and stuck its dick in my mouth. They put me down on all fours and spit roasted me for a while... Then other people started climbing on the truck, a few other women took off their clothes and we all started sucking each other. Mostly us girls and the guys watching sucking on each other's tits, licking each other's pussy, trying to fit as many fingers as we could inside each other. But some guys were still up in the truck fucking us and putting bottles in us, and other things they were finding, not quite sure what was inside me at some points. But of course someone had to spoil the fun and eventually the cops showed and threatened to start arresting people if we didn’t pack it up.",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "Easter night. 98 years old. I got to hold her hand, touch her hair, and kiss her forehead. I got to say goodbye hours before she passed. I took pictures of her photos hanging on her walls, I took in the smell of her bedroom, I walked around her kitchen with family one last time. It was such a beautiful day, perfect weather, the sun was shining, birds were chirping. My aunt said to me \"when I hear the birds sing, I'll always remember mom.\" It broke my heart. I love my grandma. I love my family. Every family has its problems, I learned so much just from sitting and listening to my aunts and uncle talk that those problems just didn't matter. We are family. They had so much wisdom and love to give to me. They knew I wasn't very close with her, but they let me sit as long as I needed with her. I'm so happy I didn't wait any longer to see her. My brothers didn't get to say goodbye, only me. I feel lucky to have looked into those blue eyes one last time. I know she loved me and I love her. Rest easy Nan, tell Papa and Nick we love and miss them dearly.",
    "My son just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago. We always give kisses and hugs but I told him for awhile now that I don't want him to kiss me on the lips. I use the term inappropriate because it's the best way I know how to put it for him to understand. He sees me kiss my husband tonight and he said that I shouldn't kiss daddy on the lips. I explained that because mommy and daddy are husband and wife that it's okay. I told him that if he ever gets a wife, he can kiss her on the lips too. And he simply said \"or him\". I told him that is exactly right. He can love whoever he loves. I'm so proud that he even thought to say that because he has been around a few trans people but never a gay couple before. Love is love little dude. ❤",
    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "The depersonalisation/derealization is increasing. Ive been mentally ill since i was 13, im now 23. The worst its ever been was in 2016/2017, and now its coming back severely. In 2017 i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, but my psychiatrists evaluation was short and he suspected schizophrenic psychosis as well. In other words schizoaffective disorder. I have a lot of trauma and cptsd symptoms. Ive painted since i was 5, and i cant describe with words all of the fantasy and creativity i have stuck inside my head. My paintings went from realism mixed with surrealism and now an increase in surrealism because of my dreams. I dont relate to most in my age and it makes me lonely and isolated. Most people dont percieve the world like i do even though i know there are some out there. But i cant find them. As im writing this im experiencing deja vu. I remember writing this before. I can see into the future but no one would believe me if i told them even though i can even prove it sometimes. I feel like i might not make it past 30 and i feel like this world is more of an illusion than we like to admit, but it doesnt matter. Im just exhausted and i dont know what to do.

    "So I’m terribly , horridly , confused about my sexuality . I’m a very very curious person by nature . I’m curious about everything . I’m a 17 year old girl in a homophobic family if that’s relevant . However , my friends and schools have always been very friendly and I’ve never been told that gay people were wrong by them . Lots of my friends have been bi , and it’s made me curious . I’ve fantasized about girls when I was 14, and these fantasies were sexual in nature. I had “crushes” on girls though idk if I should call them that . It was more being shocked at their beauty , and kinda fantasizing about them . Although if I ever had to date a girl I’d pass . Kissing a girl seems interesting but not desirable . I’d do it out of curiosity idk if I’d legitimately like them . When I was around that age , I’d wanted to be gay . Like I know how weird that sounds but I’ve had pretty bad experiences with boys . Lots of very poor male role models in my life , and my mom is pretty anti guys and tells me how awful all men are , when I was growing up . Some lesbians try to make themselves like men and even marry one right ? Could the same thing happen in reverse ? Fake attraction fueled by desperation. As of now , I find women beautiful the way flowers are , its aesthetic . My “crush” was extremely beautiful but I wouldn’t do anything with her not really . I’m so confused .",
    "\"We knew that fans were hungry for more Survivor--and so were we. We looked at this group of players and thought, 'these guys came ready to play.' And as always, we have to stay a step ahead of them. So we decided, let's put the game on fast-forward. 'You think you can take your time figuring out your strategy and looking for idols? Think again. Everybody else is talking and somebody already found the idol. And if you blink, you're voted out.' I think it's the natural evolution of the game. The last few seasons, every single vote is complex. Every single Tribal Council, the gameplay is aggressive and has consequences. So this is almost a response to that. 'You wanna play hard from the beginning? Got it. We'll make it harder.'\"",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

My mom decided to move back in with my stepdad in there house. I told her I was going to cancel the couch because she does not need it since she’s moving back in with my stepdad. does that make me wrong?

    "so Im 21.  My friends are all my age or younger and we are in our 3rd year of college.  They LOVE to drink.  I have since fallen back from drinking, and that has made me realize that I have little to nothing in common with them.  I like my friends a lot, but recently I noticed they tend to ignore my invites to do things that dont involve going to booze late at night.  Even normal, fun things that most people would like to do they arent interested in and will ignore my offer.  I get liking to drink, but holy fuck it seems like its their whole life purpose to get drunk.  This is a very hard time to meet new people as well, so I kinda just feel lost.  When i talk to them sober/when were not drinking and partying our conversations suuuuuuuuck.  Its like I just met them but these are people ive known for 2+ years.  I got a job on the weekends, and so far Ive had more fun at work with my coworkers than I have with my friends.  It sucks.  Its so stupid that society expects college kids to all be wild, unhinged, borderline alcoholics.  Thats how they justify their near every day drinking, and they can never just have a couple its always about getting drunk.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, but I just needed to vent.",

Anyways, there was one guy who insisted on waiting until I was finished with my combo. There is no battle phase on my turn one, so after performing actions, I'd ask if he has a response and he'd say no. Ok, my board is set and I end on Bow Wow and one Prank Kid. He allows me to set backrow. I declare End Phase and he says he Nibs me at the end of my Main Phase. Can he do that, I gave him several chances within the main phase even after I completed my combo? The game ended up coming to a draw due to time and I feel like that Nib impacted the game more than it should've. I could also just be dumb, bust some clarification would be nice anyways.",

I've also seen examples of more extravagant craft, with long term thermal energy conversion generators, fully encrypted communication suites, ECM, small arms lockers, hazard suits, shields/armor, fabricators, and other equipment to the point of being like small colony ships to eke out a living on a nearby world until eventual rescue.

    "So, I just wanted to make a little post about the condition of atheists and how it's like being one in this country. First of all, it's quite disheartening to see that literally most of your country's population loathes you for your opinions and lack of belief in religion. In most social media groups of our country atheists are seen as outcasts. Most of us here are closeted atheists since there's a pretty massive chance that our families won't take this matter well. Moreover, there have been a number of brutal murders of atheists whose \"fault\" was expressing their opinions, which lead to their demise. In my opinion, freedom of speech doesn't exist here and it's despairing being in a country where you can be murdered for your opinions.",

Então tipo, eu falei pra ela, que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas direito, a gente tem a necessidade de comer um doce de vez em quando. Aí ela ficou puta, começou falar que eu preferia os doces do que os amigos, e na real, pra mim os dois caminham lado a lado na vida. Se eu não como doce eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho amigos, eu me sinto sozinho, o que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money.

    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.

    "Reading a translation of Anabasis, I noticed that having escaped the Army of Artaxerxes, and made it through the Armenian mountain passes, the Ten Thousand encounter a reoccurring trope amongst the various Pontic peoples they encounter. There are multiple instances where the local villages flee their homes in the face of the oncoming army, and hole up in Strongholds/Citadels. From the book, it is my understanding that these are not populated settlements and are only occupied to wait out hostile forces. It also seems that they were built collectively between multiple villages rather than each village having its own small strong-point. What other sources, if any, reference this practice? Is there any evidence for these small strongholds? In the book, they are often taken by the greeks without a prolonged siege or any equipment so how sophisticated could they have been?",

    "I think that Isayama is an incredible writer, the manga as a whole is proof of that. But a lot of people have problems with this final arc, namely that a lot of characters get plot armor. I think this is because Isayama made Eren and the founding Titan way too overpowered. With how powerful Eren is, of course there's going to be some plot armor for those who oppose him. Like why can't he just use paths to stop every single person who opposes him in his tracks? The only logical explanation could be that he didn't want to, which I guess we will find out in 139. Still, I just really feel that Isayama made the FT too super powerful, and then of course still had to make a compelling final conflict so he had to nerf Eren in some way and give the Alliance some plot armor moments. I think if he had maybe written the Founding Titan to not be as powerful as it is this final conflict would be much better. I'd love some opinions",

When I was working out then I followed a 40/30/30 macro split on the SAD diet anyways I did achieve solid results only speaking on my physique aesthetically real nutrition was definitely lacking. Anyways I stopped working out a little over 2 years ago however 4 months after I stopped lifting I discovered the wfpb diet and have never looked back since. So currently since I’ve eaten right I have been able to maintain a low body fat also my job is physical so I do lift and I’m active physically from that. So I have a solid starting base I’m currently skinny with some muscle not a lot but there is some anyways I want to put on 5 to 10 pounds at the max without getting fat if possible I would like to stay lean. What would be the best way to go about this with a wfpb way of eating. Any help would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance guys.",

Doğa ana dedikleri şey budur belki de?",
    "It’s just something I’ve been thinking about recently. I’m currently a high school student and I feel like people glamorize not sleeping. Like, you’ll always see people talking about how they only got three hours of sleep, like is that supposed to be impressive? Is that supposed to be a good thing? You do realize you’re just telling people you can’t take care of yourself, right? I’ve even seen people get made fun of for sleeping the Recommended 8 hours. Personally I’m more impressed when somebody is able to get all their school work done AND maintain a balanced sleep schedule I have a lot of respect for those people. Is this just a thing at my school or it universal? I’ve seen this happening since like, 5th grade lol",
    "This is like day 5 and i woke up this morning with like no withdrawal symptoms and no cravings. I basically just took supplements, drank a lot of water and coffee, and smoked weed at night. Honestly i think the supplements are what helped the most I strongly encourage who ever is quitting to take ashwagandha, Htp-5, and Rhodiola Rosea Extract two of each twice a day. Its been giving me the biggest boosts of serotonin and as i did feel the withdrawal symptoms this dramatically reduced them. I’m telling you if you are struggling take these and you will feel soo much better. And also smoke weed or take CBD if you like, it kinda takes the edge off. But i like these supplements so much I’ll probably take them for a long time",
    "Missing 411 cases fascinate me in part because they really come closest to feeling like the closest real-life analogue to a Cthulhu-esque horror. In the Cthulhu books, these types of beings were portrayed as completely alien and unfathomable, like there is no way to understand their intentions or desires, they are just on another level entirely. They are also irresistibly powerful, mere humans have no hope of overpowering them or defeating them. In Missing 411 cases, we have no idea why this is done to people and what they get out of it, but there is a clear intelligence to which victims are taken, when they are taken, and how they are taken. Also, the entity responsible seems to have no constraints, taking people even from crowded areas and always being able to avoid being witnessed by other people or even security cameras. The implications of this phenomena are utterly terrifying and fascinating.",
    "I have a notes folder in my phone full of story ideas, most of them never get started but when they do they are so brief I don't know where to go with them. For example, I want to write a love story about two almost opposite girls who unexpectedly find themselves within each other in a small rural area. I want to guide the two through the trials and tribulations of being LGBTQ+ in a small school/place that isn't accepting. They will be together in secret, but people will eventually find out. I also want to make the story about them, and how they find each other and their story. I just don't know where to start. Right now I have about 600 words but I'm unhappy with it, It doesn't make much sense.",
    "i am extremely new to this game and decided to look up some guides on who should i play as a beginner and what you had to do in the game, i came across jungling which i found very appealing and wanted to try out and i buy master yi to begin because i saw in a video that he is a decent jungler and an overall easy character with a straightforward kit,  but i always no matter the amoount of guides on how to jungle or how to take less damage, i always find myself having extremly low health after doing just one camp or two and i sometimes even die when i try to do one more camp, so i need someone from here that has played the game before and has jungled before to give me a more in-deph explanation and strategies on what to do, thank you",
    "Hi guys, I drink them both coffee &amp; energy drinks on a daily basis but they never really get me hyped the way they work for others, I think I’ve just developed an addiction and thats why I drink them. I’ve never understood how people can get jittery and hyped from them. I used to think my tolerance was just high, because every day I’d have at least two cups of coffee, both with 6 shots of espresso and at least one big Monster / other energy drink and it would just make me yawn constantly &amp; I’d feel like I’m about to fall asleep. It does help me focus better but doesn’t do much energy wise, which sucks because I’m an athlete and I would love to have something to boost my trainings. Anyone else have that problem with caffeine? Any recommendations for what to drink instead? I talked to my doc and she said its common to get that reaction from caffeine but wouldn’t recommend me to consume anything that would make me more hyper and I get that, my mind is already running all the time but I have to train twice a day six times a week and my body could really use some sorta energy boost sometimes. Thanks guys, would love to hear about your experience with caffeine",
    "Were you ever afraid of the dark? Did your imagination conjure up a wide variety of potential threats that would have the added advantage of darkness as an ally? Remember covering your head with a blanket as though that would somehow provide an additional layer of protection no matter how minuscule. Maybe you could have just a little less fear by not knowing the assault was underway.  Remember how hollow your mother's words were when she said 'There's nothing to be afraid of'. When you were a little older, she then explained to you that the dark is just the absence of photons, remember how the fear just dissipated. What are we afraid of now? Death, oblivion, complete annihilation? How are these concepts different from nothing? Are you still afraid of nothing? Nothing is absolute. Are you still afraid of the absolute?

It's difficult to explain the full premise but there are about four cultures the player encounters that all have very exaggerated attributes of modern society that is supposed to get the player to question their own reality and recognize a lot of the strange and counterintuitive behaviors of humans. I need resources that relate to our lack of individuality, the limits of our perception, consumerism, mob mentality, how culture and upbringing shape our world view and opinions, and the negative emotions that cloud our judgement and beliefs.

    "I work at a fast food place running the fryer, and I used to work at one running the drive thru. The work is fast paced and bitter at times. People at the speaker have not only the whole menu, but the opportunity to ask questions about it to the employee at the register. Pulling up to the window and adding to your order messes up the flow for both the window worker and the cook. Now the people behind you have to wait longer while the cook drops extra food with no notice and the cashier has to ring you up again. You messed up the flow for the workers and you're making it inconvenient for other customers. And as we all know, annoyed or angry customers take it out on employees sometimes. Congratulations, your extra order of fries or your added sandwich makes it harder on everyone because you're indecisive. Fast food wage is not worth that nonsense, so please stop.",

The devs have only released small statements or have sent out bot sorry messages about the issue, there will be a one-off-mass restoration for the characters affected but when that will be no one knows. This restoration will only work if the gear they restore is exactly what we all had on before the wipes, just giving us random purples and golds will do all of us no good and will be like were still naked. At least cyberpunk was playable, and anthem only destroyed the system not the countless hours put into a save.

    "I’m serving in the military and the work cycle I have is staying in camp for a week and then having one week off. The country I live in requires all males to undergo mandatory military conscription for two years and I’m slightly more than one year into the military service. At this point I’m so sick of this mundane lifestyle in camp because I’m doing guard duty most of the time. I can sleep well at home during the one week off because I’m free from the military. However, every night before I have to enter the camp for work I just can’t fall asleep. I would only sleep for a maximum of four-five hours and on a bad night I don’t sleep at all. I have a few sleepless nights in camp as well. I do not know the exact reason what’s keeping me awake, but I suspect it’s because of the lack of enthusiasm I have for the military as it is just too boring. I’m only entering university next year so there’s absolutely no goalsto pursue during this period of time. I feel like I’m just wasting my life away now. I just want to sleep but I just hate my life in the military as there’s nothing to look forward to the next day and this keeps me from falling asleep.",

But the thing is, I'm a transguy, and it kind of makes me uncomfortable with how feminine it is. I don't really do stuffed animals, and recently attempted getting rid of an old pink cat squishmallow that I got from a friend a year or so back, and I told my ma about it the day before last, before I was given easter stuff. I mentioned that it was super girly, and was far too feminine for my liking and that I was going to try to give it to my SO. She mentioned that she had gotten me one, which had me backpedaling q u i c k. I feel super guilty about not being super fond of it, and don't get me wrong, it's adorable, and I truly appreciate the thought that went behind it, and she even mentioned it was pride themed due to the rainbows. But I realistically don't know what I'll do with it. I had my other one hidden, out if sight out of mind style, and these are kinda expensive. This one was $10 which may not seem like a lot, but it seems like a lot to me, and I know they could put that money to better use than having it sit in my closet.

    "Hey guys. I'm a second-year biochemistry major and I'm interested in pursuing pharmacology in grad school. However, I'm not sure if I'm taking the right path and would like some advice. Essentially, I switched from a BS in chemistry to biochemistry despite my fascination with organic synthesis. I did this because I believed understanding the chemistry of biological systems would be more beneficial in pursuing pharmacology in grad school. More than anything, I want to study psychedelic substances and how they affect the CNS, but I also would love to carry out the synthesis of psychoactive drugs in addition to studying their biomolecular mechanism of action. I want to do what Hamilton Morris does, and what Dr. David Nichols and Alexander Shulgin did. Did I make a mistake choosing biochem?

    "Recap: I fell like a rag doll on my foot and injured myself. Particularly I had a bruise on top and the sole of my foot that was very painful. My husband is a physician and agreed that my foot was fractured, but also agreed with redditors that it was a Lisfranc fracture and would need close observation. I cannot thank enough the kind advice about lisfranc fractures. The X-ray revealed it was indeed a Lisfranc fracture and would require casting to maintain immobility, as well as no weight bearing for many weeks. Unfortunately, because I have Axonal Charcot Marie Tooth, this was my good leg. So currently I am bed bound until I once again bear weight on this foot, if ever. Since my neurological decline has been so rapid, I am forced to remain immobile for the foreseeable future. Life just handed me all of the lemons at once like the world’s suckiest lottery prize. Overall though, I am stable and safe, so life could be worse. Thank you again for caring enough to offer your wonderful advice. I really appreciate it.",
    "Guys, I’m finally at 10 gpd down from 25-30. It’s taken a while but I’ve slowly tapered. However I feel like I’m stuck in limbo. 3 months ago 10 gpd would be unheard of for me and seemed like SUCH a small amount. Now that I’m here I realize that’s great and all, but I’m still taking 10 gpd. I want it to be less, I’m getting kind of fed up with how long this is taking, I’m not trying to take another 4 months to get off completely from 10 gpd. How did you guys feel when you were at 10? Am I close to the finish line? Not even close, still have a far ways to go? Anyone know how quickly I can be done by tapering ? I’m sure if I CT I would still experience WD, I feel it slightly each morning until I dose 1.5 grams. I’ve been using kratom for the past 6-7 years.",
    "Hi all. So I received an FX-8350 as a gift and I made an OK build with it. Though I made the absolute stupid mistake of using m5a78lm-usb 3 motherboard from ASUS which have horrible VRMS and therefore when using the 8350 with this motherboard, it throttles the performance as soon as it hits 60° or above 50% usage. I decided that I will save up to buy the Asus M5A97 EVO R2.0... should I buy a different motherboard coz I don't want to make the same mistake. Also, cause the 8350 is basically a room heater, I decided that I might spend extra on the thermal grizzly conductonaut. But then the product page says not to use this paste with aluminium heatsink. Does anyone know if the 8350 has an aluminium heatsink?. Thanks.",
    "I always thought of sweet water as a circle. It evaporates, it rains, it is absorbed and used...  somehow in this process it changes state of aggregation and location but is not necessarily reduced in quantity, or is it? I understand that there is some amount of sweet water that is polluted in a way it cannot be cleaned anymore. Are those significant amounts? Is the amount of sweet water at a world level actually decreasing in significant amounts? If yes, where does it go? When we are told to save water is it to prevent water from being \"wasted\" because by using it somehow we decrease the amount of times it can be reused or for other reasons? Which ones? Or is there actually enough sweet water on a world scale and it is a allocation problem and not one of quantity?",

It’s so lonely with no gf and when i realized I couldn’t get one involuntarily when I was 16 I knew then thati would have a hard time.

I do notice sometimes that I get brief intense shooting itching sensations on my thighs and very mild itching and redness on my genitals, wondering if these are just very mild outbreaks or psychosomatic symptoms. My doctors insist that outbreaks are obvious but I’ve seen in some studies that “asymptomatic”carriers just don’t realize when they’re having outbreaks. Anyone else have mild outbreaks or am I trippin? Tempted to get a swab to see if I’m shedding but there aren’t any blisters or bumps. I wish there were at home swab tests so I could do it regularly and get an idea of how often I shed, my partner is negative so far but now that I know my results I’ve been feeling guilty.",

    "Why do girls and women ever post there? Almost all comments are sexual or creepy/pervy, or just mean. Not funny. So many also get a ton of unpleasant, at best, PMS. Why do we do this? Seriously. Guys will humiliate and be mean but why do girls and women subject themselves to this? Not blaming the girls/women but most posts end up with the same types of comments from misogynistic people. The guys posting there get funny comments and are not met with uncreative, mean insults. Especially when conventionally \"pretty\" girls or women post the comments are so much meaner. Dear girls and women please reconsider. Also I have a feeling that the amount of porn these boys and men watch make it impossible to see a photo of a girl/woman and not sexualize it.",
    "I don’t know how exactly to explain this, but when I was little, I used to get these breathing “bursts.” What I mean by that is there were times when I would breath in as if to take a deep breath, but instead of a normal deep breath it felt like I was breathing in happiness. Bare with me I know this sounds crazy. This was a feeling of all over calming, clean, comforting, burst of I don’t know what to call it. It would happen at different times like while was playing or other random times. It would happen maybe a couple of times a week from what I remember. All I know is that it happened regularly throughout my childhood but stopped sometime before my teen years. I’ve never felt it again. I think of this from time to time and wonder if maybe it was some sort of spiritual experience. I really don’t know but I’ve never met anyone else who has experienced this. Any thoughts? Any similar experiences???",
    "I'm late to it, but I just watched Netflix's I Am a Killer: Released. Basically, Dale Sigler did 30 years for shooting Subway employee John William Zeltner Jr to death during a robbery. He has been paroled, and now repeatedly asserts that he did it because John \"tried to blackmail him into having a homosexual relationship \", although nothing like that was presented at trial.Afterwards,  I searched posts about it to read about posters wanting to empathize or questioning if they should pity Dale. I had the exact opposite reaction. I was totally disgusted by his repeated use of homophobic sentiment to reframe himself as a victim. I get the impression he's using religion as something to create a new facade for himself. He clearly doesn't take responsibility for what he did, and when he speaks, it's as if some important piece of humanity is missing behind his eyes. I also noticed Albino Legend,, a white supremacy tattoo, on his hands.I realize much of my reaction was based on personal impressions. I do believe in second chances, but frankly,  I found it shocking how quickly this community seems to embrace him. He's taken in by a complete stranger and parishioners nod encouragingly when he tells his new reason for the killing. I'd have great trepidation about this person reoffending.

    "When anyone tries to get you to discount your internal truth in favor of what they’re trying to convince you is true, you can either betray yourself or honor yourself. No abuser ever tells their victims, “I’m here to abuse you.” Instead, they always try to win the trust of their victims by convincing them that what they’re trying to do to them is in their best interest. Socialists are abusers. Period. 100% of examples throughout history validate this. That ain’t gonna change no matter how much you like AOC’s underdog story.  Social media and big tech are trying to deceive you into being abused and believing it’s in your best interest because they care. I don’t know about you, but I choose to see it for what it is.

    "I realised today that we never actually got the love we deserved from our parents. I used to convince myself that “they weren’t that bad” and the love bombing stages made me think it was just “normal fighting” but it’s not. I grew up bullied as well and so neither school or home was my safe space which was the reason I read so much and threw myself into fictional worlds. Maladaptive daydreaming was my escape. It’s only recently that I have a healthy bunch of friends that I can say they’re my safe space especially since I still live with my parents but it’s a punch in the gut to think the people who are supposed to give you that unconditional healthy love that you can rely on and always come home to gave us the kind of love we have to spend the rest of our lives trying to unlearn and escape From. It’s incredibly damaging because then we tend to seek that healthy love in our romantic relationships and friendships to make up for what we never got as kids. We’re not supposed to seek it out like that it was supposed to been given to us by our parents but they never did. It’s hard to admit being unloved but that’s what it is.",

Like I know they probably explain later on in the story but I just can't even be bothered, second, why tf would they skip so much? They should of made a direct sequel to wolfenstein 2, why did they think skipping like 20 years was good? Wheres all the characters I know and love? And to be calling this Canon? Ruins everything, why is it online? Has no one learned from fallout 76? You cant take a beloved series and then make a online game, maybe if it was a spin off game I could maybe tolerate it, atleast with fallout 76 I can tolerate it, but not this, this is a mistake, I could care less about, what was there names? Soph and jess? I think? I just want to keep fighting the nazi's and expand the rebellion and kick ass as BJ, it's just so sad, I love wolfenstein TNO and 2 and when you take away the main character along with the people I actually care about, you ruin the game series, it makes me sad because I know truly believe that they cannot fix this, if I had a time machine I would go back in time and stop them from making a wolfenstein game 20 years or whatever in the future from the last game, what are your thoughts on this horrible game?",

    "I ordered the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G 512 GB in color Phantom Black originally back on March 2, 2021 from AT&amp;T. I finally received it on April 8 2021. I waited a very long time to get this particular model and I only found out about a delay because of chip shortages from Reddit. First of all to even remove the expandable memory slot and then have customers have to wait a lengthy amount of time for their order because they choose the 512GB version is insane. My cellphone carrier kept saying it was coming... it will be there in a couple of days etc. for the entire time. I told myself once I get it I will post it on Reddit  just so maybe I can end some frustration for anyone else waiting for their order.  The one good thing that I can say however is that I love this phone. It did not disappoint. I had used the Samsung Galaxy Note phones for at least 6 or 7 years. It was hard to get me away from the Note versions, had my Samsung Note 9 for the a little over 2 years. I had a lot of wear and tear on my phone so I did a lot if research to narrow down my next cellphone purchase choice. I am so glad I decided to get a different version this time. Samsung cellphones are my go to brand and will continue to be in the future. The Samsung Galaxy Ultra 5G phone is a definite winner. So many pros and a few cons but the features and specs are remarkable so I will no doubt recommend this brand to anyone who wants to purchase a new cellphone in the near future.",

I’ve only been here since the beginning of February but honestly the shitty scheduling and lack of work/life balance no matter how many times I bring up how I need less hours because I’m in school is just too much. I also have not felt like my store is a “safe space” for me, as I’m visibly not straight or cisgender and my coworkers as well as customers have been clocking me for it or talk about me behind my back and it’s really wearing me down and makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. I’d like to quit and preferably not have to physically hand a notice in or stay a full two weeks.

About a year ago, I got the urge to recover so we started grocery shopping together and eating our meals together. However, I relapsed shortly after and I’ve been restricting every day again. And though she’s never had issues with her eating patterns before, she’s now restricting with me. I never see her eating unless I’m eating too and if she says she’s hungry but I choose not to eat, she will change her mind as well. She’s also been working out more frequently and mentioning how much weight she’s losing. It’s added a ridiculous new amount of pressure on me because I feel like I’m being forced to recover in order to prevent her from getting sick. Does anyone relate??",

    "I’ve been listening to kpop for 3 years now and I never really watched kdramas up until last year well technically I have but only seen 3. The first one I watched was in 2019 and I never finished it and then I watched and finished two in 2020. My friend and everyone on the internet talks about the latest dramas some popular ones I’ve heard of is “what’s wrong with secretary kim” and “crash landing on you.” I guess when I got into kpop I was mainly focused on kpop so I never took the time to actually watch kdramas and I still don’t  to this day. I’ve seen stuff about how some people like for dramas to take their time with the plot and that it catches them off guard when things move to fast. And I feel like that’s why I don’t watch them because I get bored easily and if it takes to long to get to the point I’m not gonna finish it.

    "Honestly people who are gay Christians need to stop going through loop holes to try to not make homosexuality a sin in Christianity. The Bible has about six passages in which it can be taken as condemning homosexuality. I’m not arguing that Christians should attack gay people but I believe not calling it a sin in the Bible is off at best and disingenuous at worst. EVERY single verse is a mistranslation or has an alternative reasoning? And even if that was true most of the early church didn’t agree homosexuality wasn’t sinful. I think a better way to think is “the Bible says this but I still believe in God” or “I don’t care if being gay is a sin but I’m still a Christian” but throwing shotty reasoning isn’t doing you or anybody else any justice.",

    "I have been looking for RAM for MONTHS. I ordered some back in January and it is still backordered and my attempts to find some elsewhere have turned up empty.

I initially found some for around $140 a stick but while it has been on backorder the price has gone up $50 and the site doesn't lock in your price. So it will cost me $200 more than planned. I have on occasion found some RAM but only at $200+ a stick. I don't specifically need that model of RAM.

    "For a little over a month now, I’ve had these pressure/headaches on the left side of my head only. The pressure moves. Sometimes it is below my eye, sometimes in my upper jaw/cheek, sometimes below my eyebrow, on my eyebrow, temple, behind the ear, above the ear, and on the side of my head. When it first started, I saw my doctor and he said he saw fluid in my ear, which meant infection, and gave me an antibiotic. It didn’t help. He said it is allergy related and told me to take allergy meds, so I’ve also been doing a nasal spray and allergy med every day. Allegra until I ran out, now just an Amazon generic 10 mg. I went back, and he ordered a CT scan. He said CT scan showed “thickening” of the sinuses behind my eye and prescribed Amitriptyline, which has done nothing but make my heart race. I can’t even find anything online about that med and sinuses. This has been more than a month, the pain isn’t more than a 2-4 on the pain scale, but it’s exhausting. The only other allergy symptoms I have are drainage and sneezing. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to relieve it if so?",
    "every aspect of my life is determined by what other people want and how i can make them happy. i have terrible social anxiety so to compensate for it i focused on trying to do everything i could to not make other people uncomfortable, but i feel like i'm overly aware of it. i can't talk to people because i worry i might make them uncomfortable by it, even my closest friend. i can't make decisions because i don't want to upset or inconvenience other people because of it. hell i'm only still alive because other people would be upset. what's the point of living if it's entirely for others? people say \"think of the things that make you happy\", but i just can't pinpoint what legitimately makes me happy versus hobbies i adopted for other people. i live for a validation i have never and will never receive, and i fucking hate it.",
    "My mom found out of my eating disorder on my birthday in November and she then told my whole family, which embarrassed me. I've been struggling with bulimia since I was a pre-teen and before that, I had stopped eating and lost a lot of weight. But my whole family is insensitive to my feelings and I have to lie and say that I'm getting better. When I'm sad, my mom keeps telling me that I'm trying to be depressed, which is very insensitive. She thinks that it's easy to recover from something so traumatic for me. She also says that if she sends me to counseling or therapy, I'll have to eat 2000 calories per day. so I was wondering how therapy is because the last two years, I've never felt so low before. Thank you and have a nice day.",
    "So I went to elementary school and middle school in this one school district and I found it easy to make friends and I was always the top of my grade, the classes feeling super easy. But for high school my parents made me switch to another school district as their high school was one of the best in the state with lots of resources. The thing is, I would say I’m doing pretty well but the culture there is so that everyone tries so hard and it feels like everyone that I know has started their own club or community service while ranking highly in other clubs and sports and on top of that about 20 aps at the end of their senior year. I searched this up and apparently you are heavily compared to people at your high school. Right now I would say I’m on track to do the many aps but not much community service/clubs or anything to make me stand out. I know at my last school district this would already be super impressive and now that I’m already going to be a Junior I feel very lost and worried that I might’ve made a life changing mistake by switching schools. I still have friends from my last school district and O hear so many people getting into great schools with such little effort while I’m busting my butt off with like full aps and not even able to stand out because I don’t have the work ethic to go even further than that.",
    "So don't tell me where I heard it. It's a looooong story, kinda like a mystery. The Developer is coming back soon, and there's going to a massive update, some patches, and huge improvements to the main server. He's the one who is the mod of the multiverse, but he stepped down for a bit cuz one of his AI's said they could do a better job. The the current gameplay was kind of a troubleshooting phase, so that's what dark energy and dark matter is about. Anyways, you wouldn't understand the whole story even if I explained it to you. But don't worry, the patch will come with hidden lore, new abilities, a variety of experiences, etc. Get ready, this is going to be big. Bu the way. The Developer's wife has been conducting a survey. I swear they don't want you to buy anything, just do whatever the hell you want and respect one another, and don't fking troll. It gets annoying.",
    "I purchased Nordick track x32i, almost a 4K Machine, with $199 Shipping costs. The shipping team insisted they have to place the treadmill in the garage, citing COVID reasons. We had to lift heavy equipment and assemble it ourselves even though we paid hefty price for shipping. The screen and everything turned on after we assembled it in our first floor, but the belt doesn't run no matter what speed is selected. I reached out to the customer service with in a week of delivery and they were not helpful at all. They pretended they did not understand which seems to be a common problem with the treadmill and try to find excuses not to address the faulty machine. They went to extent of making me send pics of where the machine was set up claiming they won't cover it if its still in the garage, to begin with they insisted to place it there. Fortunately we had no room in the garage and we had to set up in our recreation room. I sent the pictures with a fraction of second and they disappeared on me. What kind of service is this? They start conversation with anything they can do to escape servicing you. Dont' they run tests on machines that are being delivered? Anyone with terrible experience as me?",
    "Hello folks - I am 43 with an MBA and am a Program Manager. I make a very good income but would like to slowly get to a point where I could pursue early retirement at 50. My definition of early retirement is to have flexibility in pursuing my interests. I am open to choosing a second career where I have this flexibility. I have an undergraduate degree in Engineering. I love building things. As examples I installed recessed lighting in my home, built my own theater in my home, build a backyard playset for my kids. I am wondering if pursuing something like HVAC technician or electrician or plumbing on the side can help proper a second career. Can someone advise what are meaningful second career opportunities to pursue?",

If they make the alberto slower than that thing they're moronic to the highest degree and if they make magy stronger than it should be and faster than it should be they're also moronic as that would be conceptually ridiculous, I said the devs should've had the foresight to see magys biggest problems but with a name like Afterthoughts I take that back as they're really living up to that name, fact is it should've been replace by Amargasaurus or Shunosaurus.",
    "Apologizes for all my recent posts to this sub lately. Found out today that I failed AUD with a 71. On test day I woke up feeling extremely foggy and mentally unfocused, and I feel like this is a large reason why I failed. The testing centers near me have openings next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, so I’m heavily contemplating retaking the exam next week. Would studying full time between now and next Wednesday/Thursday be enough for a pass? Not sure if I should put my all into studying for the next 6-7 days and try to schedule a retake next week, or if I should take my time and schedule it for a few weeks out. I feel like all of the information is still very fresh in my mind, which is why I kind of have this need to take it immediately. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "I’ve had unexplained severe abdominal pains that have landed me in emergency 3 times. They are so bad so chronic and severe that I’ve ended up on oxycodone and pregabalin for pain. I know it sounds crazy but in the search for answers I discovered a slipped disc and got the neurosurgeon to prescribe me dihydrocodeine as I’d previously used codeine paracetamol I had lying in the house from another family member. I’m doing a stool test with a naturopath on Monday that tests for everything including SIBO SIFO And H.Pylori . My question is has anyone had abdominal pains that are cruel and torture me to death. With the continuing feeling that I have a fart or BM to pass, have had this feeling 24/7 for 8 months and it’s torturing. Even the pain killers don’t help as much anymore.",
    "We call ourselves the generation of change, but I feel like we are a scam. We are meant to be the generation which shows the others how to be respectable people, but how the hell are we meant to be the “superior” generation if you are making fun over a recently deceased man? Prince Phillip created the wwf for gods sake, which last I checked is a charity trying to prevent animals becoming extinct. He was a man who fought for change in the past which shaped our present, and frankly without him, we wouldn’t be where we are today. I know he isn’t perfect, by any means, and it is inevitable somebody will comment about how he was, but 10 minutes after it was announced he died, a tonne of memes came out. I’m ashamed over how fast the memes are, and the fact that people are there saying “thank god he is dead” clearly have no respect. Most of the memes I’ve seen are from gen z, and it makes me ashamed to be a part of this generation.",

I called him hitler, and he replied with “hitler was a republican, I am a democrat is side with the left”. Hitler. Republican. Excuse me? But it doesn’t end there, ladies and gentlemen, I respond with “hitler was a nazi”. He says that anyone who apposes the left is a nazi so that makes him the same as a republican. I said that not everyone who apposes him is a nazi, and he replied with “that’s why we need to imprison everyone who disagrees with the left first because they are the violent ones who want to kill us.” What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People? Better watch out, this guy is gonna run for president and imprison every “nazi” so that it is only pure people with his beliefs. And it’s not only the fact that he was calling everyone a nazi, it was the fact that the dude was saying he was gonna do exactly why hitler did.

    "Hi, I am a female in college and the last relationship that I was in he constantly struggled to stay hard during sex. He said it was because he was always nervous around me or had been drinking too much and I believed him then, but now I have hooked up with quite a few people since then and more than half of them have also had this problem with me. They either cannot finish at all or I have to give them a BJ for them to stay erect. Is there something I could consistently be doing wrong? I always ask when this happens if there's something they want me to do differently, but I am always reassured that it isn't me, but its happened too many time for me to believe that now haha. Is this problem more common than I thought with guys in their early 20's? Or is there something girls do during sex that would cause this to happen that I could possibly be doing?",

    "So it takes a good 30 minutes or so to get a decent base up and supply it with resources, it takes a bastion 1 minute to fly over it and destroy it in a quick drive by shooting. Whats the point anymore? Add in the rapidly rotating continents where alerts are triggered within the first 30 minutes of a continent opening these days, putting effort into creating a nice base feels like a total wasted effort. The whole system could be so much better with some changes. Some sort of system that adds persistence to bases after continent lock would be nice for example, the game really could use some form of persistence like that, as it stands now its just a never ending cycle of continent locks and alerts with no real long term meaning. The durability of bases could really use some balance changes as well, its just too ridiculously easy to destroy them compared to the time investment required to set a nice one up.",

I drive the speed limit at all times no matter what because I'm neurotic and cannot afford to get pulled over and have my car insurance increase. So obviously people pass me constantly. Almost every car that ends up behind me. I'm not stupid so I've inferred that people don't drive the speed limit so I should be at traffics speed, and I must be annoying. Sorry to anyone that I've inconvenienced. I just don't understand the point of having posted speed limits that no one follows yet you can still legally get pulled over and ticketed for not following them. I'm genuinely confused if this is an unspoken rule that everyone understands and I'm just not in the loop. Why do we need to go so fast anyway? What's the rush guys???",

That's why I thought that I could take AP stats over the summer of Junior year at Johns Hopkins CTY to give me one more course. However, I realized that I'm also gonna be pretty busy this year with writing my essays and retaking my SAT, but at the same time, another AP might help, I don't know for sure.

    "Available for the first time on vinyl is the complete OLYMPIA THEATRE, PARIS, FRANCE 5/3/72 show from the Grateful Dead’s legendary Europe ‘72 Tour. Of the twenty-two performances on the famed Europe '72 tour, the first night in Paris on 5/3/72 has always been considered one of the best. This is proven by the fact that four songs from this concert were included on the seventeen-track, seminal platinum-selling Europe '72 album. The performance also includes five songs sung by Pigpen on what would be his final tour, including a massive “Good Lovin',” which allows Pigpen to do what he does best: hold the audience in the palm of his hand while they hang on his every word.

Seriously. I am currently all in on AMC, but just today I was thinking of buying some GME. I truly believe and have seen exceptional DD that GME is gonna run up really fucking high. I think that big price jump in January was  not the actual squeeze but an artificially inflated price to get people to sell. And it worked. Just my opinion. Not financial advice. You can’t go wrong either way. Just read a bit more because GME may just be further along than AMC and very well could pull the truly big numbers sooner.",

I tend to work 2-3 months at a time and take a month or two to live off my savings and unemployment before going back to work to re up on money.

Now it doesn't really bother me if they have a handful of clothes that's fine, but if they just toss a whole pile of clothes and don't sort them or anything, it just gets on my nerves. Do they not realize how long it's gonna take to remove like 30 fucking hangers, and that it's literally holding up EVERYONE ELSE in line???? What makes it worse is that people usually put their clothes up last, so as I'm scanning everything else, they have time to at least take SOME hangers off instead of just dropping a big pile on me. Shout-outs to the customers who actually remove the hangers beforehand or before I start scanning them, it genuinely saves me so much time",

It would be fun to see the convoy stop at monuments and have a squad of scientist disembark as well as one manning the 50 on the M-ATV and having players assault it. Even cooler would be the ability to ambush the convoy with HV rockets and land mines to get a one up on the Scientist. It would be interesting to see what new gameplay this would create as you would have an event constantly roaming around the map unlike the Bradley at Launch every encounter with this convoy will be different",
    "As i watched the show, i began to notice something very unique that this show has that not too many other do. It has amazing writing and character development. I just LIVE how it isnt focused on a single main character, the show tends to branch out and give each character at least 1 amazing and impactful story of their own. Admittedly, the first season was mainly centered around Q, but the rest of the seasons were perfectly and beautifully spread out between the characters, allowing for amazing development and backstory growth for each one. And not only do they give each character their own amazing story, but they blend them all in together soooo well. For the writing, i just gotta say one thing: Margo. I cant tell you how many times i laughed at some of the things she has said. This show is a perfect example of how shows should be.

    "Hi guys and gals. I was doing my morning meditation and at the end of it a thought popped into my head \"why did it take me so long to quit kratom despite the nightmare i was living in daily?\". I used for 2 years everyday, 10-30gpd...sometimes more. I came to the conclusion that i was so use to feeling like absolute shit after taking kratom that i became subconsciously attached to that world because it was all i knew. If you're \"afraid\" to quit...don't be. Why? Because kratom already makes you feel like absolute shit....otherwise you wouldn't be on this sub wanting to quit. Will the withdrawals and paws be worse than how you feel now? It's a matter of how you perceive it. Here's the thing...you know exactly what taking kratom leads you to....more and more and more....it's never enough. Like a monster that needs to be constantly fed. All the while you still feel like shit. Here's the thing that quitting it leads you to....getting your life back, feeling emotions besides fear and anxiety again, your physical and mental health returning, your joy, compassion, gratitude, and happiness. Is everything perfect and peachy after you quit....of course not. But the days you are feeling like shit, you can step back and know at least the next hour, week, month, or year could be different than how you feel after ingesting that green sludge. How bad do you want your life back? Is it worth a few weeks of feeling like shit compared to years? You know the answer. You're not alone. Stay strong...and if you need to reach out REACH OUT. I'll do anything i can to help",
    "Hi. I want help if anyone can spare a few words of encouragement. I wrote religious on the topic of this because I am kind of a religious. I grew up catholic and I don’t follow the church a lot but I do have faith. I’ve posted her before about how my dad treats me. I’m the oldest daughter and I feel like my mom and I are used as the scapegoat to why everything is horrible for my dad. Anyway, I feel alone a lot. I pray and I feel like no one is listening. Does anyone have some scripture or words of encouragement from the Bible? I sometimes feel like I am the one in the wrong because my dad uses God and my faith against me. Anything would be great. I am going to get a keepsake with the Virgin Mary on it to keep me safe and to remind myself she is there with me. Anyway, thank you to this group. It makes me feel less alone.",
    "Have these positions been eliminated in all Lowe's stores? I was hired as a Pro Electrical associate that included a higher quarterly bonus structure than regular floor associates get. I was informed at the end of last year that the Pro-Electrical and Pro- Plumbing positions have been eliminated and that my bonus would be reduced by quite a bit. This is a demotion that I did nothing to deserve. It is a reduction in my yearly compensation for the work I do. In the meantime, I am still doing all of the things for Pro Services that I had previously done, so the only difference in my work requirements is that I no longer have access to some of the abilities to control stock inventory as I used to. Just wondering if this was a store management decision or a corporate one.",
    "Can we all as a collective agree that huge maps ~~are bad~~ with only 1 area of interest are bad. The way their design is lacking. With only 1 point of interest if you don't get the good spawns for them then you your shit out off luck. Have fun clearing resort with gigga chads camping dark corners, and the infamous potted rats and don't get me started on woods oh god woods. If shoreline ever gets a face lift like customs just add more then just 1 area of interest and have future maps have more focus on form over function. Maybe add beach houses and touristy spots or maybe since we have a power station why not pair it with a water treatment plant with offices, a parking lot, and big silos. I'm not a game designer but this ain't it.",
    "We were talking about someone who was using substance abuse and I was shattered due to it and lost a night of sleep and was about to go into depression for a week. My therapist just calmly asked how my weekend was as usual, and I told it was not that great and he asked if I wanted to talk about it.. I just kept quiet and uttered, why don't you ask.. he closed everything and just quietly asked \"What happened that made you feel this way?\" And I instantly opened up and told it hurt me and I know it shouldn't have because my life is more important and I was learning in therapy how to become a better person. He just asked \"Are you sad about it?\" And I replied..\"not sad, disappointed, I don't want people to go down a bad path and others don't even understand it's not okay and support it and I always be the odd one out\". He just replied saying \"shouldn't\" is a strong word you used, it's fine to feel that way, you should take your time. He was like \"Trust me, you're just 21 now, by the time you're 27, you'll be the one who will have her life under control whereas they'd not and I that's because you understand well\". He also told me I don't fit it or isolate myself because I understand people too well and people mostly don't like it. I just perked up and told, \"So what? I love being this way\" and he was like yeah, that's important. The fact that we both understand each other so well makes me so happy that I can just sit and talk to him and forget that he's my therapist and just someone who I am comfortable with.",
    "We've all seen it time and time again.  Someone goes through a life saving medical procedure, or is rescued by brave EMS from harrowing situations, and their reaction once they recover is to thank God for working his magic and saving their life.  Advancements in medicine that helps struggling third world countries is \"God's work\".  He uses the hands of doctors and scientists to provide for his flock.  But now, in 2021, while going through the worst global pandemic in a hundred years, a vaccine comes out and Christians everywhere are fighting tooth and nail to demonize it.  What happened to \"God works in mysterious ways\"?  Sorry if this has been said a million times on this sub already, but I've recently been pleading with some family members to get vaccinated, and while they aren't specifically citing their religion for the reason behind it, it definitely seems to be stemming from their church.  Why are they now abandoning their blanket attributions of science to God.  We all know why, it's just crazy to me that they so easily forget their own logic.",
    "Let me start by saying I like oppressors. They’re fun, fun to use and to fight against.  I played this game when it came out, and took a hiatus for a few years, came back on ps4 in 2017 and there was a bunch of new stuff I didn’t care to grind up at the time.. I’ve been playing again for a few months and am working towards having all the shiny toys, my newest one being a khanjali I fully upgraded thinking it would be a decent swatter for the oppressors in an open lobby.. the aiming radius sucks and less than ten rockets kills the damn thing, I’m a little bummed out but not too discouraged. On foot I usually goad those guys into tight covered spaces and headshot them. Just wondering if any of you fine folks have any ground fighting tactics against oppressors you want to share",
    "Currently stuck on the glass bead milestone hard, from what I understand you need to find around 8 submerged ruins before you get given the horrific treasure. On my last play session I managed to get like 5 submerged ruins back to back via scanning with the nautilon but now for the past 10-15 oceans, on over 10 planets I havent been able to find a single one. Just an unlucky 3 hour dry streak? Or is there something im not getting. Because from what ive seen, the scanner radius is huge, some of the ruins it found for me were over 8 minutes of travel time away and im finding it hard to believe im simply not in range to locate any. Extremely frustrating as its one of the last milestones I need and I cant really find any information on it, or submerged ruins at all on youtube or the wiki, and my only option is just a crapshoot at landing on a random planets ocean, constructing a nautilon bay, scanning, finding absolutely nothing, rinse and repeat.",
    "We married young. Had a baby young. Both needed to do some major growing up. Played the back and forth game for years. Finally decided enough was enough. He left mine and our daughters lives. I have always said he's my soul mate. No doubt about it. But he had a drinking problem and needed to grow up. After years of looking for qualities he had in other men. I finally gave up and settled for a man who seemed to love me and my daughter We got pregnant less than 6 months into our relationship. We kept trying and eventually got married. My oldest wanted the same last name and asked to be adopted. My ex-husband agreed to do what he thought his daughter wanted. Current husband turned out to be a liar and master manipulator. Good dad but bad for me. I started seeing a therapist and realized I never have let go of my ex-husband and all the things I wanted to say she said I needed to talk to him or write him a letter. So I did. We talked and we talked and we talked. We both realized we have never been truly happy since we split. He's finally grown up and regrets his mistakes but can't do anything to change them. He only wants to make up for them. So we are here. I'm separated from my current husband and so completely in love with my ex-husband that it's unreal how right it feels.",
    "I played three games of Control tonight. The first match was a neck and neck struggle. It was difficult, but my team pulled ahead and won. Afterwards, teams were broken up and made more “fair”. My next two games were up against a sweaty 4 stack that fucked us and mercy ruled us 97-33. However teams were not changed and I was stuck against the same 4 stack the next round, despite the matchup being anything but fair. How the hell does this happen? Lately almost every game I have played has been much more unbalanced, but when it is a fair game that doesn’t end with Shaxx pitying us, the matchmaking says “Fuck you” before throwing me into a awful sweat fest that make me regret even picking up the controller.",
    "I have to reread a book I hated . I read this book maybe 5 years ago and I don't remember the plot much but I do remember the main character's father and one of her sisters. The father is some noble guy who can't marry the Mc's mother because she is a lower class ,so instead he never married her or found a solution and just became husband and wife in everything but name. He is a general / commander and when his friend/ leader died  they do this tradition where they cannot eat or drink anything but bread or water for a week I think. He forces his pregnant \"wife\" to do this tradition even though the tradition usually allows  pregnant people to  skip it.  Her youngest  sister has a club foot too.  Something happens in the book where ,he decides to leave his family to officially marry someone else and this is a character defining moment for the MC since her father is a dick.",
    "I got a monstera clipping from a friend, potted it and put it next to my sliding glass door that got several hours of bright sunlight. I had it there for about a year and not much happened. It grew 1 or 2 new leaves that stayed really small. I moved it outside where it got about 3 or 4 hours of direct sun a day. It grew super fast and got really big. I recently moved to a new place where there’s no room for it inside so I kept it outside. However now it gets direct sunlight almost all day. Everything I read about monsteras is that they will burn in direct sun, so I’m worried about summer coming and having almost no shade. Does anyone else have a monstera that loves direct sun? Or am I about to kill my plant?",

    "Our friend accidentally caught an adult Banded Water Snake while fishing, and the poor snake got injured by the fish hook. We removed the hook from the snake’s side, and I handled the snake to make sure he was okay and calm. We did not have any iodine or the proper equipment to treat his wound, but thankfully the hook didn’t puncture any vital organs. I put him around my neck and shoulders while carrying him back down to the lake, and my friend took a photo of me with the snake around my neck, and then posted it on Facebook before we let the snake go. The comments on the Facebook post were ignorant and ridiculous. People were saying “he has a death wish. That’s a water moccasin.” Or “it looks fully evil”. First off, it was NOT a water moccasin. The snake had round pupils and was not aggressive, and I’m experienced enough to know what snake is what. I definitely would not free handle a venomous snake. Some people are idiots and should really get educated before trying to put their two cents in. The snake was completely harmless. I wanted to treat his wounds before letting him go back into the wild, but he swam away just fine.",

    "I came up with some good chorus lyrics for a song I want to write but my brain immediately created some stupid melody for them that isn't even good and now I can't break out of it. Every time I try and write some lyrics  my brain's goal is to conform to this rhythm and it's blocking me from being able to express myself. I found a better melody but that didn't help because now I can't break out of THAT one. I just want to write some words and THEN come up with the melody, but because I'm stuck in this one, I can't come up with any words. I tried writing it down as a poem instead of a song but still I just can't stop that melody and rhythm circling in my head. I tried playing some other melody and writing to that but that didn't work either. Any ideas? Lol",
    "Obviously Attila predates our modern understanding of \"conservative\" or \"right wing\" by thousands of years, but I'm still quite confused. As you may recall, last year, Kelly Loeffler ran a campaign ad in which she claimed to be \"more conservative then Attila the Hun.\" This confused me, as I'd never heard anything about Attila being particularly conservative; I also just read a Donald Trump quote from the 2000 election cycle, in which he said, \"I'm on the conservative side, but Buchanan is Attila the Hun.\" Hearing two comparisons of conservatives to Attila the Hun has just left me confused, so I came here to ask anyone who can answer: was Attila the Hun especially conservative? Enough so to warrant these hyperbolic comparisons?",

Apparently it's better to pot them in those biodegradable pots and leave them indoors until they grow about 6 inches then replant them. My problem with this is that I can't do it in my house and have to do it in a treehouse instead, there's a fair amount of light but not as much as a house window due to the tree cover, it has insulation and double glazed windows but the temperature still drops overnight.

    "My Xbox One S has been sent back to Microsoft in the past and was \"fixed\" but now the problems are even worse. Games flat out won't start, so pretty much every time I want to play a game I have to hard reset the console and wait to see if that worked, which it usually doesn't. If it does work then only a certain few games work and only if the console wants to let me play that day. It's totally random when the console wants to work so it usually just doesn't. If a game will even load it will eventually boot me back to the home screen and show an error message saying \"for some reason your game took too long to load\" and then I'll restart the process. Microsoft won't do anything other than suggest I try to send it in for repair which costs about $175 or just buy a new one since it's no longer under warranty.  I have literally tried every troubleshooting piece of advice Microsoft will give since I've called about 10 times. Thinking this may be internal hardware issue maybe?

    "So I’ve been pretty excited with all the Disney Villainous expansions that we have gotten and will get but I’m kinda curious if Ravensburger have future plans on doing Pixar Villainous. Since Disney owns Pixar I was thinking it would be really cool to see they’re take on how the Pixar Villains will win. Obviously I feel there’s a few Villains for I think would be really amazing to see. For example, Mister Waternoose from Monsters Inc. His goal could be literally be to scare Boo enough times to fill up a certain number of canisters with her screams, as well as having ally cards be Randal and other scare monsters from the floor. Also it would be cool to give Hopper from Bug’s Life a chance to throw down. As we known he’s main goal is to make the worker ants bring him enough food to survive the winter. It would be pretty cool to see how the circus troop play out against him in the game. Another villain that would be interesting to see from Pixar universe is AUTO from WALL-E. I love WALL-E and and nothing would scream crazy villain like an ai computer forcing the main kind to be lazy and to give up on returning back to earth. AUTO goal could be to obtain the plant and try to destroy it. Ideally there are many villains that could appear if they ever did a Pixar edition to of Disney Villainous, but will we ever see it come to fruition? Who would you think would be interesting to see from the Pixar world entering into the Villainous board game world?",

Then once I go to clean I am locked in focus, because if someone distracts me with a different task, like if my mom asks me to vacuum out the car while I’m getting ready to clean, I’ll have to vacuum at the car, then take another 15, 30 minutes scrolling through social media or something to re-excite myself and re-energize my brain before I go clean.

When she went for her second shot she was told her name wasn't in the system, but she had her vaccine card from her first appointment and they said they'll manually enter her second and all should be fine. Now when she searches the system on the app for proof of being vaccinated, it comes up empty. She has her paper vaccine card but she loses things easily and it would be best to have the pass on her phone. Anyone else have an issue with retrieving their pass? Or know of a solution?

    "I have to say, I haven’t ever gotten into reading quite like this, this series comes pretty close to my favorite book series Ready Player One, and might even overtake it. I just have never read a series with so much action in little romance, yet still incredibly wholesome. The last few months spent on the light novel have been absolutely amazing, and I’m so glad I decided to read past the current point in the manhwa. The side stories and after stories topped the story off perfectly, even though it left me feeling a little empty and lonely, those stories really enhance the main series and these stories wouldn’t be as good if the original story wasn’t so amazing. The author could really be criticized for the ending, but for me it made me feel so happy, even though I didn’t feel as fulfilled as I wanted to be. I just have to say, this light novel and even the art for the manhwa is just breathtaking. Absolutely breathtaking.",
    "I entered a casual relationship with a married couple. It was perfect I always wanted to hook up with a milf and the husband never minded I never bottomed or gave head. Eventually, they'd asked me to officially join their relationship. I was against it as they were old enough to be my parents, I'd have no security in the relationship, and the idea of committing to more than one person skeeves me out. I told them it was best to keep things casual. I'd later meet my girlfriend so I broke up with them. Things almost immediately went to shit. They both started harassing me. I got to the point where I had to inform my GF which meant I had to come out to her. I never intended on doing so since I would effectively be straight in our relationship. I was also scared she would see me as less attractive. Thankfully she didn't care and was supportive through the ordeal. I managed to finally get the couple the stop harassing me by threatening to post some videos we made online. Things will work in the end but I hate that I was essentially forced to out myself before I was comfortable",

If I hurt someone it has to be for a reason, and it just hurts me because the way she looks at me, it just doesn't feel right, that she looks at me as a violent person, especially when you sprinkle on the fact that I am a Male and we're muslims, so you can imagine what she thinks a man will do just because he's a man, and after all that, either no one takes me seriously or they never side with me or help me at least, just makes me feel worthless",
    "So I was terminated shortly after lockdowns last year after only ever recieving one write up a month and a half before. And this was in a year and a half long term with an employer. But business declined sharply and then after a couple of weeks with everyone getting their hours cut, I was terminated citing that I had violated the rulebook by smoking. In the block for unemployment that the employee provided the department of labor, there are 3 falsified write ups that I never saw or signed. One even has white out on it where they redacted something. I had been injured. In a neglect incident a few months before and was due two pay raises that had been promised. So my impression is that I was gotten rid of to cut labor expenses. But it was during a pandemic recession and I basically was reduced to homelessness. So I appealed.

Have a kid at home while having to be in the hospital for an extended stay? Have baby at 34 weeks/ a NICU stay? I am lost and could just use some advice/ experience/ or anything else.",
    "I'm interested in reading some of the worst you may've come across, whatever culture you're from and whichever nationality the pundit was. Like, there are the obvious ones like I once heard a Japanese commentator say \"David Pocockuuuu\" but I mean they're quite far away and all, but one of the worst I've heard might be a French commentator on Bein Sports pronouncing it \"Courtney LOVES\". No issue whatsoever with having an accent, no problem at all there, but when you're effectively transforming a name by reading it just the way your brain would spontaneously process it as a foreigner without getting a few basics in or checking with anyone beforehand, I find that amazing how lazy and unprofessional that is. For the entire match: \"Courtney Loves\".",
    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize. Great action scenes, big issue that touches past Bond and M which little is known. Sam Mendes does a masterful job directing this installment of James Bond. Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",
    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life. The animation looks great, the humor is on point of course, and the characters with so much more development. With some great moments is a fun sequel to all ages!",
    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for \"Airplane\", \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", and the \"Naked Gun\" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the \"Hotel Gay Schluffen\", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If \"Top Secret!\" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means \"She whose bosoms defy gravity\"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, \"Top Secret!\" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie.

It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither.

    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea.",
    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :<br/><br/><ul><li>Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole \"let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead\" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be \"safe\"? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!</li></ul><br/><br/>The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!<br/><br/>While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!<br/><br/>Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).<br/><br/>The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* \"twist\" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.<br/><br/>Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.<br/><br/>A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",
    "While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",
    "June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as \"Warriors of the Wind\" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible \"Princess Mononoke\" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer \"Nausicaa\". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort.",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (\"the Bear\") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of \"Glory Road\" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the \"Pit\". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about \"the Bear\" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as \"the Bear\". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book \"Glory Road\" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by \"the Bear\", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book \"Slam Dunk to Glory\". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.<br/><br/>I'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.<br/><br/>VALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",
    "That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful.

    "Terminator Salvation gets panned left and right.....but let me first say this is way more better then T3 and Genisys by miles.<br/><br/>Not only is it a serious terminator movie.....its more faithful to the first 2, yes it has plot holes and not die hard terminator violence but what do you expect when companies are trying to make everything PG13 for money.<br/><br/>This is the Terminator movie you get, to throwbacks to Guns n Rose you could be mine to a CGI arnie wreaking havoc, yes it could of been done better but some of it is actually really good, just accept and stop expecting the greatness of T2, that was cameron and this is MCG two different directors.<br/><br/>The acting is good, don't know what everyone is going on about with Bale being a weak connor when he is perfect for the role, yelchin plays a fantastic kyle reese and sam worthington is great as marcus.<br/><br/>Relax, watch and enjoy a good summer action movie with no expectations, the opening helicopter scene is a work of art.<br/><br/>TS - 7/10",
    "Once Jake Gyllenhaal signed on to do Nightcrawler I knew it would be a special film. The man has been producing nothing but gold lately and this is no different. Nightcrawler is an experience - it takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of seemingly charming slimeball reporter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). <br/><br/>Nightcrawler works on so many levels. The writing and direction is fantastic, which is especially impressive as it's the directorial debut by Dan Gilroy who takes on both duties. He had a clear vision of how he wanted to portray LA and the sleek, brooding yet slightly lackadaisical tone transfers perfectly onto the big screen. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance that's the polar opposite from his character in Prisoners and he was on point for every second. He was the perfect casting choice to carry the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a clear message on the media and how they abuse stories and reap the benefits regardless of who gets victimized. It's a message that has been told a million times before, but never quite like this. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou, who starts freelancing as a videographer of crime scenes and selling his footage to a news channel for money. We go along this journey with Lou and watch his transformation from being a sleazy but ambitious individual to becoming a manipulative, self-serving sociopath. Then you start to realize that he was like that all along. His charming charisma masked his true intentions, and this peek into his psyche is the most potent and disturbing aspect of the movie. It's a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle, and told with enough elegance and wit to keep you on board the whole way.<br/><br/>There's a dark comedic tone present throughout. Lou's persistence and crass remarks to basically anyone he encounters provide some good laughs. He doesn't sugarcoat anything, he'll talk to anyone in order to get his way, and he has a sleazy smirk that never fails to get a reaction. Also Gyllenhaal's chemistry with Rene Russo (the news director) is palatable and their work dynamic becomes more of a gripping co-dependency as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Nightcrawler is a must-watch for fans of cinema. It's a work of art from a directorial and writing standpoint, from an acting standpoint, and from a basic human nature standpoint. It really does a hell of a job at sucking you into this dark gloomy world to the point where you don't want to get out. It's intense, it's funny, it's thrilling, it's powerful, and most of all, it's real. Nightcrawler is simply sensational.",
    "Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'. <br/><br/>The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events. <br/><br/>In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.<br/><br/>One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.<br/><br/>Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games). <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work. <br/><br/>These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.<br/><br/>Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.<br/><br/>What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children. <br/><br/>Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain.",
    "It was made to be silly. There's nothing in this movie that's meant to offend anyone. It's a silly, fun-loving, harmless movie. I enjoyed it when I was 8 and I still do now at 18. Anyone who takes this movie seriously, needs to relax, have fun, enjoy the goofiness. This movie is one you can enjoy with your friends, family and young children DON'T have to be sent out of the room for inappropriate action.<br/><br/>It's silly, remember that. It's supposed to make you laugh!<br/><br/>All the girls are young, and the band still together. A few years later, everything fell apart for them. Enjoy the youth and laughter while you can.",
    "Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br/><br/>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br/><br/>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br/><br/>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br/><br/>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br/><br/>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br/><br/>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are great again<br/><br/>Charm returns<br/><br/>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Only one movie with Baby Groot? Noooo!<br/><br/>They seem to have dropped Drax's taking everything literal jokes away<br/><br/>Michael Rosenbaum was wasted<br/><br/>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br/><br/>Batista should have skipped over wrestling and just been an actor",
    "Having watched the film (more than once)i must say that i think that the person who wrote the comment \"A Stupid and Extremely Disappointing Movie\" is being silghtly childish. You cannot watch a film like Van Helsing with out taking it with a pinch of salt - it is a movie with vampires, werewolves and the frankenstine monster in at all at once for goodness sake. So you cannot go in to it thinking in a literal sense. You have to accept that it is not going to be some ground breaking epic and that it is just a bit of fun - but at the end of the day that doesn't matter, because if you go in with the right attitude and you enjoy it, then what does it matter that it is a bit \"off\" in places. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to any one who likes action/fantasy films and is up for a bit of fun!",
    "Ever wondered what it would be like to see Tom Cruise taking a break from his usual Sci-Fi & Impossible series \"avatar\". Well, here is your answer - It gets even more exciting and entertaining. This is Tom Cruise's real life take on the impossible series where Barry Seal replaces Ethan Hunt and CIA as the agency, which dictates the terms. It's just that Barry loves to go with the flow and without any intention of getting involved with anything that seems out of his league and this is something each one of us can relate to. He is your usual guy who happens to be a pilot and wants to make some extra cash with every extra mile. So what's wrong with it? Well nothing is wrong when you do it for the right guys, and nothing gets more exciting and dangerous when those right guys turn out to be CIA.<br/><br/>What is even more amusing and entertaining to watch is the fact that despite having no choice left but to cooperate with CIA, \"Barry Seal never says no\" to any offer (even if it comes from any drug lord) that helps him maintain his cash flow that obviously was becoming unmanageable for him by every passing day. Although, I must admit that it was quite a fun to watch him trying to manage millions of cash that he had no idea how to spend. <br/><br/>You will definitely enjoy watching Tom cruise as Barry Seal who uses CIA to get his end of the bargain (and they thought that they were the only smart guys who live in one of the greatest countries of the world).<br/><br/>If you want to go on an adventure trip, go watch this movie and you will understand what Tom Cruise really means when he says, \"I am just a gringo who always delivers\".",
    "Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982's Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.<br/><br/>The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. <br/><br/>The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.<br/><br/>The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.<br/><br/>\nThe Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph.",
    "The greatest fault of The Thin Red Line was its timing - it was released at around the same time as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.  While most people dismissed The Thin Red Line as the `other' World War II movie of 1998, it's actually a very different kind of film - the film itself is not hurt by similarity to Ryan but was hurt commercially due to the misconception. It's easy to forget that Red was nominated for seven Oscars.  This is an extraordinary film that can stand well on its own next to Ryan.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan was significant in that it visually depicted war in a realistic, gritty way.  The Thin Red Line's focus is more philosophical. It is about the contradiction between the beauty of nature and the destructive nature of men.  The movie cuts continuously between the external struggle of American GIs fighting to take a crucial hill from Japanese occupation on Guadalcanal - and more importantly, the internal chaos of war as every man tries to come to his own terms about matters such as morals, death, God, and love.<br/><br/>Unlike in Saving Private Ryan, there is nothing patriotic about this movie. In fact, there probably has never been a more anti-war film.  The fighting men here are disillusioned, lost, and frightened.  They don't fight for their country or \"democracy\" - they fight because they have to.  The only priorities are survival, and - for the more humane - caring for their comrades.  Renowned composer Hans Zimmer - who won an Oscar nomination for his work-captures the grim mood perfectly and allows us to hear the men's thoughts.<br/><br/>The characters are portrayed by a strong ensemble cast.  Acting is uniformly excellent, especially Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall, who is the unfeeling commander of the ground offensive on Guadalcanal. Thoroughly unlikable, he is the closest thing to a villain in the movie.  After studying war for an untold number of years, Tall sees Guadalcanal as his chance to prove himself and move up in the ranks - the men are only a tool to accomplish this goal and expendable.  In one crucial scene, he orders a captain (played by Elias Koteas, in another outstanding role) to lead his men to a frontal assault against a Japanese controlled hill.  When the captain suggests a more logical alternative, the colonel screams: \"You are not gonna take your men around in the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!\"  To this, the captain replies, `I've lived with these men, sir, for two and a half years and I will not order them all to their deaths.'  Later, when the hill is taken, he is dismissed of his duties as Tall sees him as a threat to the successful achievement of his goal.  Certainly, not every commander must have been that coldhearted and selfish, but surely some were, though not necessarily to that extreme.<br/><br/>While the acting is very good, much of the cast is relatively unknown and it can initially be hard to distinguish the characters from each other as they may appear to be very similar.  They are all about the same age, have dirt smeared over their faces, and wear helmets and the same military garb. Also, the stars in this movie have very small roles.  George Clooney and John Travolta are credited with starring roles while really little more than extras - clearly for marketing purposes.  You will not see more than two minutes of each.<br/><br/>One of the main themes of the movie is the contrast between nature and men's destructiveness in war.  The director, Terrence Malick, hired cinematographer John Toll to capture this on camera, and towards achieving that goal they couldn't have been more successful.  The almost surreal scenery is nothing short of stunning and has the same visual impact as any special effect.  The beauty of nature is always present, even when it is a setting for battle of destruction, and death.<br/><br/>Though the battle scenes fall short of the frightening realism in Saving Private Ryan, they are heads and soldiers above every previous attempt. One truly gets the sense that war is a chaotic, often hopeless environment where it is only a matter of luck whether you survive or get killed.<br/><br/>\n`How did we lose the good that was given us? Or let it slip away? Scatter it carelessly ... trade it for what has no worth?'  The film is filled with such poetic questions as to which there are no real answers.  This is definitely not a party movie.  There isn't anything uplifting about it - it is downright depressing.  Asides from entertainment value, however, this is a film that makes you think.",
    "Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised \" Esther's secret\" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the \"secret\" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a \"creepy\" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",
    "A Gen Z update to Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 cult classic, this remake is essentially an episode of Fast and Furious in which the vehicular exploits have been replaced with an assortment of extreme sports sequences. Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like \"the only law is gravity\" and \"everyone dies, it's just a matter of how\", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences, yet they're not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller.",
    "I went into this movie confident that it would be a cheesy, campy romp with the same \"tried and true tricks of the trade,\" like when the hero is investigating the creepy music coming from the basement and a cat jumps into frame, but I quickly discovered that this would not be case with Insidious. After watching the move and obsessing on it for about 12 hours now, I can honestly say it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. In fact, there were several points during the film where I screamed like a 13-year old girl at a Justin Beiber concert. Keep in mind I was consciously trying my hardest to keep my composure, mainly because I was sitting beside my new girlfriend of 2 months. She, incidentally, didn't make a peep; thankfully, I later found out she had her eyes closed the whole time. <br/><br/>I was also expecting to see some blood and guts, especially coming from the guys who made Saw, but there wasn't a drop. Instead, they used just about everything else in their arsenal to scare the bejesus out of me and everyone else in the theater (my girlfriend included). From literally the opening credits, they created an intense, haunting tension that didn't leave my body till several whiskeys and half a Xanax later. And the movie constantly feeds that tension, making even the characters' mundane family life somehow seem utterly terrifying. I was actually exhausted leaving the theater from all of the uncomfortable squirming I was unable to control. I'd say it's the most calories I've ever burned while watching a movie (well, at least a PG-13 movie). <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was great. It was crazy scary, thoroughly entertaining, and even surprisingly funny at times. Having said that, it will be quite some time before I watch another horror movie; I have no desire to be turned into a frazzled bundle of nerves again anytime soon. So, if you plan on seeing this movie, please consider this a cautionary reminder: it's probably best to go with someone who's already witnessed you have a complete physical and mental breakdown, so as to avoid an embarrassing drive home. And maybe bring a Xanax as well.",
    "People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. <br/><br/>What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.<br/><br/>Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. <br/><br/>Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.<br/><br/>Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.<br/><br/>You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",
    "It is a classic offbeat horror-melodrama merging harmoniously the family Gothic extravaganza, supernatural power, and a woman's movie of a peculiar kind It remains the cinema's best adaptation of a Stephen King novel <br/><br/>The film initiated De Palma's inclination for surprise diverts between playful imagination and reality, as in the opening, which swifts from a soft-core porn fantasia of girls taking a shower in the locker room to the fact of Carrie's menstruation for the first timethe first sign of \"otherness\" that will reserve her as an horrifying monster from her small-minded colleagues <br/><br/>All the oppression that Carrie undergoes both at home (with a bible beating maniacal mother played by scary Piper Laurie who develops twisted bizarre ideas) and at school to suppress tension which takes the shape of super telekinetic power, the ability to move objects with the strength of her mind We observe with ambivalence as Carrie's insatiable revenge jumps the line into uncontrolled mass murders ever filmed <br/><br/>Sissy Spacek is amazing as the mocked, helpless girl pushed over the edge Her face and body twist like a living special effect to unleash her pent up rage, as well as her character's alarming progress from painfully shy high-school teenager to Angel of Vengeance",
    "This movie is soooo gross! The eye scene? Puke rising up to my mouth just thinking about it! Blech!!! So much excessive horror nastiness! Sick as heck, but just hard not to watch! Throw in the gorgeous women, and you've got a disgustingly beautiful horror flick!<br/><br/>I loved the Oli character - the king of swing - \"Of course my horse\"! And the gang of young boys that want gum! So weird! I also liked the whole Europeaness of the film - the location, language, and overall feel of it! Lent a big piece of realism to it all.<br/><br/>My negative rant is that I wanted to know more about the town, and the people, and the \"why\" of it all. I know money is part/most of it. But I wanted to know why.",
    "Sacha Baron Cohen comes to America in the guise of Borat Sagdiyev and wreaks his own brand of Kazakhi havoc in this very very funny film.<br/><br/>In our age of uber-political correctness, \"Borat\" comes sweeping through like a brisk and refreshing wind, completely bounding over every cultural taboo we've erected around ourselves. Thus, no one is safe: Borat takes on Jews, blacks, gays, feminists, middle-Americans, religious fanatics, frat boys. The only weapon against the bumbling Borat is a sense of humour, which this movie shows most Americans painfully lack. Indeed, if there is any message to be had from \"Borat\" (and I'm not sure there is much of one, beyond its fascinating cultural experiments), it's that everyone needs to lighten up and not take themselves so seriously.<br/><br/>The image of Americans projected in this film varies from the heartwarming to the downright frightening. New Yorkers threaten Borat with physical violence when he approaches them on a subway. Feminists walk out on him when they find his views on women too much to tolerate. Folks out in the heartland commiserate with him over his hatred of gays and Jews; a gun shop owner even helps him pick out the best weapon for shooting Jewish people. A sweet Jewish couple give him a place to sleep, and bring him a homey meal (that is, before they turn into invading cockroaches). A group of manic Pentecosts help him find Jesus. An RV full of frat boys make complete asses of themselves by espousing their hopelessly ill-informed views on minorities in our country and the need to revert to slavery. The majority of people treat Borat in the condescending way of those who want to think of themselves as being culturally aware without really knowing anything at all about other cultures. These people become rude the second Borat offends their sense of propriety. On the other hand, the disenfranchised of America greet Borat with open arms, and we see a group of gays and a group of blacks interacting with him as if no cultural boundaries existed at all. The film's sweetest (and most unexpectedly so) moments come from Borat's befriending of a black prostitute.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a carefully crafted work of fiction, and Cohen only lets his audience see what he wants them to see. I would probably react much the same as many of the people in this film if this crazy-looking and sounding man appeared out of nowhere and began to antagonize me. But the movie does make Americans look like a bunch of awfully self-important, uptight stiffs, and I've been to enough places in this country and met enough people to realize that the way events play out in this film (even if they are manipulated or staged) probably come very close to the real thing.<br/><br/>Thank God for movies like \"Borat.\" If nothing else, they remind us that our cultural boundaries only matter as much as we let them, and that all of the fears that govern political correctness are mostly ungrounded. After all, virtually every person in this film was offended at one point or another, and as far as I can tell, all of them lived to tell about it.<br/><br/>Grade: A",
    "In bringing together elements from Inglourious Basterds, Ocean's Eleven and Museum Hours, George Clooney certainly had plenty of opportunity for a rich and interesting story. War heroes who appreciate fine art played by the likes of Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman (plus a few \"that guy\"s), attempting to steal back priceless works of art from the Nazis, it sounds amazing.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? Well, to begin with, for a movie about a team, we're given very little time with them as a group. Almost immediately they pair off on their own little adventures. Instead of using these exploits to let us know a little more about the characters as individuals, we get the usual oddball pairings and some mildly amusing, but ultimately hollow, vignettes. Even when we lose some of our team, it really feels like nothing more than just something that happened on the trip, like \"oh, and I also saw a horse.\" We have hardly any sense of them as a group and far less about them as people. The only character whose motivations we can understand is the one played by Cate Blanchett, but her limited chemistry with Matt Damon dooms what little redemptive quality her character had.<br/><br/>Also, and particularly troubling for a movie involving art, George Clooney's lens has little reverence for the work it shows. Though the film heavy-handedly ponders whether a piece of art is worth a human life, the camera never does. Even when a character lays down his life for a sculpture, it comes off less dramatic than inevitable. The film treats the works as being mostly historically significant and never finds that lover's gaze that tells the audience why.<br/><br/>What we're left with is a bag of spare parts. It's a popcorn movie with no setpieces. A war movie with no battles. A heist movie with no scheming. An art movie with no inspiration. Were they to have found some of Inglourious Basterds' bluster, Ocean's Eleven smarts or Museum Hour's insight, they may have found a formula that works, but that's not the movie we have here. I'll be damned if George Clooney doesn't look good in a moustache, though.",
    "There's a lot of anxiety that goes into viewing The Exorcist, \"the scariest movie ever made\", for the very first time. And with that anxiety comes a lot of expectations and preconceived ideas about what The Exorcist *should* be. Especially for someone born after the film. Then on top of that waited years before finally seeing it.<br/><br/>I love the Exorcist, and after exposure to God knows how many horror films, the Exorcist remains my favorite within the genre. And even from a die-hard fan I have to admit, I hate hearing \"scariest movie of all time\" associated with this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, there's no reason to compare fright factor of films, so forget that anyone ever called The Exorcist \"the scariest movie ever made.\" Take any movie  I don't care what movie  and stick a \"greatest/scariest/best\" whatever tag next to it, and you'll have audiences investing in what they *think* it should be instead of letting the film present itself for what it is. And all they see is that it is not what they expected (expectations, I might add, that are shaped by the current gimmicks and trends in Hollywood).<br/><br/>I love the Exorcist because it dared to defy my expectations. This is not a wall-to-wall, credits-to-credits montage of scary imagery inspired by a mere scenario that's supposed to pass as a plot. This isn't a movie about that long dark corridor and something waiting to jump out of the darkness and attack (which is always preceded by a false scare featuring a cat). It's not about that cheap gimmicky scenario of X amount of people isolated from the rest of the world, with a killer/monster/ghost/whatever on the loose.<br/><br/>The Exorcist is a very slow movie that actually features a full blown plot, its characters, and their associated arcs. The original ambition of The Exorcist was to scare the world with imagery and concepts never before seen in cinema. Shocking moments that the audience of 1973 could not believe they would ever see on the silver screen (from a major studio, no less.) After 30 years, the movie isn't so shocking because times have changed, and the success of the Exorcist has guaranteed countless imitation in all forms across all boards. However, the Exorcist is still one of the most ambition horror films ever made, because (are you ready for this?)  the Exorcist dares to tell a story.<br/><br/>Everyone remembers the pea soup, the head spinning, the vulgarities spewed from the demon's mouth, the stairs, the infamous cut (now restored) spider walk. But I adore this movie for the things no one seems to bring up  I love the setup in Iraq where Father Lancaster Merrin detects the signs of his final showdown, and how these abstract scenes on subsequent viewings give the movie a more epic feel. I love the transition from Chris MacNeil to Father Karras walking across campus that's reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. I became absorbed watching Father Karras caring for his aging mother and the close relationship they have, seeing him depressed and sharing a drink with a fellow priest as he discusses his own issues with faith.<br/><br/>And what impresses me most about a movie named the Exorcist is how it seems to reject the possibility of possession and exorcism as its ultimate and final solution. The characters in the movie don't want it to be true, and in fact don't really even know about the possibility of Exorcism, thus they explore and exhaust all other possibilities (both medical and psychological). I smiled with delight (after all the hospital scenes) in that priceless moment when Chris MacNeil asks Karras, \"And how does one go about getting an exorcism?\" which stops father Karras in his tracks as he, a man of the church, looks at her as though she's lost her mind.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie resists the temptation to jump right into the acknowledgment that Regan is possessed continues to build up the epic Good versus Evil, God versus Satan, the exorcist versus the demon, feel. Like the characters, the movie doesn't want it to be true, it doesn't want to go there and embrace that possibility, but we the audience know what must inevitably happen. And it's almost magical how the movie finally acknowledges Regan's only hope. There's no glorious fanfare nor is there boastful ultimatums, instead the movie lamentingly and silently surrenders to it as we watch Lancaster Merrin walking up the sunny garden path, staring down at a newly delivered envelope. He doesn't have to read it. He already knows what it says, as do we.<br/><br/>The imagery then fades to an ominous foggy night as a taxi pulls up to the MacNeil place in Georgetown, then we're treated to the haunting imagery that inspired the cover art. What must be done, must be done. I love how the movie implies that Merrin has faced this very demon before through its imagery, and through the dialogue as Karras explains he's identified at least three manifestations to which Merrin answers, \"No. There is only one.\" I can address more  the acting, the beautiful cinematography, brilliant makeup  but I'll stop to keep from sounding like a raving fan who over hypes every inch of everything. I'll close with these thoughts: I'm not the type of person who will watch the same movie over and over and over. Most movies I see, the specific imagery and specific ideas don't make a deep enough impression to stick with me for more than a few months. I remember the Exorcist, not because I thought it was the \"scariest movie ever made\", rather because of the wonderful craftsmanship, the fact that it dared to tell a story, and it defied my expectations.<br/><br/>When Friday the 13th, the Grudge, Skeleton Key, and Cursed are reduced to vague memories and general ideas, I will still clearly remember the Exorcist.",
    "This movie is 20 years old, but it's still the most enjoyable movie I've seen in ages. Why can't they make movies like this again?",
    "The film that bested Star Wars for the 1977 Best Picture Oscar, Annie Hall is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking that transcends its simple, romantic premise to create a stunning portrait of not only 70's pop culture, but of human nature cumulative.  Directed and co-written by Woody Allen, who has since directed other gems such as Hannah and Her Sisters and The Purple Rose of Cairo, Annie Hall also stars Allen as Alvy Singer, a neurotic, death-obsessed comedian who seems unlucky in love and life.  That is until he meets Annie, brilliantly played by Diane Keaton, who is beautiful, fashion-savvy, carefree (she likes using expressions like `la di da'), and a terrible driver.<br/><br/>Annie and Alvy's relationship is an unlikely one.  She's a Midwestern girl, straight out of white-bread Wisconsin; he's a life-long New York Jew who grew up (literally) under the Coney Island roller coaster.  He's been seeing a therapist for the past 16 years; she only `needs' one once she meets him. She's an extroverted aspiring singer; he's an introverted, world-despising imp.  Yet Allen and Keaton are so perfect in their roles, they improbably make this couple one of the most memorable ever.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Alvy's chronicles of loves lost and a retrospective on his relationship with Annie, with whom he has since parted ways.  At the end of the film, we see Alvy try his hand at stage-writing-he writes a play about his relationship with Annie, but gives it a happy ending.  Yes, Annie and Alvy don't have a fairy tale ending to their relationship, but Alvy certainly wishes they had, even though he learns to live with the acknowledgment it has failed.<br/><br/>The best part of Annie Hall is its incredible screenplay-the best ever to be written.  Not a word is wasted nor a line unquotable.  Except here, while Allen's early films had thrived on streams of one-liners, Allen doesn't go for cheap laughs-each line is simultaneously hilarious and poignant. Everything is part of a greater whole.  We laugh because it's funny, but there's a greater dynamic at work in Annie Hall.  This is a story not exclusively about a relationship between two people, but also a musing on 70's politics, drugs, East Coast/West Coast rivalry, narcissism, religion, celebrity, and several other topics with which Allen deals with extraordinary ease.<br/><br/>Yet Annie Hall would not be among my favorite films of all-time if it were just Woody Allen ranting and raving about what he likes and dislikes. There are other Allen films that serve that purpose, i.e. Deconstructing Harry, and they're not nearly as good.  What separates Annie Hall is its grace, the believable chemistry between Keaton and Allen, the unique direction (ranging from split-screens to cartoon imagery to on-screen subtitles of what the actors are thinking), but mostly because it's the rare film to find a perfect balance between sheer entertainment, humor, and poignancy.<br/><br/>\nWhen the dust had settled, Diane Keaton deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance, Allen took home Oscars for direction and writing, and the film beat out Star Wars for Best Picture, which most people consider a complete sham.  Evidently, those people didn't see Annie Hall, for if they had, they'd recognize that the acting, writing, and even the direction in Star Wars can't hold a candle to Annie Hall, one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "With poor plotting, inconsistent pacing and a rushed sense of chemistry amongst the new cast Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales exposes the swashbuckling sequel as nothing more than a cash-grab that's as hollow as the ships they occupy.",
    "In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:<br/><br/>First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: \nIs Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?<br/><br/>Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.<br/><br/>During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",
    "Mike Newell is the weirdest choice for director of a Mafia drama, but he actually makes a terrific fist of it, delivering one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are all in top form in front of the camera, too.<br/><br/>Depp plays undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone in this intriguing true story. Pistone is trying to infiltrate his way into a mob family in order to gather evidence against them. He assumes the identity of \"Donnie Brasco\" and slowly but surely earns the love and trust of an old-pro hit-man named Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino). As the months go by, Pistone's marriage begins to fall apart as he is away from his wife (Heche) pretty much all the time. The line between his real life and his undercover life blurs together and he finds himself dangerously close to being seduced by the violent Mob lifestyle.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is an extraordinary film in many ways. As already mentioned, the performances are note-perfect. But there's so much more to it than that. The late 70s period details are impeccably captured; the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic; the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly, agonisingly conveyed. It's such a powerful picture, completely involving, that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament, asking yourself what decisions you would make in the same circumstances. Very few movies genuinely inspire you to debate the whats, whys and wherefores of the main character and his actions... but with Donnie Brasco, that's just what you'll find yourself doing.",
    "One might argue Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film, since it lacks almost everything you'll find in almost all of them: shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers, even blood. The most graphic scene is a nightmare sequence that displays a rape scene so stylized it isn't actually disturbing. But one might also argue that Rosemary's Baby is a horror film in its purest form, since it doesn't depend on all those gimmicks to create its atmosphere. I prefer the latter point of view. <br/><br/>So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly, there is something strange about them - the sounds that come from their apartment, the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbors, and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive, especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant - she recommends her another (better, as she says) gynecologist's and mixes a (healthy, as she says) herbal drink for her every day. <br/><br/>The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant: Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner (Pregnant women are supposed to gain, not lose weight, a visiting friend observes), and when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbors, her gynecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying. <br/><br/>All this is told by Roman Polanski in the perfect tone; the mood for the entire film is already set during the opening credits when we hear that weird lullaby, sung by Mia Farrow. And a lot of strange things happen throughout the entire film: Guy and Rosemary are told by Hutch, a friend of theirs, about the horrific past of the house they're now living in, a young girl that lives with the Castevets commits suicide (really a suicide?), Guy, an actor, gets the role he wanted so badly after the contestant who was originally supposed to play it turns blind, and Hutch, who might have found something out that would help Rosemary, suddenly is in a coma and dies three months later; all these (and a few other) events are precisely dosed by Polanski to draw us more and more into the film, while he makes sure on the other hand that the film doesn't become absurd. And he manages to give the film an ending that works, makes sense and is observant, slightly (but only slightly) funny and very disturbing, all at once. <br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby also contains two of the most memorable performances ever: Mia Farrow is haunting as Rosemary Woodhouse. She looks like she is physically suffering from her pregnancy and close to complete despair. And Ruth Gordon is amazing as the curious Minnie Castevet, always friendly, but also giving you the feeling that, hidden behind her generosity, she actually follows her own, obscure motives. If you have a helpful elderly female neighbor, you'll see her with other eyes once you've encountered Minnie Castevet. So, if you think a real horror film needs shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers or at least blood - watch Rosemary's Baby and you'll change your mind.",
    "Cube is a movie that explores human nature and our instinctive urges for survival vs our humanitarianism. Not a new concept, I know, however this movie does it in style, with a plot so simple that it could only be the work of a conceptual genius. I don't intend to give too much away, as the power of the film lies in it's mystery, but I will say that this movie could almost be classified as disturbing, not due to its content, but rather the thoughts that it instills in the audience. I found myself rather shaken as I left the cinema, feeling as though I had been exposed to an ugly, hidden side of humanity and society. Don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely worth seeing, I would even be so bold as to say that it must be seen! I must admit that there are few movies I have seen that have had such a profound affect on me, and I don't think I am alone in my feelings.",
    "This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun.",
    "I watch a lot of movies & I can't remember the last time a film held me so spellbound. Not only are the characters engaging & vividly portrayed by an excellent cast, the subtle dynamics of their interactions are portrayed with inspired undertone & nuance. Star billing or even an Oscar should also have been awarded to the spectacularly beautiful scenery of Montana for the vast majesty it bestowed.<br/><br/>This complex saga of love, grief & loyalty is narrated with stark simplicity by old Stab, long-time friend to retired Colonel Ludlow & his 3 sons: staid Alfred, the eldest (\"old even for his years\"); idealistic Samuel, the youngest (\"There was nothing these brothers would not do for him.\"); & wild Tristan (\"Such people become crazy or they become legends.\"). The conflict between Ludlow's fiercely anti-government anti-war stance & his sons' determination to do what they see as their duty is but a small part of the story; the heart of the tale is the rift that threatens the mutual devotion of these 3 loyal brothers as they all come to love the same woman. \"She was not to blame,\" Stab tells us, \"She was like the ice that freezes in the rock and splits it apart.\"<br/><br/>A tragic tale, yes; heartbreaking at times, but never boring. Every time I felt certain I knew what was coming next, the plot took another unexpected turn & I sat there riveted, softly breathing \"Wow!\" now & again into the darkness. This film immediately became one of my all-time favorites; I've watched it half a dozen times since then & its scope & power never fail to move me.",
    "At only 29 years of age and in only his second major studio release, Stanley Kubrick showed the world that he was a force to be reckoned with. By the time he died 42 years later his films were epochal events waited for breathlessly by his large band of devotees who considered him a director without equal. He seldom disappointed them.<br/><br/>This movie is set in World War I amidst the incredibly destructive and futile trench warfare between France and Germany. Kirk Douglas plays Frenchman Colonel Dax, who is ordered to make an impossible assault on a heavily-fortified enemy position. The only reason this charge is being made is that his commanding general, played by George Macready, believes that capturing the position will earn him a promotion. When the assault does not go forward under heavy enemy bombardment, the general is infuriated and demands that three men be arbitrarily chosen to stand trial for cowardice, an offense punishable by death. Col. Dax defends these men at their court-martial.<br/><br/>The battle and trial scenes are about as good as have ever been filmed and the high level of tension is sustained throughout the movie. After the film's climax has occurred, Col. Dax goes looking for his troops and finds them relaxing at a cafe. What he and the viewer witness there is possibly the most affecting scene I've ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>Looking at this film in perspective, it's easy to see Kubrick's trademarks even at this early stage of his career. The attention to the composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. I find myself most impressed today with the way he could handle a dramatic story like this one without any innovative techniques or unusual special effects to hide behind, then turn around and make such totally different films like '2001...' and 'Dr. Strangelove...' Other films like 'The Shining' and 'Barry Lyndon' combined a strong story line with breakthrough film techniques. His versatility astonishes me.<br/><br/>Adolphe Menjou also stars as the general who convinces Dax's superior officer to risk the ill-fated charge. Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey and Joe Turkel give strong performances as the men on trial. Turkel turns up 23 years later in another Kubrick film, 'The Shining,' playing the bartender.<br/><br/>You can take your pick: 'Paths of Glory' can rightly be described as one of the greatest war movies of all, or one of the great anti-war films, or as one of Kubrick's best. Or simply one of the best, period.",
    "Reading the back cover of the DVD and seeing that Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley are given top billing, I expected an intelligent King Arthur story. Well, it really wasn't either, although I did find it entertaining. I must not have read the description carefully enough. No matter; overall, it was fun but just a little too silly. I'm beginning to wonder about the discernment of some of these actors, how they can play such intelligent roles for a film or two and then revert to something like this.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story is really a Roman empire one, not a King Arthur story. We only see the tie-in to the later in the last few minutes of the film, in the epilogue. This action story is all about the last Caesar, a small boy, and the last legion that fought as Rome had now been taken over by the Goths. The Roman Empire had come to an end.<br/><br/>Mixed in with that tale was the famous \"excalibur\" sword. We see the origins of that and how it eventually got into the hands of King Arthur. But, once again, that is only explained in the final minutes. However, the sword is used by the good Roman general who protects the last Caesar from the Goths, who want him imprisoned for life, or killed.<br/><br/>What made the story interesting, at least for me, was the chase-scene type atmosphere of a small band of heroes protecting a little boy, fleeing the bloodthirsty Goths until they could mount some sort of counter-attack in the north in Brittania. That, and the pretty computer-generated scenery and action stunts, kept it interesting. However, don't look for credibility in those action scenes and expect the typical political-correctness of today (i.e. where a woman beats up hundreds of men and the good guys of all colors prevail despite ridiculous odds).<br/><br/>Some parts of this will leave you shaking your head in disbelief. You will feel you're watching a kids' film at times. However, if you want an hour-and-a-half of decent escapist fare, and can put your brain on hold for that time, it fits the bill and will at least entertain you.",
    "A stand-alone monument in cinema history, Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions, but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I've never seen a person say, \"2001: A Space Odyssey? I don't think I've seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?\", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you \"get it\" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is \"...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness.\" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that's sheer genius at its highest form.<br/><br/>At its premiere, 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200, including Rock Hudson who asked, \"Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?\" The New York Times remarked, \"Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring.\" \"Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,\" Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 \"trash masquerading as art\". It's understandable, though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk, audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise, 2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.<br/><br/>Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism, Kubrick saw ahead, highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity, respect, and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance, grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man, with his limited senses, cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light), Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty, emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public, for \"if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning\", as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester), it may cause \"cultural shock and social disorientation\". It's a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.<br/><br/>Yet apes are not much better. They're not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes, and with the discovery of bones as weapons, kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors, at heart, mankind has been and will always be selfish.<br/><br/>Far before The Terminator (1984) or The Matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence, there was 2001. H.A.L 9000, voice played by Douglas Rain, was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There's something about his calm voice, unpredictability, and especially, his omniscient single red eye that's so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. Neither Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) or Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film, while H.A.L, albeit a machine, exhibits some while pleading for life singing \"Daisy\" (which, by the way, is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity's fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank, Dave, and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L, contrast to what he may think, is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit, he wouldn't have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race, but if we are not careful, they soon will.<br/><br/>This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence, resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous \"Star Gate\" sequence, Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era, exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground, establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous, magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod, he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating, suggesting that man, no matter how advanced, will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later, he reaches out to the monolith, alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened, he inevitably dies.<br/><br/>A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a \"Space Baby\", an infinitely more advanced race, marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius, Kubrick ends hopeful, giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending, and it's a question for you to answer.<br/><br/>There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001's composition throughout the film, possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony, practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky's work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty, Kubrick's artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot, averaging 13.6 seconds, possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.<br/><br/>But of course, it's impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it's hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects, clever rotating sets, fastidiously constructed spaceships, the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence, or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting, but what's the point? You don't need me to appreciate 2001's immaculate visuals.<br/><br/>Finally, the choice of music is outstanding. Originally, Alex North was appointed to score the film, but Kubrick turned it down in post-production. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly, \"North's (rejected) score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.\"<br/><br/>\"But why all the slow parts?\" asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily, to establish tone. Unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it, 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not, challenges humanity's fate, and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot's average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between, the whole film would've been a mess. Space isn't fast-paced like we see in most movies. Space is slow-really, really, slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius, a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.<br/><br/>Thankfully, its ingenuity was gradually recognized, and it's now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive #6 on the BFI \"Sight and Sound\" Critics' poll in 2012, ties for 2nd in the Director's poll, places 15th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of \"greatest science-fiction films of all time\".<br/><br/>2001: A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags, the dialogue is unnatural, the static camera creates no visual interest, there are barely any emotional punches, characters are monotonous, and none of the protagonists, if there even are, have dimensionality, arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless, it's transcendental and sublime, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, visually revolutionary, technically impeccable, monumentally imaginative, substantially rich, and way ahead of its time, thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.<br/><br/>Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them. Happy 50th birthday.",
    "Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen `losers to winners' sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).<br/><br/>All this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things. You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.<br/><br/>Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.<br/><br/>The comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.<br/><br/>There isn't much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn't fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational `Hoosiers' imitation was misplaced.<br/><br/>This film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel `The Leg' Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.<br/><br/>This film won't be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.  I rated it an 8/10.  Subtract two points if you aren't amused by slapstick and boorish behavior, and another two if you aren't a football fan.  For the rest of you, be prepared to split a gut.",
    "The Favourite, the seventh feature from Greek auteur <a href=\"/name/nm0487166/\">Yorgos Lanthimos</a>, is a film that eschews both convention and expectation. On the other hand, it's also Lanthimos's most accessible by a country mile. A savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power - it's all of these and yet none of them. A film I liked but didn't love, on the one hand, it's too long, the plot too threadbare, and the metaphors and allegories too ill defined. On the other, the acting is flawless, it looks amazing, the first half is very, very funny, and the end is very, very dark, with the last shot one of the most haunting/disturbing images I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Set in England in 1708, the film tells the story of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (an icy <a href=\"/name/nm0001838/\">Rachel Weisz</a>) and one-time scullery maid Abigail Hill (<a href=\"/name/nm1297015/\">Emma Stone</a>, charting a course from doe-eyed ingénue to vicious Machiavellian intrigant) and their increasingly bitter rivalry for the affections of Queen Anne (an absolutely mesmerising <a href=\"/name/nm1469236/\">Olivia Colman</a>), and is the first film Lanthimos has directed which neither he nor <a href=\"/name/nm3328207/\">Efthymis Filippou</a> wrote (the script was originally written by <a href=\"/name/nm7629302/\">Deborah Davis</a> in 1998 and later refined by <a href=\"/name/nm1110111/\">Tony McNamara</a>). Although it deals with real historical personages and events, historians probably won't be too thrilled to learn that Lanthimos is relatively uninterested in either historical actuality or socio-political contextualisation (to say nothing of the slam dancing). This is a story about a love triangle, with everything else just the background noise against which that triangle plays out.<br/><br/>And it is most definitely a Yorgos Lanthimos film, with his peculiar Weltanschauung omnipresent. The emotionless and monotone delivery of dialogue has been scaled back considerably from <a href=\"/title/tt3464902/\">The Lobster (2015)</a> and <a href=\"/title/tt5715874/\">The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017)</a>, but everything else you'd expect is here - the pseudo-omniscient judgemental glare; the dark absurdist humour; the formal rigidity; the emotional isolation of the characters; the surrealism; the games of psychological one-upmanship; the alienation of the audience; the thematic centrality of shifting power relations; the lack of distinction between poignancy and joviality; the use of self-contained and closed off pocket universes where characters must play by rules differing from those of the outside world; intimate familial conflict (except in bigger rooms than in his previous films); and a disorienting score. Similarly, whilst The Lobster was a savage dystopian-set allegory for discipline and conformity, The Favourite is a merciless satire of decadence and pettiness, taking in such additional themes as class, gender, love, lust, duty, loyalty, partisan politics, patriarchal hegemony, and women behaving just as appallingly as men.<br/><br/>As one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless, with many of the compositions having the appearance of a fête galante painting, so meticulously integrated are <a href=\"/name/nm0694309/\">Sandy Powell</a>'s costume design, <a href=\"/name/nm2356249/\">Fiona Crombie</a>'s production design, and <a href=\"/name/nm0752811/\">Robbie Ryan</a>'s cinematography. Powell's costumes are historically inaccurate, but thematically revealing, with the situation of the characters at any given moment directly influencing the design, especially in relation to Abigail as she climbs the social ladder. In a more general sense, the black-and-white colour scheme of much of the wardrobe contrasts magnificently with Crombie's predominantly brown production design, with the actors effortlessly standing out from the backgrounds.<br/><br/>Of Ryan's photography, perhaps the most impressive feat is that, despite the many scenes tracking characters through rooms, up stairs, and out doorways, there's not a single Steadicam shot anywhere in the film. He also makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which distort the spaces the characters occupy whilst also showing much more of the environment than a normal lens, creating the sense of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. Combined with the whip pans seen throughout the film, the cumulative effect is a world rendered strange, a place of distortion and unnatural compositions. As with most of Lanthimos' work, the film also uses natural light, which makes for some stunning candle-lit night-time compositions, partially recalling the paintings of someone like Jean-Antoine Watteau or, even moreso, Georges de La Tour.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, there really are no words to describe just how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she is able to elicit empathy mere moments after behaving thoroughly shamefully, communicating a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Yes, she can be a horrible person with appalling manners and questionable hygiene, but she is also deeply lonely, a survivor who has lost 17 children in childbirth, a woman whose health has made her old before her time, a tragic figure too naïve to see how badly she is being manipulated by Sarah and Abigail. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, illuminating Anne's humanity amongst her least appealing characteristics, and finding both wit and pathos in a character whose mercurial nature and excessive neediness could easily have rendered her the film's antagonist. It truly is one of the finest on-screen performances in a long time.<br/><br/>The film's most salient theme, one could argue its very raison d'être, is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, it's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the men are portrayed as petty, vainglorious idiots. Men, in general, are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped - with their ridiculous wigs and heavy makeup, they exist only to support the women. However, what's especially interesting about the film's depiction of gender is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. Sure, the women are much smarter than the men who surround them, but they are no less greedy or cruel. At the film's post-première press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos explained, \"what we tried to do is portray women as human beings. Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends...Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings.\" Similarly, when asked by the Hollywood Reporter if a film about females treating each other badly might be considered a setback in a post #MeToo era, Colman explained, \"How can it set women back to prove that women fart and vomit and hate and love and do all the things men do? All human beings are the same. We're all multifaceted, many-layered, disgusting and gorgeous and powerful and weak and filthy and brilliant. That's what's nice. It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy.\"<br/><br/>As regards criticisms, although I personally wouldn't class them as flaws, some people will probably dislike the same things that many have disliked in Lanthimos's previous work - cold formal rigidity, perverse sense of humour, and irredeemable characters being irredeemably horrible to one another. There will be those who find the obviously intentional anachronisms too much, whilst others will take umbrage with the disregard for historical authenticity. For me, whilst I admire Lanthimos for trying to bring something new to his oeuvre, especially when compared to Sacred Deer (which just repeated the beats of The Lobster), I felt the film was oftentimes trying to work its way through an identity crisis, unsure of exactly what kind of tone to settle on. I had similar feelings about the allegories that run throughout, and are never what you would call fully fleshed out. Obviously, it's a treatise on power and the ridiculous opulence of royalty, but that's not exactly an untapped issue in cinema. Additionally, one of my biggest problems with Sacred Deer was how utterly pointless it felt, and although I got a lot more out of The Favourite, I had something of the same reaction to it. It could also be argued that the characters are a little two dimensional, and filmgoers who need a protagonist to latch onto, someone to root for, will be left rudderless.<br/><br/>Superior to <a href=\"/title/tt1859446/\">Alpeis (2011)</a> and Sacred Deer, but not a patch on <a href=\"/title/tt1379182/\">Kynodontas (2009)</a> or The Lobster, The Favourite will probably attract a sizable unprepared audience because of awards buzz, positive reviews, and excellent trailer. Undoubtedly, for a lot of people, this will be their first exposure to Lanthimos, and I can only imagine what people expecting a Merchant Ivory costume drama will make of it all. Neither morally enlightening nor historically respectful, The Favourite offers a bleak assessment of humanity's core drives; not Lanthimos's bleakest, but a hell of a lot more nihilistic than an average multiplex goer will be used to. The characters within the film live in a milieu of egotism, narcissism, sexual cruelty, psychological bullying, greed, and hunger for power. There's barely a hint of sentimentality, and very little that could be called morally righteous. I would have liked it to have more meat on its bones, but at the same time, one cannot deny that it presents something of a faithful looking-glass, as Lanthimos continues to corner the market in pointing out not just humanity's worst foibles, but its most egregious eccentricities and lamentable character defects.",
    "I'm usually pretty cynical about cheesy movies but this movie absolutely floored me.  Drew Barrymore was phenomenal playing role of Julia Sullivan. I've seen the movie at least 30 times by now and her expressions still make me cry, they're just so sincere. I don't know how else to put it.  As for Adam Sandler I think that this is his best role yet, he's a real person in this movie not just some overgrown immature goofball.  On top of everything it's a brilliant 80s satire, for me its right up there with American Psycho. I understand why someone would have reservations about watching this movie but my advice would be to put your cynicism aside for a couple of hours and just watch with an uncritical mind.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",
    "Train to Busan was a treat. <br/><br/>A look into Selfishness vs Selflessness and Individual vs The Collective.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a foreign film this much. The cinematography is excellent, the story is original, and I will definitely be keeping an eye on Sang-ho Yeon's future projects.",
    "Cute movie. Has a couple of great messages -- especially one about prejudices. There are some adult jokes, some childish jokes, lots of laugh out loud moments but most importantly the following messages: Hatred against those we don't know is wrong; Let yourself get to know a person before deciding whether they are good or not; and go along for the ride and let yourself enjoy life.<br/><br/>I also love the fact that this is a Dad raising his child situation. There are really few movies that show a Dad can step up and do the right thing for their children if given the chance.<br/><br/>While I didn't particularly care for the fart joke or some of the childish parts the kids in the theater laughed and laughed.<br/><br/>Well done!",
    "I think this film is wonderful. It is sheer entertainment for kids and hilarious for adults.<br/><br/>I first watched this movie age 7, and i loved it...now i watch it again age 14 and I'm howling with laughter. The 'You wanna buy a sundial?' sequence renders me unable to breathe for laughter, whilst when i was younger it got not so much as a giggle.<br/><br/>As with all Disney films, the jokes are for the 'big kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!<br/><br/>Overall - 8/10",
    "I saw this at a special screening. I have not stopped thinking about it since. A emotional and powerful film that I will remember forever. I can't fault anyone who doesn't want to see this film. But please put to rest any fears that this film was made purely to turn a profit and serves no purpose.<br/><br/>For all those who were afraid that this film would be exploitive, propaganda filled Hollywood schlock, I'm sorry to say that could not be farther from the truth.<br/><br/>Though for the most part I'm still at a loss for words I'll do my best to give you a short and sweet overview. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible by making a Hollywood film about this subject everyone is afraid to touch, but made it in such a way that it's hard to find fault, despite everyone's initial misgivings. No 'rah rah' patriotism. No veiled political stances. No cartoonish villains. No making the enemy sympathetic. Just a brilliantly executed look at what did happen and what 'might' have happened on that fateful day.<br/><br/>What makes it more effective is that all throughout you don't recognize any of the actors. They may as well be \"real people\". You're never thinking to yourself, 'oh that's Nicolas Cage', conscious of the fact that it's acting. And come to find out, many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves! This makes it all the more real and draws you in and takes you back to that day.<br/><br/>And when the passengers decide to fight back? There's no swelling of violins or slow motion shots. They don't have a rallying cry or 'lets do it for Uncle Sam' type speech to motivate everyone. No, these passengers were reacting spontaneously to the situation as it played out and were acting on their survival instinct. You can't help but think how you would react in that situation and makes it all the more compelling and powerful. <br/><br/>I won't say this film is for everyone. It IS hard to watch at times. But I'm so glad I did see it. Very cathartic in a way. And trust me, this film couldn't have been done in a more professional, classy way. This feels genuine; of course they are going to 'profit' off it, but you get the sense that the filmmakers and everyone involved poured their hearts into this project and did this to tell a story. A more dignified and heroic story I don't think I've ever seen.",
    "Many people compare \"Once Upon a Time in America\" with \"The Godfather\". In my opinion these two movies can't be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don't compare a Picasso to Michelangelo's Sixteen Chapel either, do you?<br/><br/>What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. <br/><br/>The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut. <br/><br/>The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn't said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.<br/><br/>Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn't left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.<br/><br/>I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.",
    "I have to say I didn't expect this. I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.<br/><br/>The story is about an investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton(Michael Douglas in one of his best roles) who is greedy and self centred and who lives alone in his huge mansion. His brother(Sean Penn) gives him a card telling him to contact the company and it is his birthday present to him. What follows is absolute edge of the seat stuff and it shows David fincher at a time when he made some of the finest movies ever seen in Hollywood. In the midst of all this, he meets a waitress named Christine. Revealing more might spoil the movie for you as it is a fun roller-coaster ride with many twists and turns.<br/><br/>What impressed me about this movie was the atmosphere throughout the movie. It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editing(which is the popular way of making movies today), The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.<br/><br/>I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music. The slow motion sequence at the end is also well done and this has got to be one of the best endings of all time.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.",
    "More thematically compelling and with better action set-pieces, Toy Story 2 is a sequel that is just as good as the original - and one that isn't afraid to go to the more emotional side of storytelling.",
    "The concept of Limitless is fantastic - what would happen if you could take a pill (NZT) that would allow you to use 100% of your brain (instead of the standard 20%) and function on a level higher than you have ever functioned before? The possibilities for such a movie idea are well, limitless - pun intended - but unfortunately, despite some great acting, especially by Bradley Cooper, who plays Eddie Morra - the lead whose life the movie follows throughout it's duration, the film just could not overcome some major plot holes, sloppy writing and nonsensical moments.<br/><br/>LOTS OF SPOILERS...<br/><br/>Many times throughout the film, the script uses PLOT driven storyline instead of CHARACTER driven storyline in order to go from Point A to Point B which the script called for & in the process, didn't make much sense given who the characters were in the picture. Some examples:<br/><br/>1) The movie needed for Eddie to find the NZT stash & money in his Brother in Law's apartment, steal it, get away with it and then take the pill, feel the effects, and use the money to regain his life. Problem? It's absolutely ridiculous to imply that the cops wouldn't have searched him or at the very least patted him down after calling in a murder & going down to the station for questioning. Of course, the huge wad of cash/pills he shoved down the back of his pants would have been found had they searched him so it didn't happen. It's illogical and absolutely ridiculous that he would be able to steal what he did from the apartment, an apartment that he locked himself in when the police initially arrived - and have no issues.<br/><br/>2) The movie needed for the Russian thug to come after Eddie in order to find the NZT, take it and then make trouble for him the entire movie. Problem? It's not believable that super smart Eddie wouldn't remember to pay back the 100k that he borrowed especially when the money was constantly on his mind and he had just made 2 million off of what he borrowed. This is clear cut plot driven over character driven storyline because it's ridiculous for Eddie, the character, to not remember such a basic task, especially when there was direct danger to his life if he forgot.<br/><br/>3) The movie needed for Atwood's lawyer to steal Eddie's stash of pills causing Eddie to spiral out. Problem? Isn't it far fetched to imply that Atwood's henchman killed the woman in the hotel to frame her murder on Eddie at the oft chance that Eddie would retain the same lawyer that worked for Atwood just so he could get close to him to steal his pills for Atwood to save Atwood's life? Huh? How did the henchman/lawyer even know that the pills would be on Eddie to take? They never used to be - the custom suit w/ hidden pocket was something new. He certainly didn't carry them on him back when the woman was initially killed. This whole setup was contrived and made no sense and was based on a lot of coincidences, ones that no one could have predicted.<br/><br/>That is just a few examples of sloppy storytelling. There are also a bunch of basic nit picks that I have like: 1) Why didn't Eddie, who was fearing for his life, buy a gun & train how to use it under the help of NZT? He hires bodyguards and buys a fortress to live in but doesn't purchase a handgun? 2) Why didn't the scientists who made NZT take it themselves in order to use their super smarts to perfect the drug and make it what Eddie's scientists were able to create in the end without the aid of being under the drug's influence? 3) After drinking the Russian's NZT laced blood, why did Eddie lie there on the ground waiting for the henchmen to return so he could poke one in the eye w/ a needle? Why not get out of there? Did we really need that stupid fight scene? 4)Breaking into the safe with a chainsaw in minutes? Impressive 5) Is it really believable that NZT wouldn't have hit the black market and been all over the place?<br/><br/>Lastly - a huge problem I had with Limitless was the happy, Hollywood, contrived Ending. Withdrawal from NZT? Side effects? Once the drug wears off so does the heightened brain activity? No problem - the movie flashes forward 12 months to give Eddie Morra a rainbows, puppies & sunshine like ending where his labs have now created a pill that works like NZT only there are no side effects and the super smart effects are permanent. How nice! He's all happy now & brilliant forever & running for Senate - he's with his girlfriend & their ordering food and look, he's fluent in a foreign language because he's so smart and YUCK. The ending was so over the top in an 'everything worked out in the end' way. I hated it. I didn't need for Eddie to die or crash and burn or anything like that but Limitless took the concept of a happy ending to another level.<br/><br/>Also, with the ending comes a rushed attempt to villanize De Niro's character of Carl Van Loon who out of no where makes a pathetic power play by trying to blackmail Eddie & is quickly shot down. The whole scene between them fell flat for me and felt incredibly sloppy and quickly put together.<br/><br/>Overall, in spite of all the shortcomings, Limitless is still a really good movie. It's thrilling, fast paced and the basic concept is interesting and makes for an entertaining film - you just can't really think about things like logic or else you will be disappointed. 7/10",
    "OK - if you've already seen the movie and hated it, my review won't change your mind, so move along folks, move along, there's nothing to see for you here, thanks.<br/><br/>Now for you, dear film fan, who is about to watch 'The Hateful Eight', but who is now slightly worried because of some very mixed critical reactions - for YOU I'm writing this 100% spoiler-free review.<br/><br/>Judging from many comments here on IMDb and other forums, I gather that many long-time Tarantino fans apparently don't like his newest film. I had feared such a reaction as soon as I had finished watching the movie. It's obviously Tarantino's least accessible effort yet, and there's a number of reasons for that, not the least of which being that this is simply not the film most people expected (or felt they were promised). So if you haven't seen it yet and you're a bit doubtful because of the negative reviews, let me tell you: you'll likely end up loving it - as I did - IF you prepare yourself juuuust a little. And because I really liked the movie, I would like to help you do that via a short list of recommendations. Ready? Here it goes:<br/><br/>1. Don't go watch 'The Hateful Eight' expecting a \"classic\" Western. It might belong to the Western genre, but if all that talk about Ultra 70mm Panavision had you thinking of lush outdoor scenery, vast landscapes or anything resembling a Sergio Leone movie, you'll end up disappointed. There are a few nice shots showing snowy mountains, but 95% (perhaps more) of the story unfolds indoors (in one single room) - which isn't to say that the cinematography isn't absolutely fantastic. In fact, it's more than fantastic: it's stunning and worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>2. Don't expect any exciting \"action\" scenes (for lack of a better word: I don't mean the 'Fast & Furious' kind of action scenes) every 10 minutes or so; in fact, don't expect anything other to happen between the characters than dialog for a loooooong time. Unlike in Tarantino's previous films where we got almost \"spoiled\" by unexpected over-the-top moments in nearly every scene (except maybe for 'Jackie Brown' and 'Deathprooof'), this film has a very, very slow build. But: that's not to say it ISN'T exciting (or that nothing does happen) - it's just that the excitement and tension result mainly from the dialog and the excellent performances by the cast (at least for roughly two thirds of the movie).<br/><br/>3. Best approach this film as you would theater; for that's what 'The Hateful Eight' really is: a stage play disguised as a movie. A stage play of a \"Who-Done-It\" murder mystery with a touch of Agatha Christie. But then again, that's also a disguise, for the murder mystery is just a ploy to cast a look at a torn society rife with racial tension after the civil war. Which, of course, again serves as an allegory for race relations in modern-day America and as the director's angry commentary on how hateful that situation still is today, on all sides. Now that sounds awfully serious, but don't worry; despite some hard-to-stomach ugliness and the highly political undercurrent, there is plenty of Tarantino's trademark humor throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>4. Don't expect to find a likable character you can root for. There's a reason for the film's title, and unlike in all his previous films, there is not a single person in Tarantino's latest movie you'll feel any real sympathy for. All the main characters have committed despicable, hateful acts, and they're all beyond redemption - but that doesn't mean they're not compelling to watch (especially given THIS cast: everyone is fantastic, but Jackson, Russell, Jason Leigh and Goggins are just a joy to watch).<br/><br/>5. Don't expect a complex plot. In my opinion, among Q.T's films this is the one with the most straight forward and most simple plot to date, yet at the same time it's arguably his most complex - and most ambitious - film.<br/><br/>So, dear film fan, that's it: adhere to these here 5 \"commandments\", and there's a big chance you'll end up loving Mr. Banana Chin's latest oeuvre as much as I did (mind; you might love the film just as much without taking any of the above advice). I admit, it took me a while to get into this dialog-heavy stage play and would-be Western, but once I did, I never looked back (and I can hardly wait to watch it again). 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",
    "Many people say the cried at the end of this movie... Huh! Knowing the plot already, I (a grown up man) can barely hold my tears from the very beginning whenever I watch it. Much more than just a \"cute and sad fairy tale\", this movie is a true piece of art. This is one of those rarest cases when a bunch of talented and truly, but truly dedicated people set out to create something beautiful, some chemistry occurs and ... a miracle happens. Fortunately for all of us, this miracle immortalized on film.<br/><br/>Throughout the human history, the wisdom of generation was conveyed through fairy tales. This tale is no exception. This story, told in magic simplicity, actually has some deep philosophical meanings. While mercilessly debunking the true nature of human beings, this tragic story really tears your heart, and yet it fills it with hope. That is the true and, perhaps, the only purpose of art, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Why do we need music, painting, theatre, poetry? Is there a real excuse for their existence? To me, the only purpose, the only excuse is to help people go on, to give them hope. And it's well worth it!<br/><br/>To sum up, easily Tim Burton's best, this film is a masterpiece, my favorite American movie, and probably one of the best movies of all times. 10/10",
    "I have been waiting for the right time to review this film. I did not feel until today that I was truly ready to say all I had to say about director Rob Reiner's unforgettable staple of 1980s pop culture. When I first saw The Princess Bride, I was only 7 years old, and hardly cognizant of film as anything but a pastime. While I remember the movie as being enjoyable, I did not have anywhere near as strong a liking or appreciation for it as I do now. I certainly did not remember the film as a theater-going experience, and recently, I got the chance to view it, on the big screen, with at least fifty others in attendance at a midnight screening.<br/><br/>Personally, I am one of those people who, by nature, absorbs memorable quotes, and by that token, the entirety of The Princess Bride is fair game. As I sat there watching, I could always hear somebody, if not more than one person, at least whispering along with the movie under his or her breath. Meanwhile, I noticed that there was a wide disparity of age groups. There were pre-teens, teens, people in their twenties, thirties, and some that looked well past forty. If the showing had not been at midnight, I do not doubt that there would have been pre-pre-teens as well.<br/><br/>With a screenplay written by William Goldman (based on his book), The Princess Bride is a classic, familiar story of a princess, her true love, and the forces that come between them. As is evidenced by those in attendance, this is a story for all ages. The manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by Goldman and Reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film. As any fan of the movie will tell you, however, it is the film's whimsical, irreverent, pervasive tongue-in-cheek antics that make it an unqualified masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you hang around people who love this film, do not be surprised if they react to unbelievable situations with the exclamation, \"Inconceivable!\" Likewise, if you tell them to just wait a minute, don't be thrown aback when they suddenly sport a Spanish accent in saying, \"I hate waiting.\" And if you suddenly, from out of nowhere, hear, \"Hello.my name is Inigo Montoya.you killed my father.prepare to die,\" don't worry. It's not your fault, and you're not going to die.<br/><br/>While The Princess Bride has the sort of satirical edge more geared towards adults, the film is equally effective as a pure fairytale, and for this reason, there is a little something for everyone. In addition, the film enacts a self-referential tribute to the power and beauty of fairytale stories, even in the current age in which many consider them archaic and obsolete.<br/><br/>A sick grandson (Fred Savage), who is spending his time mindlessly playing video games (of the nostalgic Atari 8-bit type), gets a visit from his grandfather (portrayed through a wonderful performance from Peter Falk). To the grandson's dismay, his elder has brought a book to read to him. When he expresses disapproval at his grandfather's old-fashioned ways, the grandfather's response is, \"When I was your age, television was called books.\" Even this quote stands out as resonant and memorable.<br/><br/>The grandson starts out expressing skepticism and boredom, but of course, as the reading of the story progresses, this gradually gives way to captivation and praise. Buttercup (Robin Wright, in her breakthrough role) is a fair-haired, stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged to the smug, cowardly Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), the prince who rules over the land of Florin. She of course does not love him, and she has been without joy since her true love, a farm boy named Wesley (Cary Elwes), was reportedly murdered on the seas.<br/><br/>Of course, without Wesley, there is no story of true love, and we know that he must miraculously return to her someday. This happens through an extraordinary, and increasingly hilarious, set of circumstances. A group of three bandits kidnap Buttercup with the intent of killing her to precipitate a war between Florin and its enemy, Guilder. These three are (in order of increasing stature) the intellectually pompous Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), the Spanish swordsman Inigo (Mandy Patinkin), and the big-hearted slow-witted giant Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant, in one of the most no-brainer casting decisions in all of film history).<br/><br/>During the kidnapping, however, a mysterious man in black closes in on the trail of the three abductors, and it is this man who takes on each of the three one by one in battles of skill, strength, smarts, and of course, deliciously witty repartee. There is something unusually extraordinary about these battles, however.<br/><br/>With the exception of Vezzini, the abductors are not villains as we might initially perceive them to be. The marvelously choreographed swordplay between the man in black and Inigo, and the hilarious absurdity of the handfight with Fezzik, are not at all about winning or losing. They embody a sense of honor, sportsmanship, and nobility that is rarely exemplified in competition (both fictional and real).<br/><br/>Inigo, Fezzik, and the man in black do not display their skills pretentiously or flauntingly. Instead, they take a strong sense of inner pride in the subtle mastery of their arts. As a result, when we see them engage in competition, there is not a sense of enmity, but a wonderful air of camaraderie.<br/><br/>Also included in the mix are a sadistic count (Christopher Guest) with an odd physical characteristic and a penchant for pain, an albino (Mel Smith) with a stuffy throat, the deadly wrath of an R.O.U.S., and a clergyman (Peter Cook) who makes Elmer Fudd seem eloquently spoken. Most memorable, perhaps, is the appearance of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the miracle-man Max and his wife. It has been reported that in the middle of filming this scene, Reiner was forced to leave the set, because Crystal's improvisations were causing him to laugh to the point of being sick.<br/><br/>Regarding the film's casting, every single choice, without exception, is absolute perfection. Cary Elwes not only easily looks the part of a daring, ingenious hero, but as an actor, he has an incredible gift for a subtle mixture of drama and comedy, one that easily coincides with the film's sensibilities. Robin Wright easily essays the role of the headstrong princess, endlessly devoted to her love (with a convincing British accent, despite her American origins).<br/><br/>For the scene of swordplay, Elwes and Patinkin had to study fencing for months, which is impressive, but on-screen, I had no trouble believing that they were characters who had studied for at least several years. Despite his limited acting ability, wrestler Andre the Giant is perfect for the role of Fezzik, and something would be lost with any other actor in his place. And of course, Wallace Shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the diminutive, perpetually exasperated Vezzini.<br/><br/>We also don't have to hear Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon speak any lines to know they are portraying villains. The arrogance, callousness, and sliminess are readily apparent in their facial and bodily expressions.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, we have witnessed a wide variety of hilarity, captivating acts of love and heroism, and of course, one of the most satisfying acts of retribution ever put on film (one that immortalizes the film's most famous quote and chooses just the right time and placement for the film's sole swear word).<br/><br/>For someone who watches this film for the first time, and quickly catches on to the film's capricious mix of reverence and satire, the film is a marvel to watch simply for the knowledge that you do not know what will come next. Will there be a touching moment? A reflective one? An act of bravado? Or will our expectations be subverted in an act of comical subterfuge? The answer: any of them will do, as the film has a delectable variety of all of them.<br/><br/>From start to finish, The Princess Bride is a transcendent, magical experience that constantly elicits uproarious laughter and simultaneously immerses the audience in a rich, magnificent, and almost nostalgic world of folklore that, after the end credits roll, seems timeless and undying. In the years since its release in 1987, it has grown into a cult film of legendary status, and judging by the wide variety of ages I witnessed at the screening (as well as the endless barrage of quoting), it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that the film will endure for many years to come.",
    "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) is more than a sequel to a cult classic film from The Evil Dead (1981) this film is more of a prequel to the Army of Darkness (1992) that was made 5. years later. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is my number 1 favorite film best Evil Dead movie in the franchise. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I love this film to death and I love it so damn much. I enjoy this film a lot, it is one of my favorite movie's in the trilogy. <br/><br/>This is a great movie fun gory entertaining kick-ass sequel. It has action, comedy and horror mixed together that is why I love this film to death! Bruce Campbell is pure fun bad-ass Ash I absolutely love him in this sequel. I miss the 80's and that really best action gory movies un like they are today.<br/><br/>This sequel to the original movie is the perfect balance between the horror of the original and the silliness of the third installment. It succeeds because it has fun with the \"B\" movie genre, never claiming to be better than it is while employing witty direction and dialogue. The scene I remember most is when blood splashes on the lightbulb, making the room glow red. <br/><br/>The first time I watch it, this film really confused me a lot because I thought it was sequel to The Evil Dead but it had a lot of changes, which I love that. I have enjoyed a lot of this film, it is one of my second favorite movie's of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is pure fun and it's witty. Don't get me wrong I love both of Evil Dead films, but I just prefer Army of Darkness more, because it has funny scenes and it has a happy ending, those two films doesn't have happy endings, that is why I love Army of Darkness much better. The film it is just more of the same thing. Literally. But don't take that as such a negative thing. With the success of the low-budget original under his belt, director Sam Raimi re-imagined his first draft and added many elements he just did not have either the time or the money to accomplish on the first pass. On some level, the film certainly works as a nightmare that has to be replayed by our poor reluctant hero Ash. second Evil pairing of writer-director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell doesn't pick up from where the first Evil Dead left off, it instead reinvents some of the same characters from the first film, notably Campbell's daffy hero Ash and putative girlfriend Linda (played by Denise Bixler in this film), and plops them back in the same basic plot setup as the first film, in a kind of horror-comedy Groundhog Day scenario.<br/><br/>Once again Ash visits an isolated cabin in the woods, turns on a tape recorder that has a professor spouting verbiage from the Necronomicon, and the next thing you know, all hell has broken loose, quite literally. Raimi is a director who may not win points for finesse, but he works in a manic, breathless style that is perfectly suited for the outré black comedy of the Evil Dead franchise, and that devil may care, throw caution to the wind spirit is what has made the Evil Dead trilogy (Army of Darkness was the third film, though there's evidently a Raimi-Campbell remake of the original Evil Dead in the offing) such a cult sensation and what continues to draw audiences to the films to this day. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is an extremely gruesome affair, but it's also laugh out loud hilarious a lot of the time, with Campbell's intentionally arch delivery and wide-eyed crazed, cartoonish performance style making the most of Raimi and co-scenarist Scott Speigel's reinvention of the Evil Dead premise. <br/><br/>Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is really a sly, if sometimes sinister, comedy, one blacker than, well, death, but which delivers some consistent guffaws mixed in with the more typical \"avert your eyes\" blood and guts.<br/><br/>Ash (Bruce Campbell), the sole survivor of THE EVIL DEAD, returns to the same cabin in the woods and again unleashes the forces of the dead. With his girlfriend possessed by the demons and his body parts running amok, Ash is forced to single- handedly battle the legions of the damned as the most lethal - and groovy - hero in horror movie history! Welcome to EVIL DEAD II, director Sam Raimi's infamous sequel to THE EVIL DEAD and outrageous prequel to ARMY OF DARKNESS!<br/><br/>Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is a 1987 American horror comedy film directed by Sam Raimi and a parody sequel to the 1981 film The Evil Dead. The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration Crimewave), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.<br/><br/>I love this film and Army of Darkness!!!!",
    "William Shakespeare's famous tragedy is brought to the screen on a large scale. Full of his intricate and unique style of writing, this play focuses on Macbeth.\n....\nWhat I did not expect to see is that the landscape of Scotland becomes not just the scenery background but one of the main storytelling streams. One sees too many modern adaptations of Japanese interpretation of Macbeth that one seems to forget where the story came from in the first place. Truly magnificent cinematography in this version of Macbeth and it really lives up to bloodbath on the battlefields as stated in the Bard' s words. One of the best movies in 2015",
    "Completely brilliant. This film is amazing in its characterization, its pacing, its character development and its visuals.\nThe book is superb, but Stanley is a genius who has a midas touch.<br/><br/>Glory glory violence.",
    "I was reluctant to see this movie. As a veteran of Desert Shield/Storm, I spent my first 90 days in-theater in the Weapons Co of A Swofford's Battalion. I later was moved to the 1st Bn of 7th Marines, but having been in the same unit for some of the same time I felt I could offer readers a unique perspective on the film's accuracy.<br/><br/>From a purely aesthetic perspective I thought the film was well done. The acting was very good, and the script was well written, witty, and accurate. The actors were well suited to their roles. My personal preference for a good plot would have been disappointed were it not for my personal interest in the film. In my opinion this film is an outstanding dramatic-documentary, so adjust your expectations accordingly. If you are expecting a driving plot line and all the accompanying dramatic tension, then I think you will be disappointed (as many whose comments I heard exiting the theater certainly were). But if you think of it as a chance to take a glimpse into a point in history, and see it as some of those who lived it did, then I think you will be impressed.<br/><br/>Many people may think that the obscenity of some of the interactions was overdone for effect. But whatever anyone's personal judgment of that behavior, that is the closest portrayal of Marines (or soldiers) being themselves I have yet seen on screen. Marines are vulgar. They do watch porn. They do fight among themselves. They do both hate, and love, the Marine Corps. There is an omni-present anti-war conspiracy theorist. The do say ridiculous things. There are some who are over the line. The reality of the Marine Infantry is that things happen there every day that are well beyond conventional sensibility, and which strain credibility to the average civilian. It's all true. I love the Marine Corps and I am still serving - I don't have an axe to grind. It just happens to be true.<br/><br/>Are there parts of the film that I find incredible? Yes. But they are not the essential things. There is a scene, it's even in the trailer, in which everyone is firing their weapon into the air. I wasn't there, but I can't fathom a breach of discipline on that scale. I can't say it's impossible, but I am doubtful. But whether it's true or not is not important. At its essence this is a film about Marines, how they adjusted to the Marine Corps, each other, and a war. If there are a few incredible details, then we can just be grateful that Hollywood didn't impose a car-chase on us.<br/><br/>This is a film about Marines. At that time, there were very few who turned down scholarships to Ivy League schools to come in. We were from strange backgrounds. We were obscene. We did want to get our kills. Many of us were frustrated that our war was only 100 hrs long. We knew we were filling the footsteps of giants - the Marines of Iwo, The Chosin, Belleau Wood - and I think we all wanted a chance to earn a place next to those men. In our wild, adrenalized youth, those aspirations just took the crude form of looking for a kill. Or at least that's how I've put it in perspective 15 years later.<br/><br/>If you go and see this film, try to recall yourself at 18 (as I was). Suspend your judgment of the obscenity and vulgarity until you're sure you would've done it differently. I can't speak for Swofford, but I am still incredibly proud of my service there. The insanity of this film reminds me why: because it is characteristic of the immense hardship that our youth bears on behalf of the rest. Do the characters look stressed? It's not hyperbole. We were 18 and we thought we were going to die over there. Still, at H-Hour, everyone marched North. In my opinion, you better fill some big shoes before you judge that. <br/><br/>So don't go into this film champing at the bit to pigeon-hole it as \"Anti\" or \"Pro\" war, with all the pre-fab rhetoric that comes with such a judgment. You have an opportunity here to look back into our little moment in history. Swofford has invited you into our memories. They are not Right, and they are not Left, they are just our story as Swofford lived it. If that kind of thing interests you, then go and see this movie.",
    "As a huge Woody Allen fan, I was delighted and surprised by this film.  I have scarcely heard anyone mention it, but for my money it is the single most comically dense of all of Woody's films.  There are so many truly impressive/hilarious/memorable one-liners that I'm amazed people don't quote this movie left and right. The setting, costumes, accents all add to the hilarity of the film--truly reminiscent of a Marx Brothers romp.  Really outstanding among his pre-Annie Hall films.  Only rivaled by Bananas in my opinion for simple laugh value.<br/><br/>Unlike any other of his films, this deals with his \"deep\" questions of death/metaphysics in an unflaggingly light and comical fashion.  For instance:<br/><br/>Sonja: But judgment of any system or a priori relation of phenomena exists in any rational or metaphysical or at least epistemological contradiction to an abstracted empirical concept such as being or to be or to occur in the thing itself or of the thing itself.<br/><br/>Boris: Yeah, I've said that many times.<br/><br/>Not Woody's \"best\" film (see Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanors), but perhaps his most laugh-filled. Satisfying throughout.  I give it a 9/10.",
    "I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.<br/><br/>It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.<br/><br/>Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). <br/><br/>What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).<br/><br/>So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/",
    "Caution: spoilers may abound. I think this movie is severely underrated. Most complaints I see are of people who can't let go of the vision of superman they got from Christopher reeve who played a superman who was a god among men who never made mistakes and always knew what to do. That's not someone we relate to in this day and age because in our cynical and jaded society it's impossible to be that morally upright. I like Henry Cavill's superman because he plays a man who has to learn how to be superman. He's not perfect out the gate and he doesn't automatically know how to handle every situation right out the gate. Because of this a lot of lives are lost in the battle of metropolis and superman is forced to end zod because there is no other recourse because there is no way to contain him on earth with all the kryptonian tech is destroyed. Whatever you can say about how believable it is that superman didn't have a choice it's still set up well. Krypton was very beautiful and Russell Crowe made a great jor el. As far as the plot for the movie I understand the criticism that the flashbacks don't make sense but I think the death of Jonathan Kent is done very well because it's a sacrifice intended to keep Clark undercover. All in all its not perfect but it's far from terrible.",
    "I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this one isn't even in the TOP 100.<br/><br/>This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:<br/><br/>-The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.<br/><br/>-The Emperor was Finally Revealled: Well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw The Emperor as kids.<br/><br/>-The Speeder Bike Chase: Alright, so this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!<br/><br/>-The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Moment)<br/><br/>-The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.<br/><br/>All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story.",
    "How do I start? I love this film! It has a great plot line and incredible music. It is a fun musical that makes you want to get up and dance.<br/><br/>Grease is the story of Danny Zucko and Sandy Olsen (or Dumbruski) two high school seniors who fall in love over the summer. They have a wonderful summer together and are sad to see it end. The first day of school arrives and little does Danny know him and Sandy would soon be reunited. But Sandy is shocked to find the nice guy she meet at the beach is the leader of a greaser gang called 'The T'birds' Meanwhile Sandy is trying to fit in with her new \"friends\" the T'birds female counterparts The Pink Ladies. Will Sandy and Danny ever be together again? Along with this plot comes song that will be stuck in your head for centuries. Such songs include Summer Nights, Beauty School Dropout and the now famous song Greased Lightining. Grease is a timeless classic that will have you singing and dancing by the end of the movie.",
    "I loved this movie, it's so funny :D one of the best comedy movies ever!!! It has (like many movies) a message, that it's best to tell the truth, but above all it was very funny. My favorite scene was: <br/><br/>About Mr. Allen <br/><br/>Miranda: Well, what do you think of him? Fletcher: He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless steaming pile of cow dung, figuratively speaking. a moment passes and Mr. Allen starts laughing. The other board members follow his lead and start laughing also] Mr. Allen: That's the funniest damn thing I have ever heard. You're a real card, Reede. I love a good roast. Do Simmons. Fletcher: Simmons is old. He should have been out of the game years ago but he can't stay home because he hates his wife. You have met her at the Christmas parties, she's the one that gets plastered and calls him a retard, and you, Tom; you're the biggest brown nose I have ever seen. You have got your head so far up Mr. Allen's ass, I can't tell where you end and he begins. Mr. Allen: *roaring with laughter* Priceless! *Fletcher continues with every member* Fletcher: You have bad breath caused by gingivitis. You couldn't get a porn star off. Your hairpiece looks like something that was killed crossing the highway. I don't know whether to comb it or scrape it off with a shovel and bury it in lime. Loser! Idiot! Wimp! Degenerate! *Slut*! Mr. Allen: I like your style, Reede! That's just what this stuffy company needs - a little irreverence! Fletcher: Good! I'll see you later, dick-head! <br/><br/>Great movie!!!",
    "Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as \"Sergeant Major Dickerson\",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.",
    "Overall I enjoyed the movie. There have been too many recent films about the Tudors and Elizabeth in particular, but this film looks good and it keeps you entertained. It's set at the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Elizabeth is shown as tough, smart, and married to her country. She also suffers from bouts of insecurity and irrational jealousies. This film is more hagiographic and melodramatic than its predecessor. <br/><br/>The film tends to ignore the facts when they get in the way of the story. Elizabeth was 55 at the time of the Spanish Armada and she was never a looker. Blanchett's Queen is youngish and attractive. Blanchett's acting performance is powerful and impressive but also a bit stagy. The way the politics of the time are depicted is a bit too black and white. The Spanish look grim and are dressed in dark colors. They are portrayed as crazy, religious zealots. Spain had a right to be upset at English privateers / pirates who attacked their ships and stole their gold. Mary, Queen of Scots is shown as a dowdy, schemer who disliked Elizabeth. The reality was that Mary was a pretty bimbo who made bad choices when it came to men.<br/><br/>Parts of the film veer too much towards soap-opera. Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen)becomes a favorite, but when Bess Throckmorton, one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting and Raleigh get secretly married, Elizabeth becomes jealous and behaves badly. Later, Raleigh and Francis Drake are shown defeating the Spanish at sea. In reality Raleigh was looking after the coastal defenses in the South West of England and didn't marry Throckmorton until 1591. The real Raleigh was a brilliant man: soldier, explorer, writer, poet and courtier and probably deserves his own film. The film is good fun but it's simplistic, cartoon history.",
    "I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was simply delighted.<br/><br/>I saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie, but then found it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started trying to justify liking this flick on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going way overboard: the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man; (b) the extensive male-female humor arising out of that basic conceit; and (c) some of the names (including Viola & Duke).<br/><br/>Aside from those names, the thematic commonalties (a & b) are really great themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. Beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary/traditional teen flick. And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like alluding to Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The movie is bright, fast-paced, emotive, stylized, funny ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and male/female humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part IMHO: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing over-the-top fun. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately, with such a complexity of invention that I'm still a little bewildered ... but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard, it's not that kind of a movie: things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next split-second happening.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes really is just delightful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke; David Cross does a wonderfully over the top Principal Gold. All of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. Cinematography was excellent.<br/><br/>Wonderful entertainment from beginning to end ... check it out!",
    "Gravity is a wonderful work of art. Cuaron and Lubezki are at their visual storytelling bests, which is quite a statement. The shots of outer space are long and gorgeous, and the sound design is impeccable, both encompassing the vastness and silence of space as well as letting us see Ryan's perspective. The grounded, careful science of the film and the exceptional effects and camera work give us a sense of what space is like - a tall order. What brings Gravity to the next level is the level of personal connection we reach with Kowalski, and especially Ryan. I felt nervous and scared every time Ryan was faced with a seemingly impossible situation. It is so impressive that Cuaron could get us to connect with Ryan and make every moment so thrilling despite having next to no dialogue and only having two characters in the whole film! The scene where Kowalski returns and enters the shuttle was far and away the scene of the movie for me, especially as it hit me that it was in her mind. The score is effective in heightening tension. Gravity is a groundbreaking work of art that, despite its narrow focus on just Ryan's journey, he manages to both amaze us visually and thrill us, start to finish.",
    "Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original \"Willy Wonka\" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",
    "My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.<br/><br/>\nFor someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:\n<ul><li>Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.</li><li>The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular \"Nolan's spirit\" in it.</li><li>The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.</li><li>Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.</li><li>Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/>\nSPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!<br/><br/>It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - \"extractors\" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of steeling, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called \"inception\". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels \"dream within a dream\", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.<br/><br/>The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.<br/><br/>\nSome short lines about the cast:\n<ul><li>Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.</li><li>Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).</li><li>There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...</li><li>Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.</li><li>Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.</li><li>Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.</li><li>Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.</li></ul>",
    "Even before the final credits rolled, I strongly suspected this movie would end up on my Top 20; in fact, perhaps even my Top 10. A teenage boy, his hearing impaired from having just been at the site of a bombing, and a young woman clutching at him, the two of them stumbling and sludging through a slimy, smelly bog. A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don't need vast, elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers' comments on the movie, it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most \"satisfying\". A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn't really get going until the second half. For me, it was the first half that got under my skin the most, for its cinematic originality, poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement, but it's only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman, defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also, never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed, and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema, rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn't always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See, rape is shown as nothing but pure, unadulterated, hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial, external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film, you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars. <br/><br/>On another subject, whoever thinks this movie contains \"propaganda\" is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it's a Soviet production, and should think things over a little more carefully. It's astonishing how you can still find little traces of the Cold War mentality surviving to this day, even in younger viewers... The fact that as detractors of Come and See claim, Stalin \"was no better than Hitler\" has nothing to do with anything at all, in this movie's context - Klimov's picture is NOT about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant - it's about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war - ANY war, though this one happened to be going on in Bielorussia. There was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan than the whole of Come and See. This is painful, sublime cinema. I've always believed there's something special about Russians when it comes to producing art, especially literature - this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression in me.",
    "Like many of you, the first time I saw the trailer for The Lego Movie (2014) I thought to myself, \"Are you kidding me?!\" Yet another movie based on a franchise of toys aimed towards families willing to cough up the cash just to shut their kids up. Can't we for once make movies for kids that don't dull the senses? Have we truly come to the point where there are no original thoughts? Yet after seeing not just families but college kids' line up to see sold out viewings I became interested. In addition, The Lego Movie managed to muster a staggering 93% on rottentomatoes.com, an unheard of fresh score in the February film graveyard. In short; curiosity got the best of me.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong about this film. I honestly couldn't have been more wrong about a film in my life. The Lego Movie is not only the must see film of the late winter season, I'm going to go ahead and call it now; it's the best family-oriented film for all ages of 2014. Okay maybe not but at the very least it's a very high bar to set.<br/><br/>The story busts out of the gate from the get-go; Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) a wizard and \"master builder\", while protecting a mystery weapon is blinded by Lord Business (Will Ferrell), obviously our caped and big booted villain. Before Vitruvius is kicked into the abyss by Business and his robotic minions, he foretells of a hero, the \"special\" who will put an end to his dastardly plans, whatever they might be. The next morning Emmet a seemingly ordinary Lego construction worker goes about his normal day. He comes across a woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for \"the piece of resistance\" which he unwittingly finds and becomes beholden to. Now it's up to Emmet and some newfound friends to fulfill the prophecy.<br/><br/>It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. Yet within The Lego Movie's brick-blocked world, everything including the story feels incredibly new and original. Children, especially the young will enjoy the fast action, laugh-a-minute jokes, sly slapstick and goofy characters. Obvious kid favorites will include perma-smiled Unikitty (Alison Brie) and zany 80's throwback astronaut Benny (Charlie Day) whose ability to create spaceships is frustratingly overlooked. Plus there's Batman (Will Arnett)Batman! <br/><br/>The older crowd however will be astounded not only with the seamless CGI effects but with the subversive element throughout the film. Yes a goofy, kiddy film of such unrestrained chirpiness can be positively incendiary, at least in this case. Throughout the film there are Orwellian elements tucked underneath crafty pop-culture references ranging from Star Wars (1977) to Harry Potter. There are mischievous pokes at what Henry David Thoreau referred to as \"(leading) lives of quite desperation.\" <br/><br/>Finally there's cheeky satire aimed at the Danish toy brand itself. Much of the conflict revolves around \"master builders\" who build whatever they want out of the parts they find versus Lord Business who wants everything built \"according to the directions.\" This particular theme struck the kid inside me as I was very fond of Legos. Younglings may not realize that back in the day, pre-designed Lego play sets took a back seat to the now impossible to find Lego Creative Bucket sets. To the uninitiated that particular red bucket set was an amalgam of potential foot sores but to this writer, those 200+ pieces were a gateway to an unlimited creative space.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie accurately and effectively recreates that creative space through accessible movie magic. It exhibits a fun hero story that may not be treading new narrative ground but nonetheless feels fresh and new. Finally the themes and occasionally biting humor makes The Lego Movie a kid's film that isn't just for kids but the child in all of us. This February do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an adventure story unlike any other. Then go home and order some Legos online! I know I am.",
    "First of all, it is an Adam Sandler movie. If you hate Adam Sandler movies, then you won't like this.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8/10 because it was one of the better Adam Sandler movies. The plot and storyline was better than I expected; the development was pretty good as well. There were definitely a lot of points where I had to slap my forehead b/c it was silly funny.<br/><br/>Yeah, its highly unrealistic, but if you expected realism, whats wrong with you? Sure, Jennifer Anniston is the \"uglier chick,\" which is like saying a million dollars isn't that much money, but she did a good job in the movie.<br/><br/>The only complaint I had was Adam Sandler used all the lines I planned on using with the girl I took to see it!",
    "I'll start this off with a warning. If you're a mainstream horror fan, you will not like this. It is not The Conjuring, it does not have jump scares, it is a slow movie. It's not scary in the way that most horror films are scary. It doesn't frighten you. It felt traumatic. This is an artsy movie for sure. If you don't like that, don't see it.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh is absolutely phenomenal. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invensted in such a disturbing film. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunningly gorgeous. I've never seen a film look so gory and grotesque and yet absolutely beatiful at the same time. It's some of the best cinematography that I've seen in years. The art direction is also phenomenal in providing us with a floral, candy colored, nightmare world.<br/><br/>And Ari Aster's screenplay and direction is what makes this so special and separates it from other horror pieces. It's slow, methodical, eerie. But the characters are psychological and deep. The dialogue is real and colorful. The plot is surreal and disturbing. He let's the scares crawl at you as opposed to jump at you. He allows you to see what will happen, process it, feel the shock of what's about to happen, and then still shock you even more when it happens.<br/><br/>This film will be divisive. I have no doubt that many people here will hate this. However, while this is a challenging film, it's also a great film. Halfway through a character says something along the lines of \"That was so messed up, but I'm trying to keep an open mind.\" I suggest that audiences take this advice.<br/><br/>PSA, this movie is extremely violent, bloody, and gory. It's pretty horrifying and it could have stuff that is triggering.",
    "I can believe this movie will be a serious disappointment for a person, who is used to and likes to watch Hollywood war movies. Four reasons: 1. It's made in a world, where movie makers tries to have some personality. If you think 'When We Were Soldiers'... well, there are hundreds of directors who you can imagine making a similar war movie with personality and values of a hamburger.<br/><br/>2. Screenplay has a different structure. There's no shocking opening scene like in 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie starts slowly in a very nice place and ends slowly in a very bad place, without hope or feeling that the characters have achieved something by their heroic actions.<br/><br/>3. It is first a movie about lost causes in the world of war, and only secondly a war movie which takes place in Stalingrad.<br/><br/>4. War scenes portray the horror, insecurity and confusion of a battle, instead of how cool, heroic and exciting fighting looks like. In this sense, this movie is closer to reality than most of the war movies you will ever see. 'Thin Red Line' also had similar \"I would probably crap in my pants in that situation\"-feeling.<br/><br/>Stalingrad, whether you think it as a movie or a war movie has so many good things in it... like honesty. Even the ordinary German soldiers were dreaming about farms in Russia when they were advancing. What a disappointment they must have had in Stalingrad! If you like to watch war movies, meaning also other war movies than When We Were Soldiers or Saving Private Ryan, you should see this one. (9/10)",
    "I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like \"Mr. Woodcock\" and \"Good Luck Chuck,\" movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.<br/><br/>\"Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!\" <br/><br/>\"He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!\" <br/><br/>No. Die.<br/><br/>Knocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with. Needless to say, he's the reason the movie works.",
    "I've watched this film for the third time in a few years last night. Instead of writing a straight review, I'd like to jot down ten thoughts just off the top of my head concerning this exquisite movie: <br/><br/>1) Watching this film will change forever your perception of the bank heist genre, making you question the contrived cinematic conventions these films usually make use of.<br/><br/>2) The source of this film's paradoxical and/or farcical elements spring from life itself, not from film or pre-existing cinematic conventions. Sometimes, the absurdities of life are so great, they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point, this film captures that concept beautifully. <br/><br/>3) Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time, even, in hardly making an issue out of it at all - it just IS. <br/><br/>4) It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober, you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.<br/><br/>5) Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero, with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash, bloated, childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.<br/><br/>6) Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. **SPOILERS**: Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car, where he doesn't say a word, but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie; you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live! <br/><br/>7) Watching this film, you'll realise that firing a gun-shot is a BIG DEAL in real life, and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way. <br/><br/>8) All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move away you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way. <br/><br/>9) No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness, inspiration and talent. <br/><br/>10) Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive film-making as it did first time round.",
    "I'm finding it hard to see why this film has taken such a tongue lashing (or keyboard lashing) by some people...<br/><br/>mostly it is said that the main character is selfish and self indulgent, and that this film builds him up to be some kind of hero..<br/><br/>but I think that's missing the point...<br/><br/>through-out I was thinking about how, on one hand it was admirable that he wanted to break from the materialistic, money grabbing oppressive shackles placed on us by modern society, but on the other, how he had gone about it in such an irresponsible, hurtful and self-righteous way...<br/><br/>the way he abandoned his parents and loving sister without a phone call note or explanation, and from the people he met along the way, like the kind old man and young romance, especially compounded this...<br/><br/>and ultimately he realised this at the end by scribbling into a book, \"happiness only real when shared\" surely that is the lesson here! that his selfish, hurtful adolescent behaviour was wrong, and he ultimately paid a terrible cost.<br/><br/>So ignore that haters...they are looking at this story the wrong way! Very much worth an open minded viewing!",
    "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \"Scarface\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \"American Dream\".<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about the \"cheesiness\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.<br/><br/>This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.<br/><br/>The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.<br/><br/>Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \"Scarface\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",
    "Because I lived in Sierra Leone, in fact in Kono, the diamond-mining area of the country, for three years, I had to see Blood Diamond as soon as it came out. It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio's performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I've ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. This movie just gets so many things right that the few places it departs from reality are entirely forgivable. I would heartily recommend this movie to everyone; it is the best Hollywood movie I've seen in years.",
    "I found myself really enjoying SULTAN. Ali knows how to push all the right buttons to keep the audience engaged. Ali's writing and directing are flawless. This is without a doubt Ali's best ever movie. Nushki is an acting diva and she is making her way to be the next great actress since Aishwarya Rai. I love love love Nushki, I truly adore her and always will. She's my love ;) xxx I must confess that I could watch Nushki in almost anything, but here she really delivers a performance that may be her best yet . . . and I've seen almost all of her work. Nushki elevates herself to a league of her own. She is a beautiful girl who is talented enough when playing \"regular\" characters, such as the journalist in \"PK\". But as a high profile corporate executive in \"NH10\" and in this film as a musclebound wrestler, she takes it to a level most female actors couldn't. You can tell how hard she worked to make this role believable because when she wrestles you forget it is Anushka Sharma in the ring. SK is always a pleasure to watch. Here his character's sizzling chemistry with Nushki is completely adorable and that moments of sweetness will surely MELT your heart. SK gives an incredible performance that will undoubtedly propel his career. Overall it is one motion picture that should never be missed nor put aside when selecting movies to be seen on a weekend. SULTAN is a sure winner for all.",
    "`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.<br/><br/>And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.<br/><br/>Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.<br/><br/>The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.<br/><br/>O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",
    "This film is the equivalent to a sixteen year old, fairly privileged middle class boy, who has a baseball cap, curtains and t-shirt with the marijuana leaf on it yet has only ever smoked one spliff and made a huge deal about it. He thinks that smoking weed makes him relevant. So he needs to let everyone know he does it because there's nothing else that will appeal about him. Because he doesn't want to come off as a nerd, he lowers his intelligence and because he is too 'dumb' to actually be funny, he swears every 10 seconds to constitute humour. Possibly still faps over that one single poster of a tanned girl in a bikini that his Uncle bought him on his birthday because he was 'becoming a man, bro.'<br/><br/>It was described to my boyfriend as 'offensive'. It wasn't. It's vulgar. It's not even the funny kind.<br/><br/>I watched it last night with my boyfriend. Only us and a group of three 'lads' were in the cinema. Understand, we all laughed more during the adverts and trailers than we did the actual movie.<br/><br/>Within the first five minutes, I was embarrassed that I subjected my boyfriend and I to this and knew it was going to disappoint me.<br/><br/>Immediately, you're met with profanity. Now, once or twice to give the impression that hot dogs swear is fine. Swearing so much to substitute for lack of humour is just pathetic. Amidst the language, nothing funny was said. That's bad writing.<br/><br/>There's the joke that hot dogs are having sex with buns when they're put into the buns. That makes sense as a joke. It's a safe bet. This would have been modestly funny had it not been repeated throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Yes, we get it. The sausage is a phallic shape and goes into a bun.<br/><br/>It really puts it to you within the first few minutes. A pack of sausages shaming each other about their size and shape. (BECAUSE THEY ARE METAPHORICAL PENISES DON'T YOU KNOW! HAR HAR!) Again though, not funny or clever. Then courting the lady-buns by being vulgar. Sausage calls bun a b***h.<br/><br/>It was clear that I'd sat us down for an uninspired and lazy flop.<br/><br/>I laughed modestly twice. I laughed out of obligation and embarrassment about 5 times.<br/><br/>There were a few clever bits. I am a fan of wordplay, so to see someone riding a bottle of 'Horseradish Sauce' was satisfying. The Frankfurters were played as Nazis who hated 'Juice' and their symbol was 'ff', made to look the Nazi alternative. Offensive, yes, but a little clever. I like offensive humour.<br/><br/>There were so many opportunities for actual humour it hurts. Nothing that could have been funny was displayed for more than a second.<br/><br/>There was a graphic rape scene.<br/><br/>I get that it sounds ridiculous when you hear that it's a douche forcefully sucking the juice out of a carton.<br/><br/>You might think I am being silly, but I swear to you, if it had been humans, it would have been pretty horrific.<br/><br/>Because it was a cartoon, you were expected to laugh at rape.<br/><br/>Ha ha. No. I don't think any of the viewers found that funny, even the 'laddish' blokes at the back didn't crack a humoured grin.<br/><br/>There's also this really awkward sex scene at the end where all the food engage. This is to really bring home the hot-dog/penis metaphor.<br/><br/>A taco has lesbian sex with a bread roll.<br/><br/>My fingers hurt from typing.<br/><br/>If you're 12 years old and completely new to sex, drugs and swearwords, you and your dude-bros will love this.<br/><br/>If you require a little more maturity and intelligence in your humour, AVOID. Otherwise you'll leave needing to take a shower and needing to withdraw from cinema.",
    "I always thought Captain America was a corny \"golden age of comics\" superhero that had long passed his expiration date. I was shocked by how much I liked him in his first film. I was delighted to grow to like him even more in this one. They set up the character beautifully in the first movie, but he explodes as a hero here. It's hard to fault the character or this movie. Not just the MC, but the whole cast was well written and acted here. The action is well directed and tense. Battles feel much more real than most Marvel battles. There was much less obvious CGI than most films in the franchise, and it pays off. This is one of the best Marvel films to date. Lightning in a bottle. A highlight in the MCU.",
    "Over the years Akshay Kumar's choice of selecting the films has certainly improved with significant examples being Holiday, Baby, Special Chabbis, Gabbar Is Back to name few. Move over commercial masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single blow and typical song-dance routine – Raja Menon's Airlift will give you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitement.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Airlift speaks about the Ranjit Katyal (played by Akshay Kumar) who helps the Indian Government collaborate with Air India to help evacuate 1,70,000 Indians from Kuwait after Iraq raided the country.<br/><br/>From the director of critical acclaimed films like Bas Yun Hi and Barah Aana, Raja Menon does a fantastic research about the feat that was even recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record and surprisingly people are unaware about it. Airlift will consume you right from the beginning especially when Akshay's family faces the issue of Iraqi raiding Kuwait. From here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. The music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. The soulful number such as 'Soch Na Sake' is already a superhit among the viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.<br/><br/>It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. After giving back-to-back hits in 2015 with Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Singh Is Bliing, Akshay Kumar is definitely on a roll. With Holiday, Baby and now Airlift, Akshay Kumar has managed to create a image of \"Mera Bharat Mahaan\" actor and fans will love him in new avatar. The fresh pairing of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur works well. Nimrat Kaur's realistic subtlety would harness Akshay Kumar's machismo and give us that perfect thriller<br/><br/>Overall , Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4.5/5",
    "«We didn't need dialogs, we had faces» said the narcissistic Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in Billy Wilder' \"Sunset Boulevard\", referring to the Silent Era, when she used to be big  before the 'pictures got small'.<br/><br/>The reason of this introduction is that after watching Michel Hazanavicius' critically acclaimed: \"The Artist\", I strongly felt this was the perfect illustration to Norma Desmond's iconic eulogy. From beginning to end, my eyes never ceased to be amazed by the communicative smile of Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, the aging silent movie star and the sparkling eyes of Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, the young and flamboyant starlet. Their faces occupy the screen with such an electrifying magnetism that they don't just steal the scenes, they steal the dialogs  literally.<br/><br/>I was awestruck by Dujardin's performance. To those who didn't grew up with French TV programs, he's one of the most popular and talented comedians of his generation. Dujardin created the character of Brice de Nice, a blonde surfer whose specialty was to 'diss people', but it was so funny it never sounded mean-spirited. He was a member of a cult comic-troop (who made sketches à la SNL) but even back then, he had a little something that made him special: a voice, a smile, a charisma in both TV and movies, in both dramatic and comedic register. There was no doubt in France that the guy who was famous for his impressions of Robert De Niro and the camel (and even De Niro doing the camel) was promised to a brilliant career.<br/><br/>Look closely at Jean Dujardin's face, it's like drawn with 'classic' features: the finely traced mustache who builds a Fairbanks-like charisma like the strength from Samson's hair, the dazzling smile making him look like the lost son of Gene Kelly, and a certain macho toughness reminding of a young Sean Connery. Dujardin's face is a gift from cinematic Gods, and \"The Artist\" finally lets it glide, earning him the Cannes Festival Award for Best Actor. I sincerely believe he deserves an Oscar nomination, because he just doesn't play an actor from the Silent Era, he embodies the Era with the same level of demented craziness as Norma Desmond, in a brighter and more light-hearted side.<br/><br/>Valentin's self-absorption echoes Desmond's cynical ego while his gaudy 'Don Lockwood' mask (Gene Kelly in \"Singin' in the Rain\") hides the more poignant face of his insecurity. He's the star of the screen because only the screen allows him to express his unique talent. While Lockwood had to adapt to the 'talking' revolution, George Valentin makes a conservative U Turn starting an inexorable descent into madness, from an outcast, to a has-been until being finally alienated by his own talkie-phobia. The direction is so clever that it challenges many times our perceptions, creating unexpected feelings of discomfort when real sounds are heard. But I was surprised to see how much it worked on a dramatic level.<br/><br/>And this is the strength of the film, although I expect it to discomfort some viewers: it isn't a tribute in the literary meaning of the word. It has its moments where it tricks us into the use of sounds or dialogs, but never fails to distract us from the core of the story: the romance. Very quickly, we forget about spotting the hints, the references to silent classics: chase scenes, over-the-top comical gesticulations, slapstick jokes etc. This mindset would disappoint those who expected a film with the same material as Mel Brook's \"Silent Movie\", which was clearly a tribute. \"The Artist\" IS a silent movie, featuring a beautiful romance between George and Peppy, who got her break with an idea from George, something that would make her different from the other actresses: a beauty spot above the upper lip. A clever credit-billing montage depicts her consequent ascension to stardom until she finally dethrones George and makes a has-been out of him.<br/><br/>If I mentioned the performance of Dujardin, Berenice Bejo also deserves some accolades because she succeeded in looking so \"old\" from our POV yet so fresh and modern in the film, with the appealing feel-good and optimistic attitude she constantly brings on screen. With her doll-face and youngish smile, she's like a cute little girl enjoying what she does. In a way, Peppy Miller embodies the film's most inspirational element: a positive message about passion and enjoyment. And this indirectly highlights George's source of troubles: being deprived from what he enjoyed the most and suffering from his progressive fading into oblivion. Along with this conflict, the evolution of George and Peppy's romance never feels forced, quite an accomplishment when we consider how slightly over-the-top silent movie stars used to act.<br/><br/>Both Dujardin and Bejo are indeed powerful in an Oscar-worthy level and at that moment, I can't continue without mentioning the third character of the film, George's dog. The relationship between George and the dog provides a sort of Chaplinesque feel to the movie, a mix of tenderness and poignancy, so natural and convincing I wonder if the Academy will think of a honorary Oscar. Anyway, I applaud Hazanivicius for not having reduced \"The Artist\" to a flashy spectacle with no substance, with the word 'homage' as the director's convenient alibi, and make a touching romance about two people who met each other at a pivotal time in the history of film-making, each representing a side of cinema, the old-school silent generation: Chaplin, Keaton, Pickford and the exuberant talkers: Grant, Hepburn, Davis  And I'm glad he found the true note to reconcile between these two universes at the end  didn't I tell you Dujardin was the lost son of Gene Kelly?<br/><br/>\"The Artist\" plays like a missing link between \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" and it's indeed one of the best films of 2011, with the absence of words as an endearing 'beauty spot'.",
    "Opening up with the shooting of Aldos Snow's latest music video and then showing his downward spiral that leads to present day was the hilarious, perfect beginning for this innovative comedic spin-off. If you saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' then this is exactly what you would expect a movie about Aldos Snow to be like. This movie has a heart that I did not expect to see, it's buried under lewd, vulgar and brilliant wit, but it's in there.<br/><br/>Russell Brand just opens his mouth and his words are comedic gold. Jonah Hill takes a step out of his comfort zone, a bit, and plays a \"no confidence good guy\". (Usually he's the overconfident prick, for all you naysayers). Diddy delivers a surprisingly strong performance that I'm sure shocked anyone who sees him. He's actually hilarious! His repartee with everyone he comes into contact with is spot-on. The entire cast has hilarious one-liners and the two main characters really make this movie a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The plot is actually a creative one, something we don't see a lot of nowadays. Albeit the humor treads into \"familiar gross-out\" jokes, there are clever jokes too. But it's all you have to expect when following \"Rock and Roll personified\". Another point I was surprised by was that a lot... a lot of the scenes from the trailers were not in the movie. I thought that was a good and bad thing. Good because it didn't show us stuff we've already seen and gave us the chance to see new stuff. But bad because a few of the scenes were real funny.<br/><br/>For the critics who are hating this movie: Do you like comedy? Do you like Apatow's stuff? Do you like Russell Brand or Jonah Hill? If the answer is no to any 2 of these... why are you reviewing this movie? Your opinion is pointless for the people that actually DO like these movies.",
    "I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action, suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about. This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is one amazing movie.",
    "An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.<br/><br/>Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.<br/><br/>Many details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation, but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However, a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here, hence, though the story moves quickly enough, there is always the feeling that for an action-thriller, there aren't enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren't exciting or grand enough.<br/><br/>But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence didn't do as well here as in the last film, probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog, his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.<br/><br/>Emotionally, this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it's partly because I know what is coming, but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it's because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions - nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.<br/><br/>It is still a movie that can be enjoyed though, and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don't feel for the characters, you won't care about the film.",
    "I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world. <br/><br/>For starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. <br/><br/>The creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. <br/><br/>However there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. <br/><br/>Still these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn't flawless by any means it's certainly entertaining!",
    "We are all familiar with the story and with Steven Hawking. His groundbreaking work 'A brief History of Time' and devastating disabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness and immortal fame.<br/><br/>But few of us could understand the complexities of his personal life and the shocking divorce in 1990 from his long sacrificing wife of more than 25 years. Indeed that episode served to darken his reputation in the minds of many, including myself, who felt ill at ease with anyone who could leave a partner who had done so much for him just at the long awaited moment when international fame and recognition finally arrived.<br/><br/>This wonderful production, so well scripted and paced throughout, serves to explain that vital anomaly in Hawking's life. And it is made all the more poignant as it is based upon the account written by his wife who has borne so much.<br/><br/>But it is the breathtaking performance of Eddie Redmayne as Hawking that simply blasted this film into an extraordinary level. It is difficult enough to mimic so famous a person as Hawking and it is even more difficult to portray so accurately the debilitating and gradually increasing effects of Motor Neuron Disease. But to transmit so clearly the profound emotions and inner suffering that Hawking must have experienced in his agonizing journey was a performance that left me quite speechless and at times in uncontrollable tears.<br/><br/>It would be a travesty of the industry if Eddie Redmayne is not nominated for an Oscar after this performance. And to my mind it was a work of art that simply cannot be equaled let alone beaten.<br/><br/>Have a good handkerchief ready to hand.",
    "Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?  If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.<br/><br/>There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).<br/><br/>In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.<br/><br/>As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",
    "(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was \"dazed and exhausted\" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)<br/><br/>Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'.  So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being \"wowed\" by each frame visually.  How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life?  \"Heck\" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...).  Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!).  But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color.  No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story.  But, I'm glad to say, it's not!  A Bug's Life has real heart.   Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!  Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think!  Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has.  This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing.  The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots.  Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not \"dumbing down\" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.  All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point.  Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?",
    "While book racks are brimming with thought provoking, high concept science fiction, the movie genre tends to be populated by invading aliens, intergalactic wars, and adventure, which makes Director and co-writer Duncan Jones' Moon that much more of an oddity.<br/><br/>Not since Steven Soderbergh's much overlooked 2002 rendition of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris has a movie firmly rooted in the sci-fi realm delivered reflections on the human condition, which Moon does deftly.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only inhabitant of an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from lunar rocks to be shipped back to Earth to fuel the energy starved planet.<br/><br/>Sam's isolated three year posting is about to come to an end and he longs to return to Earth to see his wife. His only company throughout this sojourn has been that of Gerty, the base's HAL-like robot voiced by Kevin Spacey. Unfortunately, the final weeks and days are proving to be the most difficult, and Sam finds himself going a bit squirrelly, leaving both he and the audience to wonder if what's unfolding is actually happening, or merely a drama taking place in his addled mind.<br/><br/>That's about as much plot detail as I'm going to deliver, for to delve any deeper into the story would give too much away. Be prepared, however, for a thought provoking narrative that touches on issues such as scientific ethics, corporate greed, human identity, and compassion.<br/><br/>There are no aliens, lasers/phasers, wormholes, warp engines or jump drives here, just a lonely space age concierge, an unflappable monotone robot, and a whole lot of fodder for your brain to chow down on.<br/><br/>This is what science fiction was meant to be.",
    "\"Absolutely magnificent, Dhoni,finishes off in-style, A magnificent stroke into the crowd! India lift the world cup, After 28 years , The party started in the dressing room. and, Its an Indian captain who's been absolutely magnificent in the night of the final.\" Pretty much one of the best moments of the movie. Massive goosebumps. Ms Dhoni The Untold Story - Is a fantastically made movie which is like two sides of the same coin. The first half which shows why Neeraj Pandey is one of the best directors in the country. While the second half shows why Neeraj Pandey should never make a love story. The movie's main strength is clearly Sushant Singh Rajput who shines in every scene. He has captured the essence of the calm and composed Dhoni and portrayed it brilliantly. The first of the movie is stunning, brilliantly acted, poor special effects with some great dialogues and excellent direction by Neeraj Pandey. The cricketing aspect of Dhoni is so well done. It shows that there is always a team behind a person who is successful. An ode to friendship, struggles, responsibility, compromise and facing life regardless of the unexpected turns and twists. I was in awe how well connected the movie was. Moving from one point to another so effortlessly. Neeraj Pandey's best hour in cinema. The second half starts of well but the two love stories really bring down the movie. The Actresses are likable and all. WTF Neeraj Pandey but the movie moved at a steady pace nevertheless. It was like living the past. The famous India-Pakistan series where Dhoni shines. A lot of moments. It was like a Pleasant flashback. The performances in the movie are brilliant. Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni. What a performance! Not his best, I feel Kai Po Che was better. He was seamless, cool, composed, confident. Just like MSD. He breaks down in one scene. Which was brilliant. The Supporting Star Cast is brilliant.Every Actor in the supporting role. FANTASTIC!!! They are a lot of them. Everyone was brilliant. The actresses were strictly average. The music was decent. The movie is a solid 8-8.5/10. The love angles and the bad special effects in the first half are the only things which could have been improved. You'll love it if you loved cricket. You'll like it if you love good cinema.",
    "This movie is everything I love about movies. It's got great acting, great characters, great story, great dialogue. It's nothing short of amazing. <br/><br/>I haven't seen Farrell in a roll like this before, but he certainly shines. Going from being a brat, to coked up as all hell, to depressed in a matter of minutes and it's hilarious as well as heart breaking.<br/><br/>Gleeson is fantastic in his role too! He plays a perfect mix of cold and calculating, still being sophisticated and also has a conscience of sorts.<br/><br/>Every scene in this movie develops either character or story, and the story unfolds so flawlessly with every passing scene. Going from thinking Ray is just being an arrogant brat to realizing what he has done and why he's acting like he is is a truly fascinating journey, and you can't quite tell whether to laugh or be upset by it, sometimes doing a bit of both at once.<br/><br/>The dialogues and delivery are truly perfect, and it leaves us with so many quotable lines about topics from saving someone you were going to kill from suicide and having a discussion with him about it afterwards to race wars with midgets. Sorry, \"Dwarves\". <br/><br/>The wife telling Harry to bring \"the fellas\" as he leaves and him apologizing for calling her an inanimate object because he was upset brings so much depth to characters and their relationship only from a minute-long scene. True magic with regards to acting and dialogue. This is why dialogue and acting is so important. It brings us closer to the person behind the character and gives the story immensely more depth and excitement.<br/><br/>A cinematic masterpiece!",
    "I teach a college course on WWII, in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. This film comes out on top, perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the Belorussian \"Come and See\" & \"Schindler's List\" are darn close as well).<br/><br/>I had the remarkable experience of watching this film last night with two veterans, one a GI who fought from Omaha to Czechoslovakia. . .and a German infantry officer, a veteran of four years on the Eastern Front. The German, who met Hitler several times, within minutes was exclaiming over the historical accuracy, right down to \"Hitler's\" lower class Munich accent. . .something an American audience would never pick up on. My German friend, who at the end of the war was in East Prussia, in the debacle of attempting to evacuate over a million civilians ahead of the Russians, was profoundly shaken by the film. . .saying the horror, the hospital scenes, the utter chaos, the lynchings, the sight of 12 year old children fighting. . .all of it was real. And an interesting observation by him. . .he had no idea Berlin, at the end, had been as bad as what he witnessed along the Baltic coast and is still haunted by. It truly was \"Gotterdammerung\" for an entire nation and this film brings it frightfully close to you. If you are a parent of small children, the terrifying ending for the Goebbel's children is an absolutely searing nightmare.<br/><br/>I think the most important point of the film was the portrayal of Hitler. . .not as the stereotyped raving madman, usually overplayed like a bad performance of King Richard, but far more subtle. I've talked with many who knew Hitler, including a childhood playmate of Helga, Goebbel's oldest child, and all will tell you that Hitler could be absolutely charming, focused on you, even courtly when with women. The terror is, that even as the actor shows us that \"human\" side, in his soft voice he is dictating orders, observations, and comments of absolute evil. The true form of evil rarely looks evil on the surface, it seduces us with a fair face as it leads, sometimes an entire nation, into damnation. THis film captured that evil.<br/><br/>My German friend's comment at the end of the movie. . .\"I still can not believe we fought for that monster for six years.\" <br/><br/>A history professor at Montreat College",
    "You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",
    "Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of \"otherness\" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. <br/><br/>Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience. <br/><br/>Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",
    "I thought \"The Island\" was fantastic and just was a movie worth watching. Ewan and Scarlett were just great together in this on the seat thriller, the story was just very exciting. Especially since cloning is such a huge debate right now, I know that it is going to get more intense in the future. That's the story's main plot, cloning and wither it's right or wrong of playing God.<br/><br/>The story itself just keeps you guessing and thinking with some very great effects. I would without a doubt recommend \"The Island\" for your viewing pleasure. It's a lot of fun, it's got excitement, romance, action, and a plot that actually worked coming from Michael Bay. :D My only complaint is the ending, which I choose not to give away, but it leaves some room for questioning. Other than that, enjoy! <br/><br/>9/10",
    "This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.<br/><br/>It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. <br/><br/>Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.<br/><br/>We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. <br/><br/>But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.<br/><br/>It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10.",
    "A retired CIA operative, hunted by his own people, reunites his old team for one last mission. It's certainly not an original story, mashing together ideas that we've seen before in the Bourne series, The Expendibles and The Losers. 'RED' (which stands for 'Retired, Extremely Dangerous') is the 4th film this year to be adapted from a graphic novel. It is also the 4th to feature men going on a mission, and the 5th with a plot involving the CIA. I couldn't help but feel skeptical. But then I noticed the cast list and realised that this is meant to be a comedy. At this point I saw the project in a different light. 'RED' is a film in which John McClane, God, Cyrus the Virus and The Queen join forces and kill people for laughs. Clearly this was going to be a film where story and sense came second to cast and chemistry. <br/><br/>From 'Die Hard' to 'Sin City', Bruce Willis' good-guy-having-a-bad-day routine has evolved little, but it does not need to be fixed. His performance in 'RED' is familiar, but he is never less than entertaining. This time he brings with him an air of self-parody. Throughout the film he maintains a carefree poker-face, as though he's done this so many times over the years that he can afford to be relaxed. There are valid attempts at making Willis seem more normal, and these can be quite amusing. The first 10 minutes, which show him adjusting to retirement and aimlessly wandering around the house in his dressing gown, are reminiscent of Carl Fredricksen's first appearance as an old man in 'Up'. Deeper characterisation, however, only serves to show how abnormal he really is, and it is a delight to see him in action.<br/><br/>With the exception of Willis, the cast is made up of actors who have no business waving guns around. Helen Mirren was an inspired choice, as if making up for the predictability of Willis' casting. Flower-arranging OAP on the outside and bad-ass hit-woman on the inside, Mirren is strangely suited to action. There is something about the juxtaposition of her gran-like demeanour with exaggerated violence that makes her very funny and extremely watchable. <br/><br/>John Malkovich is particularly entertaining in his performance as a mentally questionable conspiracy theorist who refuses to retire peacefully. After the numerous roles he has played with an undercurrent of insanity, it is hilarious to see him go full-on howling mad. It is not often that Malkovich gets to flex his comedy muscles, but he steals every scene in which he appears.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is unfortunately the weakest part of this alternative A-Team, not because of his performance but because he is under-utilised. He has little action time and even less characterisation. There is a glimpse at pervy-old-man behaviour (which could have been funny) and a mention of health problems (which could have been touching) but these are quickly forgotten. It is as though the writers were distracted, trying too hard to develop a secondary storyline involving Willis' romance with a pension office clerk. This subplot adds little and distracts from the main picture. It is a pity, because the wasted effort could have been more effectively put into making the story tighter, or on giving Morgan Freeman more screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good laugh, even if you won't remember it afterwards. Taking things less seriously and trying less hard to be cool means that 'RED' is more fun than 'The Expendibles', and less embarrassing too. Stallone can mumble all he wants about \"shooting real action\" - I'd rather see the Queen fire machine guns.",
    "A great story of friendship and survival where an animal escapes from the zoo and his friends go to pick it up but everything goes wrong. The plot and their misadventures are quite original and the whole thing is rendered very well and generates great fun",
    "I just watched this movie last night for the first time. I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.<br/><br/>The movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.<br/><br/>I feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.<br/><br/>If I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it. It's too late now - I can't get it out of my head. I don't think I've ever been affected this much by a movie.",
    "What's interesting to me is the deeper meaning and symbols of the film. The film is really about two women. Sarah, and her friend, Juno. The film opens with Sarah losing both her husband and child in a horrific wreck. Over the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that the accident was caused because the husband was distracted and upset over an affair he was having with Juno. Sarah is aware, at least subconsciously, of Juno's betrayal and that it lead to the deaths of her husband and child. She is not in a place mentally or emotionally to acknowledge it on a conscious level. When Sarah awakens from the wreck, there is a sequence where she runs from darkness. The darkness symbolizes a call to action. Sarah rejects it by running from it. She isn't ready yet. This is classically what chase dreams are about. The dreamer is being pursued by their subconscious given horrible form. If the dreamer can make a conscious effort to stop running and speak to the scary thing chasing them, that dreamer's unconscious will speak directly to the dreamer. This would be the conscious (dreamer) dropping the ego defense (running) and interacting with the subconscious (chaser) to gain new insight.<br/><br/>A year passes and Juno get all the friends together to go spelunking. She lies and takes them to a cave she has discovered because she wants Sarah and her to be the ones who find the cave complex and name it. In Juno's sick mind, she's trying to perform some type of penance. She doesn't see that she's manipulating her friends to do something incredibly dangerous. Juno is a manipulator who only sees things from her own narcissistic point of view. Other people are only as real as Juno feels about them.<br/><br/>Going underground is dream imagery for going into the subconscious. This could be going into a basement under a bar as in Fight Club or even underwater.<br/><br/>Sarah is returning to the darkness that she ran from earlier. She starts to experience hallucinations (waking dreams) mainly her daughter's laugh. Her subconscious is pulling her back to the event that damaged her psyche (the wreck).<br/><br/>They get trapped and so must go deeper into the cave to find a way out. Thus Sarah is going deeper and deeper into her subconscious. It's not readily apparent but it's when they get to the deepest point of the caves (the deepest level of consciousness) that they actually encounter the cave people. If you watch you'll notice that they stop traveling downward (they may fall or are be pushed downward but the never choose to go down). Thus the cave people are the most base and ancient level of Sarah's mind. They lack all their senses. They have no problem-solving or tool-using skills but they are very strong and aggressive. They are a primal force.<br/><br/>While down with these creatures, several key events happen. The first is that Juno and Sarah's friends began to be picked off. The second is Juno's true character is revealed. She stabs one of her friends (accident) but then leaves rather then helps her (because of shock but on purpose). What's interesting is that as soon as Juno reunites with the main group, she makes a big show about she won't leave without Sarah who is missing. She acts differently when people are around. Character is what you do when others aren't watching. Juno is a person of weak character.<br/><br/>The biggest key event is that Sarah is separated from the group and ends up in the den of the cave dwellers. The heart of this lowest level of her subconscious. It is here that Juno's original betrayal becomes fully known to Sarah's conscious self. The friend that Juno stabbed is bleeding to death and tells Sarah of Juno and her husband. It's at this lowest level that Sarah understands Juno. Juno is the type of woman that would wreck the marriage of a good friend, stab a friend and leave them to die alone, and lead all her friends to certain death because of an ego trip. In short, Juno is a destructive force. Sarah kills her hurt friend to end her suffering. This is the action that Juno refused. Sarah empathized with her friend and refused to leave her in pain to make her escape. Juno did not do this. Juno felt that her feelings and safety were more important than her friend's suffering.<br/><br/>The other event that happens in this room, is that Sarah kills a cave dweller child and observes it's mother grieving over the loss. Sarah has now committed the same sin as Juno. The mother tries to kill Sarah. This is what is missing from Sarah's life. Sarah needs to take vengeance on Juno to become whole.<br/><br/>Sarah eventually meets up with Juno again and they began to make their way out as the last two survivors. After the last big fight against the cave dwellers, Sarah confronts Juno about her lies, manipulations, and betrayals. Then, Sarah stabs Juno in the leg and leaves her for the cave dwellers. This the same action Juno took earlier when she stabbed her friend and left her. What is different is that Sarah makes a conscious choice to kill Juno and takes responsibility for the action where Juno avoids the responsibility of everything she has done.<br/><br/>Then there is a long sequence where Sarah is climbing upward out of the dark to the light. This is symbolic of a return to consciousness and the real world.<br/><br/>This movie has parallels with Hamlet. What is missing from Sarah is what was missing from Hamlet. They both need to take action but because of the horribleness of the action they must take, they have recoiled from it and spend the whole story getting to a point where they come to terms with what they must do to be whole.",
    "Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.<br/><br/>Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).<br/><br/>The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.<br/><br/>The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.<br/><br/>What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!",
    "It takes a while for your eyes to get used to the uncanny animation, but once you overcome the ordeal, Beowulf turns into an outrageously entertaining ride. The performances are solid, the visuals are unique, the score is uplifting, and it has great action sequences. It's really good fun for adults of all ages.",
    "You've often heard the sales pitch, \"adults will love it, too!\" almost always referring to a kids' movie and in particularly, an animated movie for children. Well, in this case I agree. Even as a middle-aged adult, I enjoyed this.<br/><br/>The dialog is adult-friendly but at the same time not coarse or crude with no sexual innuendos, no profanity or even a hint of it. Yet, it's hip with some very clever lines.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and offers a few unique twists. David Spade does a fabulous job narrating, has a very pleasing voice, one that's fun to hear. I actually do think adults would like this more than children.",
    "I was very skeptical about this movie from the very beginning, because I thought that this would probably be a dumb monster movie with a similar theme like \"Beauty and the Beast\". However, I was very surprised when I saw the movie and think that it was brilliant!<br/><br/>After reading the reviews on this site, it is my understanding that many people that saw this move completely misunderstood it, both the people that loved it and the ones who hated it. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie is not something similar to Beauty and the Beast for those who might think that! <br/><br/>There are several themes in this movie, but the overall theme is about minorities and how privileged people view those who are different. However to make this message more clear the movie is set in the 1960's, where minorities were generally marginalized. <br/><br/>The lead character Elisa Esposito is a mute woman, who was an orphaned child that was found in a river with wounds on her neck and communicates through sign language. She works in a government laboratory as a cleaning lady. Her friends are her co-worker Zelda, a black woman who serves as an interpreter for Elisa, and her next-door neighbor Giles, a closeted gay man. Elisa discovers a mysterious creature in the facility and begins to bond with it. The creature is a mute humanoid amphibian that was captured in a river in South America by Strickland, who is in charge of the project to study it.<br/><br/>Elisa is the main protagonist in this story, and together with Zelda and Giles, they represent a social minority. Women, handicapped people, black people and gay people are all amongst those that were outcast by society at the time. On the other hand, there is Strickland who is the main antagonist in the story and he represents the privileged people at the time. He is a white man in a privileged position, married with children, religious, and is hostile to those who are not like him. He treats the creature hostilely, beats and abuses it, and calls it a monster.<br/><br/>When Elisa learns that Strickland plans to vivisect the creature, she hatches a plan with the help of her friends to free the creature and keeping it in a bathtub at her apartment and planning to set it free in the ocean. Elisa and the creature bond romantically and it is revealed that the creature has healing powers.<br/><br/>When the day arrives to set the creature free, Strickland arrives and shoots Elisa and the creature. The creature heals itself and kills Strickland. The creature takes Elisa and jumps into the ocean where it heals her. When the creature applies his healing touch to the scars on her neck, she starts to breathe through gills.<br/><br/>Here is the TWIST: This scene reveals that Elisa was of the same kind as the creature all along. She just had a more human like form than the creature. There are different clues throughout the film. She was found as child next to a river like the creature. She was found with the \"scars\" on her neck and they turned out to be dormant gills as the creature healed her. She was mute like the creature. She loved being in water as shown in her morning habits. She was initially attracted to the creature whereas most people would fear it. She comes from a Spanish speaking country, as her last name is Spanish whereas the creature was found in a river in South America.<br/><br/>The creature itself and Elisa represent a minority, as they are alike. The fact that the creature is different yet human like, symbolizes how privileged people viewed minorities at the time. The point of the monster is simply to symbolize how we sometimes view other people that are different from us.<br/><br/>The message of the story is this: You view other people that are different from yourself as \"monsters\" if you don't try to understand them. However, if you try to understand people who are different from yourself, then you will see that we are basically all alike even though we look different.<br/><br/>I think this movie was brilliant and very clever. Guillermo Del Toro did a great job. It is definitely a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>This is my point of view and I hope that you found this helpful.",
    "I saw a sold-out opening night screening of \"Across the Universe\" last night with a group of my friends who had really been looking forward to it. Many of them were extremely disappointed, while in the critical world, Roger Ebert and the New York Times loved it. Because the film was so highly anticipated, and a number of people have asked me how I liked it, I'm writing this review in an attempt to express why the movie is so divisive. I'm not going to talk about plot, or describe any of the numbers. If you're interested in seeing the movie, they'll be more enjoyable if they're unexpected.<br/><br/>It's a bizarre and beautiful movie musical, almost a music video at times, that uses thirty- three of The Beatles' songs and director Julie Taymor's unique visual style to illustrate both a personal love story and the overall conflict in the sixties. The movie is incredibly original and ambitious, and therefore its failings are as dramatic as its successes. Both stem from the same source: Julie Taymor's self-indulgence. That's nothing new to her movies, \"Frida\" and \"Titus\" have the same problem, but in a movie stripped of traditional narrative, it's glaringly obvious. Some songs are impeccably chosen and staged with great creativity, but others are too obvious, or thematically forced so Taymor can cram in another song and stunning visual sequence.<br/><br/>For the first half of the movie, I was frequently divided. One innovative sequence would really pull me into the style, then a forced number or awkward staging would distance me again. When an obvious, recognizable number began, I was torn between a cynical impulse to roll my eyes and an almost exhilarated impulse to laugh and applaud.<br/><br/>\"Across the Universe\" is a mess. There's no denying that. It is poorly paced and badly structured, and at times its feather-light plot and contrived or obligatory numbers become tedious. But at one point, about halfway through, I decided just to go along for the ride. I delighted in every brash, bold choice, whether it worked or not. I let the poignant moments move me, whether or not I intellectually felt that they were contrived.<br/><br/>The Beatles' music had a huge effect on me; from the fateful day that my friend accidentally copied the first three tracks of \"Revolver\" onto my computer, a love affair was born. Their songs are inexorably tied to memories beautiful and horrible scattered all over my life, and as I grow older, I'm constantly discovering new, deeper resonances in their familiar refrains. Even when the context was vague or stretched, the film's reinterpreting and revealing new facets of these songs seemed to serve as a tribute to their breadth and greatness. Taymor's damning depiction of the horrors of war, and lyrical portrait of young, idealistic love are both painfully expressive and unique, and simply took my breath away. By the film's shamelessly corny close, I realized that I had just had a genuine cinematic experience. For all the movies that I watch, that's incredibly rare.<br/><br/>In his review in the New York Times, Stephen Holden writes, \"I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you've tumbled.\" I could laughingly list this movie's flaws from now till next week, but I sort of fell in love with its sheer audacity. You might not. It's extremely naïve, and thematically simple, and you could find that endearing or irritating. You may love it, or you may hate it, but you're going to feel something. This movie will not change your life; don't expect it to. But if you let your criticism fade to the background, and abandon yourself to Taymor's passionate fervor, you may have a pretty amazing experience.",
    "A Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) in the original. Now, that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: Protect John Connor. John Connor(Edward Furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill him;The T-1000(Robert Patrick). Sarah, John, and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day, with a trailing, shape-shifting Termiantor trailing from behind.<br/><br/>This is the greatest of the Terminator trilogy. I have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that Cameron could have improved on. The move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. Schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. He isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. He is a machine. I hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.<br/><br/>The special effects are incredible beyond belief. The shape-shifting T-1000 is some of the greatest animation I have witnessed in cinema history. It absolutely blew my mind when I first experienced this visual extravaganza. The animation looked so real(remembering this was a good ten years). The movie included fast-paced action along with some clever sci-fi drama/horror. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. But the T-1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.<br/><br/>Sci-fi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. This is one of the few exceptions. The prediction of judgment day with Hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of Armageddon. The theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by The Terminator\" It's in your nature to destroy yourselves\". This brings the movie to a whole new level of sci-fi.<br/><br/>Overall, Termiantor II: Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it, buy it! Because once you have seen it, you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "I heard that this movie received negative reviews and feedback, so I was pleasantly surprised when I enJOYed the movie as much as I did.<br/><br/>There is no denying that the grand appeal to the movie was Jennifer Lawrence's compelling performance. The movie's story itself does not seem like it has much to offer. A poor, overworked woman selling a plastic mop does not sound that thrilling on paper. However, Lawrence takes it up a level to a powerful story about a woman never giving up and making her own opportunities happen against all odds. She takes you on an emotional journey from start to finish. Lawrence has the undeniable ability to make you ache along with her struggles. This can be uncomfortable for the helpless movie-goer, which leads me to wonder if this is the reason so many people had distaste for the film. No one wants to be told that hard work and strong will are not enough to succeed in this world, and, as a whole, \"Joy\" does just that. <br/><br/>That being said, \"Joy\" still left me feeling inspired. As a young, aspiration-filled woman myself, Lawrence's portrayal of Joy makes me feel like I can take on the world (which is dream that current American society consistently crushes on the daily). Lawrence's deadpan stares as she struts in and out of offices along with her turning point bathroom haircut, confirm that both Jennifer and Joy are a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>\"Joy\" also possesses a subtle humor, although many reviews seem to deny its existence. The purposefully over the top soap opera scenes obsessed over by bed-bound Terry (played by Virginia Madsen) are just enough to raise the otherwise dark tone. <br/><br/>Lawrence and David O. Russell take you on an emotional journey with \"Joy.\" It may not be the uplifting movie you want this holiday season, but I would argue it is the movie you need.",
    "It's true that you can have too much of a good thing...please no more different editions!<br/><br/>THEATRICAL CUT - was the best version of any of the \"cuts\" it was the most cleanly edited and it had the best soundtrack out of the three. It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.<br/><br/>SUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.<br/><br/>ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don't even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the \"safe room scene\". A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money.",
    "I am 31 so I was 3 when this movie came out. The first time I saw Saturday Night Fever was the \"Edited For Television\" version probably when I was 6 or 7 years old. At that point, it was about the music, the dance scenes and the clothes.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be until years later that I understood what a great story this is. It's a coming of age movie. It's a modern day tragedy. It's a love story.<br/><br/>The first thing that people think about when they hear Saturday Night Fever is disco and bell bottoms, but the story is timeless. Travolta plays Tony Manero, a loser in a nowhere job who only feels alive when he is on the dance floor at the local disco. There he is adored by his friends, by women and by strangers. There he is king. Everywhere else he is nobody. Even at home.<br/><br/>Tony becomes infatuated with a woman named Stephanie. On the surface Stephanie appears to be much better off than Tony. For the most part Stephanie is a big talker, but Tony is bothered by her observations.<br/><br/>\"Let me guess. You work all week long at some dead end job and then you go and blow it at all at 2001 (the disco) on the weekends. You're a cliché. You're no one, going nowhere.\" As much as Tony is upset by her words he can't argue with them. Soon Tony becomes frustrated with his \"station in life\" and tells Stephanie he wants out (of Brooklyn).<br/><br/>What makes Saturday Night Fever work so much for me is Tony is very typical of a lot of males who would rather have a good time and party now than build something toward the future. Bars are full of guys like Tony. Guys who are super stars in their local drinking establishments, but have no life outside of the night life.<br/><br/>And of course there's the superb dance scenes that most people remember Saturday Night Fever for. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, Saturday Night Fever also has my favorite closing shot of all time. It's really nothing special, but I get choked up every time I see it.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is also a snapshot of a period in recent American history. The movie took place in 1977. The country was a mess after the Vitenam war ended and before Reagan stormed Washington and once again instilled a sense of pride in Americans. There was no longer a war to protest, but the average American didn't have much faith in our country. I think Saturday Night Fever does an excellent job of capturing what was probably a common attitude among young adults during the late 70's. Live for the moment because the future is pretty bleak.",
    "For those who don't like documentaries (the documentary about Snowden, which is part of this movie, is excellent education about what our government can do with us) watch this first. Oliver Stone paints a portrait of a stand-up, pretty much button down guy who realizes the work he falls into is anything but what he was taught was right -- and then he needs to find a way out, without endangering his girlfriend. Another great film about a whistleblower --- and for his whistleblowing, he faces far harsher penalties just for coming home. Oliver Stone delivers thought provoking film again, and the entire cast, as well as the writing, is stellar.<br/><br/>For those who made up their mind about Ed Snowden through what was reported in mass media, I would simply say, watch this with an open mind. What happened to him could happen to any of us. This is a cautionary tale based on true facts told in the most exquisite way by Stone and his cast.<br/><br/>Isabeau Vollhardt, author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey",
    "I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.<br/><br/>At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.<br/><br/>There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",
    "***SPOILER ALERT - I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS MOVIE! ***<br/><br/>It's a shame that this film was promoted as a \"hot\" erotic thriller. Kubrick would not have allowed that marketing campaign to go forward had he been alive.  Sure there's a lot of eroticism in this movie, but those who go to it looking for sexual thrills are going to be (and were) sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>The events in this movie are triggered by the protagonist's wife's revelation that she almost slept with another man.  This kicks off a range of emotions and prompts him to re-evaluate his sexual relationship with her, subsequently leading to a trip through his sexual SUBconscious.  This is the critical point that all too many viewers miss, though it's so overtly surreal I don't see how one could miss it.  None of this is real!  It's called Eyes Wide SHUT for a reason!<br/><br/>All of our protagonists' \"encounters\" represent manifestations of his sexual fantasies and fears.  His fantasies include group sex, sex with a teenager, sex with a prostitute, sex without strings.  His fears include disease, homosexuality (notice the brutal and brief encounter with the gay-bashing gang), and most of all: discovery.  Discovery of his hidden fantasies, which might reveal his true nature to the world.  Discovery that he is really a pretender, doesn't really belong, and is not worthy after all.  This latter is probably universal, and in his case while it has sexual dimensions it is not purely sexual.  In the end he realizes that his fantasies are just fantasies, at least some of his fears are legitimate, and that instead of just fantasizing about sex he should actually have sex with his wife.  Not rocket science here, but plenty of people need reminding of this from time to time, and it's a well-told story.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to first see this movie in theaters overseas, and was spared the atrocity of digital editing to make things less explicit. David Lynch did the same thing more recently in Mulholland Drive, and I hope that this is not the beginning of a trend.  Given all of the explicit gore and brutality in movies, the level of sexual explicitness that triggers the censors is simply laughable.  Frankly, having seen the un-edited version, I didn't think it was a big deal.<br/><br/>One can't dismiss criticisms that the nudity was all female and many of the women were depicted as sexual objects, but this movie is quite pointedly a trip through a fairly conventional man's sexual unconscious and necessarily told from a male point of view.  So none of these things should be a surprise.  It would be very interesting to see a comparable exploration of the female sexual subconscious by an accomplished woman director, though I'm not holding my breath that the Hollywood establishment will allow that to happen soon.",
    "I had no idea what was going on most of the time because I'm not particularly familiar with Warcraft's story. That being said, this is a decent movie, especially considering it's a video game franchise film...90% of the time video game films are very badly adapted to the screen.",
    "Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)<br/><br/>It was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn't end there however...<br/><br/>This film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali's face, and Zahra's tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.<br/><br/>We see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali's Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.<br/><br/>There is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.<br/><br/>Later in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.<br/><br/>The film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour.  This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.<br/><br/>The film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.<br/><br/>Missing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.<br/><br/>I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Ollie",
    "Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.<br/><br/>What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (on scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation who is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The set up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it is involving, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action so much more effective, as we are so invested in the characters, for all their all too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge for its entirety, and doesn't cop out at the end either.<br/><br/>The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles, when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on-screen power these days). This film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and the quality of the film. It just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt, it ends up going straight to video. I wish I'd got the chance to see this on the big screen.",
    "I must say, no signs of aging. Embedded in its day and yet totally relevant. Perhaps the most entertaining of all of Hitchcock's films. Marriage is the theme and murder is the hook. James Stewart is as perfect as he's ever been. He uses the contradictions of his character to create someone immediately familiar. Thelma Ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. Grace Kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream. She remains a sort of dream that's why to see her climb the killer's balcony is one of my most cherished film memories. If you haven't seen the film you may think I'm rambling but if you have, you know exactly what I mean, don't you?",
    "Pier Paolo Pasolini, as is well known, was murdered not long after he finished work on this, his most audacious and confrontational film, yet even the most casual viewing of SALO begs the question - had he not been murdered, would he have taken his own life anyway? Every sequence, every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair, barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race, one gets the impression that Pasolini was barely hanging onto life - and any attendant shreds of hope - by his fingernails. Although ostensibly an adaptation of one of DeSade's most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the Second World War with the Fascist ruling classes as its (authentically vile) villains, SALO also contains a lot of contemporary criticism - Pasolini hated the modern world, and explained the stomach-churning 'banquet of s**t' as a none-too-subtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains. (The scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society - those who come to SALO expecting titillation or B-movie sleaze will be sorely disappointed.) Beyond the nihilistic content, which has been well documented elsewhere, the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washed-out, faded film stock using primarily static cameras, long shots, choppy editing and very few cutaways, SALO has a visual style reminiscent of cinema-verite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music, piano dirges and the (intentionally?) scrappy post-dubbed dialogue, and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. SALO comes across as one long primal scream of rage, designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency, and in this respect, the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once, or indeed for 'entertainment', is another matter, but SALO is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it.",
    "I had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.<br/><br/>I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.",
    "There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic that will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers, just like its predecessors by Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott. Despite the many questions I had in my mind when I left the theater and the moments during the film when I felt disappointed or confused, I knew this, and I have not stopped thinking about the movie and longing to be back in front of the screen.<br/><br/>It is easy to criticize this movie as some have done for being overly ambitious, pandering to low taste, being too simple or too complex, with too few actors or too many, or even for celebrating revenge violence against professional critics who write negative reviews. They may all be correct, but these critics will still put themselves in the same category as those that warned audiences against 2001 or Blade Runner. The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach, its visual and acoustic impact, its mesmerizing flow and its completely ground-breaking storytelling, and movie goers will see it and feel it in their guts. <br/><br/>It is a movie that is a product of our age of internet-driven universal knowledge and vision, and the freedom we have to travel the world and jump between ages, genres, images and identities at our will. It reminds us that we are human and that we can still hear our heart beat, if we listen.",
    "Some reviewers have suggested that the storyline of this movie is a bit plodding and portentous, and I'd be willing to allow that. But even if this film had absolutely no plot to speak of, I would have considered the money I plunked down yesterday to see \"Hero\" to be money well-spent, because I have been witness to some of the most achingly beautiful film-making I've ever seen. As in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but \"Crouching Tiger\" surely could have benefited from the sublime camera eye of \"Hero.\" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality. At a time when movie theaters show a lot of utter dreck, we ought to be supporting movies like this.",
    "Anyone who knows me knows my favorite band is The Beach Boys, and my favorite musician is their leader, Brian Wilson. I first got deep into their music last November when I heard their album SMiLE, an album which wasn't officially released until 45 years after its conception and recording. It was worth the wait, as I consider it the best album I've ever heard.<br/><br/>I found out that a biopic of Wilson was in the works, and would be screening at SXSW with Wilson in attendance. I knew I had to go and see this film. The experience is one that will stick with me for the rest of my life as one of the most emotionally powerful events I have been a part of.<br/><br/>Love and Mercy is the story of The Beach Boys' founder Brian Wilson. The film chronicles his rise to fame in the 1960's and the his decline into mental illness, and his escape from the control of his therapist in the 1980's.<br/><br/>Paul Dano plays Wilson in the 1960's, and John Cusack plays him in the 1980's. It also stars Elizabeth Banks as Wilson's future wife, Melinda Ledbetter, and Paul Giamatti as his therapist, Eugene Landy.<br/><br/>Paul Dano exudes the boyish look of young Wilson perfectly. He relearned how to play piano for the role, and sings much of the music in the film.<br/><br/>His performance is hard to watch at times because of how depressing it is seeing him devolve from an energetic, fun young man into a tortured, drained artist. Dano handles the role with passion and care, and his performance never feels forced or fake.<br/><br/>When Wilson begins to suffer a panic attack, anyone who's had one will feel deeply for him. When he starts to have physical symptoms of depression after years of physical and mental abuse from his father and disapproval of his musical direction from fellow band mate Mike Love, Dano portrays the hurt that comes from those events with subtle facial expressions and natural transition.<br/><br/>John Cusack looks less like Wilson physically, but his performance may be even more complex. His Wilson has been to the bottom, and he brilliantly portrays how challenging it is to rebuild your life after going through mental and physical anguish.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Banks has a great departure from her more well known comedic film roles, and as Ledbetter, she shows her strength and respect for the man she loves through actions and subtle expressions instead of overt, over the top dialog.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti has the most campy role in the film as Eugene Landy, but this is unfortunately how Landy was in real life. He was as violent and controlling over Wilson's life as the movie portrays, so his abusive, manipulative, angering performance is highly accurate.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Love and Mercy is that it doesn't exaggerate or make up events to make the film more interesting. The filmmakers trust the strength of its source material is interesting enough to make for a great story.<br/><br/>The storytelling structure of the movie is interesting and risky. The film jumps from the 60's to the 80's without warning, and it works. The slightly askew technique allows the audience to experience the downfall and uprising of Wilson's life simultaneously, and allows the movie to end on a happy note.<br/><br/>One complaint people have is that the film skips over the 1970's, Wilson's most tumultuous period in which he weighed 300 pounds and spent the majority of three years in bed, crippled by depression and drug addiction. However, this allows the audience to examine the reasons for his downfall and redemption instead of indulging in the horrible escapism Wilson turned to.<br/><br/>Beach Boys fans will appreciate the movie more than the average film-goer. Mike Love in hats, dancing, and mentioning \"the formula\"? Check. Drug tent and piano in the sandbox in Wilson's living room? Check. The infamous \"Fire\" session? Check. Everything is on point, from the scarily accurate wardrobe down to recreating the \"Sloop John B.\" and \"Surf's Up\" promo videos shot for shot. It's these moments that show the film was made by fans with an attention for detail.<br/><br/>Almost every song on the album Pet Sounds is featured in the film somewhere. Seeing Wilson's unorthodox recording techniques is such a pleasure for music nerds.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Robert Yeoman, best known for creating the look of Wes Anderson's films, blends stylistic tone with realistic camera work, creating a sense of false nostalgia that is surreal yet inviting and intense.<br/><br/>Composer Atticus Ross works wonders with the score, using a great wealth of Wilson's music in different ways and choosing songs that fit with the emotional tone of the scene brilliantly. Hearing the instrumental version of \"Don't Talk\" play as Wilson takes LSD for the first time is haunting. Witnessing the song \"Til' I Die\" play over a surreal, Kubrickian scene in which Wilson has an epiphany made me cry because of the powerful combination of imagery and music.<br/><br/>The film is being released on June 5, to capitalize on The Beach Boys music being a staple of the summer, but it feels more like a Thanksgiving release to me. The cinematography, acting, script, and score are all Oscar worthy in my opinion, but the film may get lost in the race to other contenders, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Love and Mercy is an awesome, unorthodox biopic that takes risks with form and narrative that has strong performances, script, cinematography, and of course, an amazing soundtrack. It will expose young people to the brilliance of Wilson's music and give older fans an insight into why Wilson is the poster boy for using creativity as an escape and an outlet from the pain of life and mental illness.<br/><br/>And seriously, listen to the album SMiLE.",
    "If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.",
    "With workers striking in Russia, the crew of the battleship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me  surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.<br/><br/>The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the media but also a cracking good film in its own right.",
    "Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.<br/><br/>Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to \"Christmas Town\". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.<br/><br/>People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! <br/><br/>10/10",
    "The internet is a funny place... it seems to be filled with people who have graduated with 5 Ph.Ds. and clearly seem to be smarter than everybody else (thousands of astronauts and astrophysicists on IMDb apparently). One star rating? Come on... Clearly, you haven't watched enough films to know decent from terrible.<br/><br/>I watched this film without having heard of it (no trailers, spoilers or anything). I'm a sci-fi fan and thought this was a good watch.<br/><br/>I found the characters to lack depth and their actions were questionable at times but the plot was believable and the acting decent. Special effects were good and made the movie believable in my opinion. The movie was well shot and I thought the scenes with the creature were pretty cool.<br/><br/>I don't get how people even compare this movie to \"Aliens\"; it's nothing alike. Overall, I thought it was pretty good.",
    "The cultural references of Wayne's World may date it a bit, but the nature and personality of its humor set it apart. There is a kind of naive benevolence and boundless joy which makes this movie so lovable. Its aimless plot and exaggerated humor are cute, without ever transcending that barrier into maudlin sentiment. This is a difficult mix to achieve, especially when so many comedians go out of their way to achieve \"street credibility\" through as much forced vulgarity and stereotypical humor as possible. Campbell and Carvey's characters were the ultimate comedic anti-heroes for generation X, even more so than Jay and Silent Bob, Bill and Ted, or Beavis and Butthead. They championed amateurism, paraded self-affecting humor, and became worshiped for telling everyone they weren't worthy. If '60s pop culture encouraged people to \"do your own thing,\" Wayne and Garth were the genuine article in the '90s. Two complete geeks had fun acting as themselves, and became celebrated in the process. One of the true comedy classics of our time. 8.5/10",
    "Let me confess I'm not a Catholic, I don't have children, I can't stand schmaltz and yet I love The Sound Of Music. I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: \"It makes you feel alive\" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you.",
    "I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, i was simply compelled to watch it until the end. I already knew how it ended so i was surprised it commanded my attention so intensely.<br/><br/>The fact is the characters were all so realistically portrayed and the film was so expertly directed that it was almost as if the Apollo 13 disaster was filmed and that is what i was watching.<br/><br/>Now this film is certainly not to everyone's taste, it is quite slow in the build up and the film relies almost entirely on the script and ability of the cast.<br/><br/>If you like your disaster films loud and in your face then this is probably not for you, but if you like them realistic (slightly dramatised) then watch it and be astounded.<br/><br/>9/10",
    "A true best of both worlds for classic Disney and classic Pixar fans. It had already been many years since the acquisition, but for me this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar doing Disney.",
    "Much as I admire Spike Lee's talent and audacity, this film just didn't work for me. Too many preposterous plot points while the motivations (of everyone, it seemed) were never clear. The whole thing was just confusing.<br/><br/>And yes, disjointed.",
    "Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger has experienced both. On January 15, 2009, Sully made the decision to land the crippled aircraft of US Airways flight 1549 right into a river  an event immediately labeled \"Miracle on the Hudson\".<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this is the first film collaboration for Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood. Both have cinematic experience with true life stories and real people: Hanks most recently in Captain Phillips and Bridge of Spies; and Clint with American Sniper and J. Edgar. This one is the perfect fit as Hanks takes on a good man who takes pride in doing his job, and Clint brings to life a story that showcases the best of human nature.<br/><br/>Tom Komanicki adapted the screenplay from the book \"Highest Duty\", co-written by Sully and Jeffrey Zaslow. Much of the attention is given to the doubts and uncertainty Sully experienced during the NTSB review. The scrutiny of his work by the committee (played here by the ultra-serious Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan) left his career and reputation dangling, inspiring nightmares that are much worse than yours and mine.<br/><br/>Certainly we are in awe of what Sully pulled off that morning, but as movie goers, we are anxious to see the plane crash/splash/landing. Clint comes through in breath-taking fashion. While it lacks the hysterics and drama of the upside-down plane in Flight, this re-creation is so realistic that we nearly obey the flight attendants repeated instructions of \"Heads down. Stay down\". Even the cockpit chatter, passenger evacuation, and first responder's (many of whom are real life folks, not actors) activities are played in matter-of-fact manner  more people just doing their job. We shiver knowing the icy Hudson River water is 36 degrees, and we feel Sully's anxiety as he desperately tries to get a final count  a count that he prays will hit 155.<br/><br/>Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles and has a couple of memorable scenes, and Laura Linney embraces the thankless role of telephone wife of Sully during the aftermath and hearings. We get a glimpse of Sully's background with flashbacks to his flight lessons at a Denison Texas private airfield, as well as a portion of his military service. Hanks is the perfect choice for a role that would have suited James Stewart just fine if it were the 1940's.<br/><br/>The conflict here comes from the NTSB inquiry. Backed by computer simulators that show the plane could have coasted back to LaGuardia, we get the distinct feeling that the committee's goal is finding human error – naming a scapegoat (other than Canadian geese) for their \"lost\" plane. It's Sully who reminds us that the committee is simply doing their job  just as he was, Skiles was, the Flight Attendants were, and the first responders were.<br/><br/>This is technically expert filmmaking. We know the ending, but are glued to the screen. Frequent Eastwood collaborator Tom Stern handles the cinematography, and like the acting and story-telling, the camera work avoids any excess or over-dramatization. The film provides one of the best examples ever of the duality of hero worship and intense scrutiny, and how a person can be a hero by simply doing their job. The closing credits show clips of the flight's reunion and every survivor would agree that the best among us allowed a continuation of life  something that could have gone to the other extreme.",
    "It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan's \"worst\" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. <br/><br/>Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the aestetics of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the \"comic book\" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me. <br/><br/>As for the score, I am more than willing to argue that this is, hands down, James Newton Howard's best score of his very successful career. It is compelling and booming. It's very powerful, but not over-the-top and excessive. For anyone with the soundtrack, check out 'The Orange Man' and 'Visions'. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. And I stress the word \"powerful\". Yeah, he's no Hermann or Morricone, but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling. <br/><br/>The writing and the direction are just as captivating as the score. Almost every line of dialogue and every scene seems to be placed out on an island, alone so that everyone can stop and judge it. Some people might view this as cocky and/or boring direction, but I see it as daring and unique. Much of Shyamalan's writing is done that way. ('…I see dead people…' '...They call me Mr. Glass…' etc. etc.) Another aspect of the film that tickles my fancy is the underlying themes. I do believe, to a certain extent, that people do have somewhat supernatural powers at times. People have been known to make miracles and do unbelievable things. Maybe these things could be 'developed' in some way. These theories are, in a way, intertwined with some aspects of psychology, such as selective attention and self-actualization. If you care to discuss some of these ideas, let me know and I will relate them to the film through my eyes. In short, I do believe there is a superhero in everyone. It may not be through supernatural powers, but it may simply be through the act of reaching out to a person in need. Other themes of the movie, like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing, yet universal. From a psychological point of view, Shyamalan really gets inside the head of OI patients (osteogenesis imperfecta). He then brings this psyche to the next level with Jackson's character. Elijah, is very passionate but very tortured and evil. His interactions with Willis bring depth and focus to both the characters and the story. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. The shots of Willis in his security poncho. The train station scene. Elijah's breathtaking fall on the stairs and many more speak so loudly to me and say so much in just a simple clip. For some reason this movie just speaks to me, like art. If anyone cares to discuss more about this film, that'd be cool. There is a lotta other cool stuff to talk about with this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it a few more times. It may not be the feel good film of the year, or the masterpiece that everyone was looking for, but it definitely sits well with me.",
    "Well, if I could split the movie into two, I would say that the first half is a superb Proposal and the second half is fairly traditional Hollywood pablum. In the first half, the wonderful comedic timing and chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds was terrific. The writing was first-rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put-downs. Kudos to the Director, Anne Fletcher, and the Screenwriter, Pete Chiarelli.<br/><br/>The completely different tone in the second half, I surmise, could only be attributed to the studios/producers stepping in and stating that the film must appeal to a wider audience. We, then, get lots of family characters thrown in, with a great reduction of Bullock and Reynolds mutual screen time. And when they do share time in the second half, it's more about slapstick/physical humor (cue studios/producers needing appeal to wider, a.k.a, younger audience). Maudlin music comes in on the soundtrack, letting us know that this part of the movie is supposed to tug on our heartstrings.<br/><br/>I don't buy the inevitable resolution either. I don't believe that it is supported well or justified by what came before it.<br/><br/>The 1st 45 minutes is WELL worth seeing. I wish the filmmakers could have pushed and maintained the pace and feel for the entire movie. Reynolds and Bullock are so good, they could be this generation's Tracy and Hepburn. I'd like to see them in another project that follows through all the way.<br/><br/>BTW, this film was actually shot in Boston and (the Alaska scenes) in Manchester by the Sea and Rockport on the North Shore with digital effects adding snow capped mountains. You might even recognize Motif No.1, a famous small building on a wharf in Rockport which has been the subject of many famous painters' and photographers' work. It was also fun seeing some of my local Boston area acting colleagues doing background work in the film.",
    "I was supposed to be be seeing either Flight or Argo today, but to my disappointment I missed both showtimes, and I was in a tight time frame where I could see anything. So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how \"pretty\" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. <br/><br/>Overall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it. Highly recommended.",
    "What unlikely trio to fall in love with, just as unlikely as the landscape. When a movie fits so well without a tag that links it to anything else in its historic film context, it can only be described as a happy accident. Premeditated for sure, but accident nonetheless. Terence Stamp, is an actor with a spectacular career. Varied and surprising. It defies description, but let me try. Peter Ustinov's \"Billy Budd\" William Wyler's \"The Collector\" Federico Fellini's \"Spirit of the Dead\" John Schlesinger's \"Far From The Madding Crowd\" Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"Teorema\" Joseph Losey's \"Modesty Blaise\" Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\" Stephen Frear's \"The Hit\" Richard Donner's \"Superman\" \"Steven Sodebergh's \"The Limey\" Am I making my point? He is an actor for all seasons, beautiful beyond belief to boot. In \"The Adventures of Pricilla Queen of The Desert\" he unveils another unexpected side to his considerable talents. A Woman. And what a woman, a Meryl Streep with a past and, thanks to director Stephan Elliot, with a future. Dressed by geniuses. More human than ever. He is flanked by two spectacular Aussies. Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) giving a performance of such tenderness that even my brother in law, a homophobic macho man of the first order,loved him. And Guy Pearce (L A Confidential) He is such a beautiful,sexy, funny girl that made me long for a her/he all to myself. Some other monstrously cloned movies were rushed into production trying to capitalize on the success of Pricilla. They all failed miserably and rightly so. Frank Capra, accepting his AFI Lifetime Achievement Award sent a profound and heartfelt advise to young filmmakers. \"Don't follow trends, start new ones\" Well done Mr Elliot. Well done.",
    "The movie, \"Se7en\", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.<br/><br/>The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from \"The Divine Comedy\", sets out to, \"preach\" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.<br/><br/>Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.<br/><br/>Score 10/10",
    "Army of Darkness (1992) is in my opinion by far the best one of the \"Evil Dead\" trilogy! It is my second favorite film of the trilogy, I just love, love this movie to death!!!! It is my personal favorite horror movie in the Evil Dead series. The best one is the theatrical cut the rest versions are pure crap with lameness. The original cut kicks ass!!! Great movie! This movie is so silly, that it's actually funny. <br/><br/>I have always loved Army of Darkness and I always will. I love this film to death!!!! I was watching with my dad this film and even he loved it. So yes I proud to say I love this film and I have enjoyed More than the original The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987)! This film has funny moments, balance, smart genius creativity, great babes, mystic forces and mystic knights in it.<br/><br/>Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun. <br/><br/>Army of the dead who were actually skeletons were fabulous, the fights were awesome and they and they were highly enjoyable. The film was fast paced from the beginning till the end. I am sorry if you guys love Evil Dead 2 much better than this film, I just love Army of Darkness much better, this film is just a great worthy sequel to their predecessors. Ash is like ably hero on screen and he is one of the most popular hero's till it's days. Army of Darkness is a classic. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, & the special effects masters KNB! You cant ask for more. Great story, funny lines, fantastic looking monsters. I don't care what anyone says I just love this film to death!!! <br/><br/>What we get in here is a hybrid of sorts with Bruce Campbell once again as Ash the reluctant hero fighting ghouls and goblins (well maybe not goblins) in the medieval times. This third chapter goes for more of the laughs rather then the scares and actually offers up a fun take on the genre mix director Sam Raimi tells. The movie is not as annoying as the previous 2 films and closes out the trilogy nicely. They are a lot of talks of an Army of Darkness 2 and I don't want any sequel to this horror/comedy flick. I thought this film closed the trilogy beautiful. There is a lots of comic relief, over the top cuts, BOOMSTICK!!!!! <br/><br/>Army of Darkness is my second favorite movie (Evil Dead II, Dark Knight, ARMY OF DARKNESS) and here's why. It follows the character of Ashley (Ash) J. Williams in his journey to the past that is far better explained in Evil Dead II. He is only able to be sent back to his own time (and his job at S Mart) if he finds the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) which will also free the people who can help him from the attacks of the deadites. Ash has to find the book, get the babe, fight some demons, and get back home...like in the deal. This movie has it all, and some sugar, baby! It is a hilarious, gory, wonderful display of Bruce Campbell's ingenious acting ability, and anyone who says differently is a deadite. It's a film that would make Clive Barker proud. An oddball yet absolutely successful pairing of slapstick Comedy and undead Horror with a medieval setting thrown into the mix for good measure, 1992's Army of Darkness sits proudly near the top of the list of most unconventional yet absolutely entertaining motion pictures in history. Following up on 1981's oft-banned The Evil Dead and 1987's The Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (itself a Horror-Comedy hybrid), Army of Darkness represents the most accessible and audience-friendly of the three. Special effects; gore; humor; and of course, Bruce Campbell's over-the-top antics are Awesome!!! Hail to the king, baby.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is a 1992 American dark fantasy action comedy film directed by Sam Raimi. It is the third installment of the Evil Dead franchise. The film was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell (also acting as co-producer) and Embeth Davidtz. Continuing from Evil Dead II, Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.<br/><br/>Beyond in human flesh, inked in blood-and amazingly hard to pronounce-the ancient \"Necronomicon\" (Book of the Dead) unleashes unspeakable evil upon mankind in director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic. Back to do battle with the hideous \"Deadites,\" Bruce Campbell reprises his role from the Evil Dead series as Ash, the handsome, shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk from S-Mart's housewares division. Demonic forces time warp him-and his '73 Oldsmobile-into England's Dark Ages, where he romances a beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and faces legions of undead beasts, including a ghastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the dead, rescue his girlfriend and get back to his own time? This movie is personal second favorite movie it is 10/10.",
    "Going into the theater, I was under the impression that this was a silly James Franco and Seth Rogen movie that made fun of The Room, a legendary bad movie. That's not what the Disaster Artist is at all. Instead, it celebrates The Room. It celebrates Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, their passion, and their pursuit of a dream. <br/><br/> Sure, The Disaster Artist comments on how The Room bombed terribly; it had to acknowledge this. It comments on the utter lack of acting talent that Tommy and Greg possessed; it had to acknowledge this too. But it handles these details with such delicacy and care that I never felt that it was putting down the characters. Actually, it seemed that the film admired them. Even when the world told them to quit, they never gave up on themselves or each other. The message is surprisingly inspiring. <br/><br/> The movie becomes something more than mere mockery because of the way it handles the relationship between Tommy and Greg with such care and affection. The two genuinely liked each other and saw each other in ways that no one else did. Greg certainly did not understand all of Tommy's methods and decisions, but he understood Tommy's good intentions. Establishing this buddy connection is crucial later in the movie. <br/><br/>After Tommy writes The Room and they begin filming, Tommy expresses his idiosyncrasies in full force. While the film crew sees him as a confusing weirdo, we know there's something more. Despite his utter incompetence in directing and acting and all aspects of filmmaking, we still root him. And we still root for Greg, ever the supportive friend. Tommy makes absurd and confounding choices that don't make sense to Greg and they don't make sense to anyone else either. Even one of Tommy's explanations was simply \"people do crazy things.\" Still, Greg remains loyal. <br/><br/>With as strange as Wiseau behaves, capturing his eccentricities would clearly prove challenging. Give James Franco credit for capturing Wiseau's weirdness in character without ever devolving into derisive mockery. Franco captures his gait, stiff shoulders, hunched posture, indeterminable and inconsistent accent, and his laugh. Watching The Room and hearing Tommy Wiseau laugh, I thought that it sounded completely fake. I chalked it up to another instance of poor acting. But after seeing Wiseau in interviews, I realized that it was his real laugh. To him, the laugh wasn't poor acting because that's what he thinks a genuine laugh sounds like. <br/><br/> Seeing and hearing Wiseau behaving as himself explains a lot about his behavior in The Room. He's just an interesting and very unusual guy. His acting and the acting of others in his movie is still atrocious, but it shifts from startlingly and confusingly bad to understandably bad. And more importantly, seeing the real Tommy makes his movie all the more fun. <br/><br/> You don't need to see The Room to enjoy The Disaster Artist. Would it help? Sure. Seeing The Room first makes many of the inside jokes made in The Disaster Artist funnier and gives a clearer sense of how confoundingly weird the movie truly is. Words cannot do it justice. To understand, you have to see The Room for yourself. I recommend seeing both.",
    "This film is an insult to Faith Sultan Mehmet, to Ottoman history, and to the intelligence of any audience. It is the very example of how western orientalizm can be internalized. The reason why the conquest of Constantinopolis was a matter of survival for the Turks -the economical, political reasons- were totally non existent. Mehmet II, a well educated man, is nothing more than a religious zealot in this film. Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, who is well respected by the Turks, is a caricature. <br/><br/>Suicide bombings, only a phenomenon of late 20th century, is a common theme in the film: all Ottoman soldiers behave like suicide bombers! What is this? What are they trying to imply? This is a part of the recent series of superficial films and TV shows which seem to aim de-educating Turkey, constantly attack reason, and play at Turkish people's feelings of being under attack of western contempt, orientalizm and memories of WWI defeat.<br/><br/>The side themes fail as hard as the main theme: an absurd love story, a wife with no dialogue, unexplainable motives of Urban, and so on... <br/><br/>This film is harshly criticized in Turkey. I can't imagine why it is being defended so eagerly on IMDb. Because it fails in stirring any feeling of satisfaction of national pride as well. No character study, no context, no wit, not even a propaganda, just the first depiction of the conquest with a relatively big production, a way to imagine how it was, and that's why people go to see this movie in masses. One can't deny the production of war scenes is an improvement for Turkish film industry, but unfortunately, that's all.",
    "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy's dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit & charm along with Indy's usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.<br/><br/>This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg's output: A young Indiana \"beginning\" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat \"You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it.\" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. <br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There's a bit of kissing/banter, and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. There's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy's Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it's up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
    "I attended the Cast and Crew screening on Sunday, in Leicester Square, with high hopes for this film as it's without doubt the most exciting job I've had. This was my first feature experience, and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.<br/><br/>But, even as someone with a lot of time for his films, and a pre-existing bias, I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free-floating, evocative trip. Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.<br/><br/>With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his \"Tideland\" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem, that Tim Burton, while he is still making decent films, has been a long way off special for some time now.<br/><br/>6/10 (if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5), but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids, I'm sure it'll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved, and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film (although I got this one for free...)",
    "I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.<br/><br/>I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created. The Return of the King was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!",
    "What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! <br/><br/>I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.<br/><br/>Back to the Future (1985) <br/><br/>From the Academy Award \"- winning team of Steven Spielberg\" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.<br/><br/>At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car \"DeLorean\". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.<br/><br/>After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.<br/><br/>What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.<br/><br/>They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.<br/><br/>More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost \"chewed every scenes\" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs \"The Power of Love,\" and \"Earth Angel\".<br/><br/>The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as \" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! \"",
    "***May contain Spoilers***<br/><br/>I was embarrassed as an American seeing this film. Just knowing that it would be seen over seas. It's amazing how a submarine can withstand 40 depth charges while another could be put out by two. And I believe it would also be a virtual impossibility for Americans to commandeer a German sub and vice versa.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this movie is its arrogant rewriting of history. It was the British who first captured the enigma machine NOT the Americans. We have no right to take credit for other nations accomplishments. Hollywood simply has a historical ignorance. But beyond that it is still just an awful, awful movie. No one with half a brain would be entertained by this garbage.",
    "This film isn't for all people. That's to say about a lot of movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs?<br/><br/>First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of \"time slowdowns\" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads traveling in slow-motion across the screen... it's all there. <br/><br/>The story on the other hand isn't very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.<br/><br/>Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly cliché phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. \"I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honor then live in shame!\" Sounds familiar? <br/><br/>Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.<br/><br/>Now that's fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.<br/><br/>I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.<br/><br/>So here's the deal.<br/><br/>If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes, wonderful camera-work and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You'll be missing out if you don't. There is so much to see, so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It'll leave you in awe.<br/><br/>However, you are looking for a good story, clever plot twists, some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this, nor does it wants to give you this. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie so much, but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish, and that's understandable. Just be sure to make up your mind about what you want to see when you go to the theater yourself instead of being drawn into bias by the tons of reviews this site has to offer.",
    "The early 90s version of an action movie - non stop gunfire and fights. One very good reason to watch this series is that any movie after this seems to be excellent. The only saving grace are some really old wisecracks from Jason Statham. Skip it, if you need to.",
    "The assassination of JFK has been told in every possible way through every available medium. Oliver Stone managed the unimaginable transforming and almost folk tragedy, through a mix of drama and cinema veritè, into a riveting mystery thriller with the paranoiac style of a man who's in touch with paranoia in a quasi permanent basis. Unnerving, frustrating and spectacularly satisfying. Kevin Costner manages to be convincing as the center piece of the conspiracy theory. We believe the whole damn thing because we see it through his logic. Sissy Spacek, as his wife, represents most us and she does it brilliantly. Tommy Lee Jones and Kevin Bacon are a pleasure to watch. Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and even John Candy, Sally Kirkland and Vincent D'Onofrio deliver little parts of the puzzle without ever becoming distracting. Gary Oldman is a chilling dead ringer for Lee Harvey Oswald. For film lovers, for history nuts, for pop culture fanatics and for conspiracy theorists, this is a must.",
    "Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.<br/><br/>Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!",
    "In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.",
    "I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can't get aboard the hype train. It's really the same as every other cartoonish, overblown comic-book action movie, except with a female protagonist.<br/><br/>Actually, this is worse than the average comic book movie, because it preaches to the audience about pacifism but then hypocritically celebrates \"heroic\" violence. In other words: Wonder Woman is an alleged pacifist who kills a bunch of people. Wonder Woman is also an alleged feminist, who allows Steve Trevor to drive the entire plot and basically steal the movie from her. Really, this thing is about as progressive as Dick Cheney's great-great grandfather.<br/><br/>I could forgive Wonder Woman's flimsy social commentary, if it were any good in other respects. But the plot is loose and shabby, the CGI is poor, and about half the scenes were shot in front of a green screen. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if I was watching a real movie, or Patty Jenkins playing God of War on her Playstation 2. (When exactly did cinema and video games blend into this horrible hybrid art form, which has none of the beauty and charm of old-school cinema?)<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the villains. The World War I era Germans are depicted as cartoonishly eeeevil, while the same era's British Empire is held up as a heroic ideal. Meanwhile, the main villain is a nightmare of bad CGI, who looks like he belongs on a 1980s heavy metal album cover. Naturally, they got a wonderful actor for this stupid part and wasted him entirely.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm going overboard on criticisms, but we need some balance to the rapturous praise this film has received. Movie fans often accuse professional critics of being too harsh, but lately, I think critics have actually become too lenient. Mainstream movies get dumber, louder and tackier all the time, and they are increasingly substituting mawkishness for real emotion and character development. And yet the critics have given this thing a great Rotten Tomatoes rating! I guess we've all lowered our standards to rock bottom?",
    "I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on \"the list\" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like \"Superbad\", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of \"40 Year Old Virgin\", \"Superbad\", or \"Knocked Up\".<br/><br/>For starters, there was a definite presence of the \"TV actors on the big screen\" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of \"That 70s Show\" didn't follow her to \"Forgetting\"'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that \"Forgetting\" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than \"American Psycho 2\" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.<br/><br/>The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.<br/><br/>The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on \"CSI\") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious \"American Psycho 2\"); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with \"Superbad\"). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt \"Knocked Up\"). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write \"Fun with Dick and Jane\".<br/><br/>All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically.",
    "Eclipse is the beset Twilight movie so far and now I'm starting to give this series a little mercy. Yes, the writing is still bad, the CGI is awful, there's no chemistry between the leads, there's a lot of laughable dialogue, and terrible characters, but I enjoyed the movie and that's what movies are supposed to do. I'm actually going to watch the next movie with an open mind even if this movie wasn't that good.",
    "I'm a huge fan of the first Shrek and the second one also exceeded my expectations. Both of those movies had an meaningful and multidimensional plot. They also shared clever humor and for the most part unpredictable. I was extremely excited for the the third movie and I have to unfortunately say I was totally disappointed! The whole time I was waiting for it to start, like trying to convince myself, \"ok, any second now it will pick up\" - but it never did. The plot is so thin and unexciting - Prince Charming wants to takeover the throne while Shrek wants to get a young (King) Arthur to replace him as next in line to the throne. You never really feel any interest in what is happening or what will happen to the characters because you know exactly whats going to happen. Basically I spent the movie forcing myself to laugh because, hey, I was watching a Shrek movie. I know this review will not stop anyone who loved the previous movies from going to the third, but I just want to warn that its nothing to rush to or stand in line for.",
    "Talk about an appropriate title. <br/><br/>This is a collection of 11 short stories directed by indie stalwart Jim Jarmusch (\"Strangers in Paradise\", \"Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai\") that have been filmed over the last 18 years, all of which involve two or more characters simply sitting at a table, conversing over...yep, coffee and cigarettes. <br/><br/>In the hands of a lesser director that might be extremely boring, but Jarmusch is a master of subtle understatement and great deadpan humor. This may be one of the funniest movies you've ever seen in which no one cracks a smile. <br/><br/>Almost all the actors play themselves, which adds a meta-theatrical, slightly surreal touch to it all. <br/><br/>Among my favorite stories are one in which an overly eager Alfred Molina has a surprise in store for coolly arrogant fellow actor Steve Coogan and a great one in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin Shelby. Then there's the one where Tom Waits and Iggy Pop meet in a dive bar to discuss things and have a smoke (to celebrate quitting smoking), Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes experimenting with a Tesla coil, and in the funniest casting, RZA and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan sharing some downtime with, of all people, Bill Murray. I also like the one with Spike Lee's twin siblings, Joie and Cinque, dealing with an invasive waiter (a hilarious Steve Buscemi). Almost all the stories are excellent, but there are three that are very forgettable and pretty unnecessary, and they're all in a row, which disrupts the flow of the film. If those three had been taken out, \"Coffee and Cigarettes\" would be just about perfect, but it's still really good. And those three are out of the way in the first half, anyway.<br/><br/>\nFor the first hour the movie feels mainly just like fun. Straight-faced, deadpan, B&W comedy just like \"Strangers In Paradise\". But as it goes on, and strange connections are made between the stories, it seems to have a sudden dreamlike depth to it. <br/><br/>The final story in particular, in which two old men in a dark room (Bill Rice and Taylor Mead) discuss life while on a coffee break that feels like it'll last forever, has a distinct \"Waiting For Godot\" feel and ends the movie on a perfect note of haunting, existential sadness.<br/><br/>\nIt was at that point that I realized I hadn't just watched a string of jokey short stories, but a string of jokey short stories that say a lot about human nature and life in general. <br/><br/>And if that's not enough to interest you, how often do you get to see Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have a conversation?

    "Advocacy learning has demonstrated strong promise for many domains and we are rapidly becoming accustomed to applying this approach. However, few datasets have been studied experimentally with adversarial training such as the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task, which includes more than 500 million trials over almost two decades. Here, we propose an approach that allows generating ad-hoc networks through supervised, unconstrained sampling, enabling robust training even on data not suitable or appropriate for other methods. As in previous approaches (e.g., refs. 25⇓–27), our framework is based upon factorisation of the latent representations of discrete classes into more interpretable clusters by reducing their inter-class similarity; however, by adopting an extra layer between these hidden states, our generative model can represent high dimensional features efficiently without being trained in advance.\n\nThese ideas also appear in Nils Brauer's work, The Design (or Lack thereof) Of Learning From Imperfect Data; A Perspective On Support Vector Machines With Generalization Problems, but they're more developed here, with some really neat implementation examples at the end.

    "We present a new method of visualizing semantic relationships between visual features and language in scenes using semantic segmentation. Our system's high degree of generativity makes it a suitable candidate for visualizing complex relationships in a generative picture language.\n\nOur work is based primarily on the theory of visualizing the semantic relationships between features in scenes, inspired by the ideas in Büchner et al.'s Theories of Semantic Visualization thesis [1]. We consider the problem of visualizing semantic relationships between two visual features, such as an object and an object feature respectively. This approach is inspired by visualizing the semantic relationships between visual features in the natural world (see this paper for further details) when considering the relationships of two complex, spatially distributed sequences of features. In particular, we consider the problem of visualizing a semantic relationship between, for example, a location and a location feature (here, the features at two locations on the scene).\n\nFor example, consider two examples:\n\nA scene in which there are, in addition to the location feature, six features corresponding to motion direction.\n\nA non-artistic scene in which there are, in addition to the location feature, three features corresponding to time of day.\n\nWe are presented with a way to visualize relationships between these two situations with respect to the feature sequence of the non-artistic scene. For the purposes of illustration we are only interested in the question of whether there is a spatial relationship in the visual features of the two scenes.\n\nWe present general techniques we use to solve this problem, which in the future may be used effectively to perform similar tasks on scenes from diverse genres, different disciplines, and with different features, in different domains.\n\nOur results show that our method does produce a well-organized graph where the semantic relationships within a given image sequence is well preserved across different scenes. Moreover, our results show that the semantics of an image sequence can be visualized through a visual representation of its semantic relationships. This visualization technique provides a means for the visualization of semantic relationships between a visual feature in a scene. When visualized, the semantic relationships can be compared visually to visual features from different, different domains, such as music visualizations, or even a 3D scene rendered from various types of data.\n\nThe Semantic",

The algorithm is based on the fact that the distance between any pair of points in Euclidean space is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances between them. We show that this result holds even if we assume that the set of points has no boundary. This implies that the C-W equivalence is equivalent to the Euclidean equivalence. In particular, it follows that the C-W equivalence is equivalent to the Euclidean equivalence when the distance between two points is less than or equal to the square root of 2.",

This is called 'chebyverification', and while it isn't as common as other problems of this nature (e.g., rewriting every time using brute force), it can still be disastrous.

    "Non-Measurable Unions in the Presence of Arbitrary Nonlinearity\n\nIn this work, we study the effect of arbitrary nonlinearity on the behavior of non-measurable unions. We show that if one has an arbitrary nonlinearity, then the union of two sets of elements can be described by a linear combination of these sets. This means that the union of two sets of elements can be described as a sum of linear combinations of their components. In other words, the union of two sets of elements can be described as a linear combination of their component sums. The existence of such a linear combination implies that there exists a set of all possible linear combinations of the union of two sets of elements. If one has an arbitrary nonlinearity, then it follows that the union of two sets of elements cannot be described by any linear combination of its components. Thus, the union of two sets of elements cannot be described as a linear combination of their component sums.\n\nWe prove that the above statement holds even when the union of two sets of elements is not commutative and that the above statement holds even when the union of two sets of elements is not associative.\n\nThis work was done with the help of the following resources:",

    "In this work we investigate the use of high dimensional sparse filters for image filtering, focusing on the problem of image filtering with noisy data and limited capacity. We show how to apply this filtering method to a range of applications in image processing, particularly deep learning, by building a scalable BNF-like model that can adaptively learn to deal with the noisy data, and by employing the high-dimensional sparse linear algebra to efficiently scale up image filtering. Our model learns to handle arbitrary sparsely shaped data efficiently, using a high dimensional non-linearity in the input space and high dimensional non-linearity in the output space. The result is efficient implementation of simple filtering algorithms and a complete characterization of the framework's performance. In particular, we show for a range of image datasets, both for both real and n-dimensional sparse data, that training is achievable through a combination of parallel filtering and parallel sparse linear algebra. Our results also show that this system can be extended to handle large datasets, without requiring additional feature engineering.\n\nWe demonstrate two main results. First, we make use of the scaling technique proposed in this article, to achieve efficient scaling of high-dimensional sparse linear algebra representations on a GPU. Second, our framework can also provide an alternative form of feature engineering that allows the model to learn to do a variety of filtering tasks, such as bilinear filtering, soft and hard soft-edge detection, and fuzzy feature engineering.\n\nThe video gives a good description of the research, showing a few examples of both the parallel and the parallel sparse linear algebra pipelines.\n\nI want to thank Paul Chudnovsky and Ben DeZeeuw for helpful discussions, and I would like to extend a huge thank you to Alex Graves and his folks at Deep Learning Systems for making this work possible.

    "This paper presents the implementation of the adversarial constraint-based CNN with a large vocabulary. In contrast with previous efforts we employ fully connected components, which allows us to achieve better performance under unsupervised, multi-label classification tasks. All of our classes are implemented in the fully connected layer based on the adversarial constraint-based training framework proposed in [Sharma19][Keen21]. However, unlike traditional adversarial training, the CNN is trained directly and never participates in the learning process. We demonstrate significant improvement in classification accuracy in the unsupervised task in two different images of the same patient based only on the original CNN structure and using a large natural vocabulary. Using the adversarial structure, each CNN class is trained with different weights, and the resulting loss of each type of CNN is computed. Our approach achieves robustness and speed in comparison with the traditional approach.\n\nThis is definitely a big first step in the AI space here, and while they say this will be implemented in a medical imaging application, you could easily run the same approach on any subject, especially in the domain of medical imaging, which needs some type of classification to distinguish between healthy and sick people. From where we are standing, we can't tell you exactly how that will play out in the real world, but we're not exactly betting against it having some serious, positive effects.\n\n[image credit: iStock]",

    "High-dimensional estimating equations (HEDE) have broad applications, in the domains of biomedical drug discovery, biophysical dynamics, and environmental economics. The generalization techniques that have allowed us to create high-dimensional HEDE models are not very useful, at least in practice. To gain a practical insight on the difficulties we have encountered in doing so, we present a numerical example of the process we have been describing, along with two variants (with different numbers of dimension) where it is not possible to solve the equations. We also present a proof of the completeness of the technique. Our analysis focuses on the case where an arbitrary data set can be represented as a sum of \"subspaces\" containing \"values,\" and are not constrained to have certain properties. We propose a more general strategy to estimate models, to be used with higher-dimensional data sets that have at least the dimension that is needed. We show that with such data, we can model many important phenomena in physics and biology, notably biological macromolecular interactions, electrochemical and molecular dissociation, and non-equilibrium electron transfer processes. While a certain amount of computational effort is necessary in the case of simple models without constraints on the size of the spatial dimensions of the model, our approach is well suited for models with arbitrary spatial dimensions.\n\nThe full paper has been published in Nature Communications: \"Hierarchical and Multidimensional Estimating Equations for Physical Models with High Dimensionality.\"\n\nI've always been a huge fan of the idea of \"higher order approximations\" – in particular, the idea that we can use higher level approximations and use them to do things we could not do before.

I have been watching this potential (and I have to say I am not disappointed) with a mixture of glee and trepidation, and I'm excited to be part of the DFT effort (and excited to see what comes of it)",

    "Abstract The distorted mirror of Wikipedia (DM) has been widely discussed in academic circles, and its impact on scholarly communication has been studied by several researchers. This study examines the extent to which Wikipedia articles about academics are biased against them. We find that DM articles tend to be more negative than those about other fields, but this effect is not significant when we control for the number of citations to these articles. In addition, we show that the bias is driven by the fact that Wikipedia articles about academics have fewer references to their work than do articles about other disciplines. These results suggest that Wikipedia's focus on the humanities may lead it to produce an overly positive view of academia.\nThis is a very interesting study. I think it does a good job of showing how Wikipedia can skew the way people perceive certain topics. It also shows that there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of how Wikipedia presents information about academics. For example, if you look at the article on the University of California system, it says that UC Berkeley is one of the top ten universities in the world, yet it doesn't mention that they're ranked #1 in the US. That would be a much better representation of what the university actually is.\nI'm sure there will be some who say that this isn't really relevant because Wikipedia is just a collection of random links to other websites. But I don't see how that could possibly be true. If Wikipedia was just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it had a problem? And if Wikipedia were just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why didn't anyone notice that it was being edited by a group of editors with a clear agenda?\nIf Wikipedia is just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it had a problem?\nAnd if Wikipedia is just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it was being edited by a group of editors with a clear agenda?\nIt seems like a pretty big deal that Wikipedia is being used as a source of information about academics.

    "Abstract While much has been written about prompt generation for DEL, it remains highly problematic to reliably produce the output given many different environment parameters - some difficult and others obvious like an ENV variable's value and configuration of.NET's eventing infrastructure. The primary problem can be summarized as follows: To obtain reliable and predictable outputs from simple, dynamic input, a generator should be composed to use standard environment variables where possible and otherwise invoke built in function such as shell commands or batch file parsing that does not rely on the current environment. In addition to being less error prone because one does not need to make hard assumptions on the input, this design methodology reduces reliance on libraries (such as CSPRNGs ) which are susceptible to changes during runtime in order to exploit specific inputs within the program. However this approach still requires careful manual effort to ensure no data gets accidentally overwritten because any number of errors can result when entering unknown variables while running DEVELOPER'S CHILD with some kind of custom logic involving INPUT's,.NET's Eventing Frameworks, etc.\nWhile there are multiple approaches to dynamically create these environments (often named \"Del\", \"DELIMEPLATIONER \", \"dynamic prompt generation \" or even just DEL_SEARCH_DEPL) they invariably fall short due to the necessity (at least in my experience) of ensuring most of the initial input contains a string like /bin/bash in its name. This makes them extremely resource intensive, expensive in terms of CPU usage, require having an entire interpreter to run on your computer and, as a side effect, limits their flexibility due to the fact that most people have limited familiarity with how languages work internally until they actually need to interact with those languages to generate an environment out of input. Since I'm looking at the topic as a programmer who is very concerned with maintaining his programming language knowledge through active practice so while these features may get new features added quickly into existing programming environments they won't necessarily change something that is fundamental to what I take pride in when using an existing programming language. While most of us will probably never see that feature enabled by default within our editors, IDEs or other programs we often do need to enter inputs that start with bash ; or command line arguments that start with \\; etc. But how often do we encounter prompts from",

We present a statistical model that quantifies the contribution of dental biofilms to oral health by using a novel approach based on the analysis of data from a large cohort of patients with periodontal diseases. Our results show that dental biofilms contribute significantly to the development of periodontitis, whereas they do not affect the severity or persistence of gum disease. The model also shows that the presence of dental biofilms does not predict the risk of developing periodontitis. These findings suggest that dental biofilms may be useful as biomarkers for the assessment of periodontal disease, but further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

    "\"In this paper, we present a new approach for facial landmark detection, based on deep learning, that combines multiple deep neural networks into a single super-trained system for facial landmark recognition. Our system can learn to extract landmarks from any object feature image, including ones that are not directly visible, or for example when a human's face is obscured by an object. We present extensive analyses showing that our algorithm can accurately predict facial landmark attributes in the absence of extensive landmark knowledge, and also demonstrate its ability to converge on a human-recognized human face. Our data set is enriched with a relatively large number of human faces that are well known to both computer vision researchers and general users, which makes our task interesting for both researchers and users.\n\nThe current state of facial recognition technologies is centered around automated analysis of images, mainly from online sources. While human recognition, also known as face detection, is an important research topic for the future, the current state of automated computer vision has focused on simple face detection, such as recognizing face, or face contours; detecting the distance between two objects; or recognizing a single shape features. The aim of this work is to find a more comprehensive approach or paradigm for facial detection, which will enable computer vision research to be carried out in a more advanced manner in the near future. Our proposed approach uses several deep learning models to represent the features of the human face, and combines these with the knowledge of each feature in order to model the user's facial expressions, thereby creating a novel facial detection framework. The proposed approach enables machine learning to deal with complex and diverse problems, ranging from tracking the facial movements of faces, to detecting facial distortions. Our results support the idea that deep learning has the potential to increase computational efficiency and make computer vision accessible to a large community of researchers.\n\nThe goal of this work is to demonstrate that deep learning achieves super-realtime facial landmark detection. With this approach, the neural networks can learn to discover landmarks on the basis of unsupervised feature learning, to achieve a state-of-the-art performance of 6.4% in a task where only 20% of the images were annotated with landmark boundaries. To demonstrate the validity of our work, we analyzed the accuracy and accuracy of our proposed approach against the state-of-the-art of existing",
    "Observations of an EXO-200 background in radioactive rock obtained from the Mt. Baker–Snoqualmie National Monument in Washington State indicate that the emission of radioactivity from the radioactive geochemistry of the rock is significantly higher than that of natural geological sources, probably due to a very high rate of radioactive decay in the rock. This background has been detected at a number of distances from the source, implying that the background must arise from a physical process, possibly due to the interaction between the geochemistry of the rock and an external field. A comparison between the background-induced emissions and background values of ambient background radiation suggests that the background was generated by radioiodine decay.\n\nThe article also includes the following short, but very useful, video clip from a presentation called \"How a Geologist Obtains a Radioactive Background for Exo-200\" by David M.

    "\"Our main idea in this paper is about the efficient evaluation of a compact version of product or product space. According to this strategy, a compact space consists of a set of linear products, and a set of linear filters over this set. Here, linear maps are used to specify the compactness property of the (filtered) compact set of products, which are known as product space. In our case, we evaluate the composition of a linear map with the product space itself by selecting at random a linear map of all fixed dimensions. In contrast to other work, we do not specify, at first sight, a specific choice of \"product\", but rather take the property of nonlinearity of the filters. Such a property, which is not known to the author of such analysis, is not easily definable by using finite series or other traditional nonlinearity tests. In addition to the usual nonlinearity tests, we also take advantage of the property of compactness to the filter, which gives a good approximation to the nonlinearity. As a consequence, using a product space as an efficient (or inefficient) measure for the nonlinearity of a filter is both correct and a generalization of the usual nonlinearity tests from regularity to compactness. Concretely, we first introduce an optimization scheme that we call \"narrower product space,\" which we prove that a compact compact collection of products (or products of filters) will be compact if and only if both this compact collection and the selected filter have a finite complement. In other words, the selection of a filter in the product space must be as specific as that of a linear map in the collection space. A generalization of our method is that any fixed pair of linear maps can be selected without restriction by simply selecting random elements from the selection between them. Moreover, given a \"filter\" and some product space, we show that this product space is always compact, and thus compact in any sense in which product space is defined in an efficient and general way. \"\n\n\nHere is an animation of our proof in practice:",

In this way, data can be transmitted without loss or errors over distances exceeding several kcm. We address other challenges such as high quality interconnects, energy management and efficient use of laser power.

    "In this work we address a novel form of sputter on polar surfaces, where multiple particles are produced by light trapped within a rotating beam cavity. The result can be defined as an interference pattern, which may show up either symmetrically with respect to the orientation of particle origin/destination or asymmetric. Similar results were obtained previously using light trapping on metallic surfaces using a highly modified type of rotary tunneling microscope (MTM) [4], which permitted a large number of particle pairs in exchange (see Methods). In particular, we exploit this method on thin film graphene prepared in a three-dimensional channel. When one single pair of electrons is transferred across each graphene molecule at a single energy level, an electric potential difference and electromagnetic force arise between two adjacent pairs, that induces their formation in the same direction. As in the case of optical trapping on the metal substrate, we observe a rotation and sputtering effect at much lower frequencies when several such pairs occur in simultaneous locations along a given longitudinal axis [5]. At low atomic voltage (~8 eV), the resulting forces lead to emission waves emanating from nearby electrode locations (E i and E j ) that propagate along the surface, generating a complex system of correlated electronic charge density fluctuations that propagate outwardly throughout the entire sample length. These electric fields are more prevalent near edge regions due to the polarization angle between charged electron centers and oxygen atoms that is slightly different from the normal polarity of oxygen molecules. Since both center charges have approximately 180° symmetry, they create opposite electrical currents and magnetic moments, similar to those found for circular polarized beams (e.g., CVDs; Fig. 3a) whose induced electromagnetic field tends to push electrons toward one another. Thus for our experimental probe setup, only the most intense energy levels are capable of driving these effects on solid films on both sides of a vertical plane perpendicular to the original direction of motion. We also find that while all electron emissions generated upon interaction are directed away from the electrodes owing to the current dependence, the emitted trajectories remain distinct in various orientations depending on the applied directional magnetic field. Because spatial separation and polarization are extremely important parameters in the underlying mechanism (i.e., interparticle electric dipoles during particle generation and then recombination and spin dynamics), they determine how spatially separated excitations generate a complex wavefield with distinctive",

    "In this article we show how to ensure that parallel computations achieve their goal: they are evaluated serially on the same datapoints, and their results are evaluated at the same point in time. Although a parallel implementation may be possible in some cases; in reality a parallel implementation usually requires the addition of some overhead. In this article we present the design and details about a new optimizer, which ensures that parallel computation always is uniform across datasets. This optimizer is based on the concept of Uniform Sparsity, which ensures that a set of parallel computations have the same distribution of their results. We show how to implement this optimizer in the language of Haskell, a language which, apart from its powerful type system, boasts some of the most efficient and robust parallel execution models to date. The optimizer is called \"Tortoise\", for obvious reasons.\n(A side story: one of the early authors of this paper was also a programmer who wrote the serializer for various.NET serializers – this lead to a meeting in which it was decided to name it \"Tortoise\".)\nIn the paper \"Sparsity and Parallel Acquisition: Optimal Uniform and Nonuniform Acceleration\" [pdf] it was found that uniformization is an essential requirement for many algorithms. In fact, linear algebraic and other such parallel algorithms require uniform parallel processing.\nWhile uniform parallelization leads to great performance, it has a negative impact on certain algorithms. On the other hand, uniform computation, by its very nature, produces a monotonic distribution of results, which results in lower latency – both for code reading and code writing. This fact is well documented, however, and in many cases we will see that the loss in performance is insignificant in many cases. This was the case for the fast algorithms in the paper. However, some slow algorithms were shown to benefit from uniformization. For example, the algorithm to split a list into two sorted lists, has a uniform time step in its parallel computation. But in practice this is not the case, and the parallel algorithm will not always achieve uniform time step on each invocation. The reason being that the algorithm performs much better on smaller lists.\nWhile performing parallel acquisition, the time can be divided into two parts: (1)\nA collection of data objects A collection",
    "Abstract A maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of abelians on different manifolds with topological invariant representations leads to remarkable results such as the creation of axioms of bifurcations at any abelian group. The axiomatics here are of relatively little interest, however, since they arise within an idealization of Banach algebras that can be represented by a single graph R(|R|). The current work extends the idea beyond the trivialization of this graph R using additional graphs R′′ which correspond both to higher order operators of the Lie algebra \\eta and its extension R(|φ|). The new theory generates unique monoidal structures called maximal abelian subalgebras over these extra 2-manifold graphs, where each vertex must correspond to a different operator. We provide some simple examples including one over the symmetric 4-topology B ( ρ | ϣ ) and three over B ( ⊗, π : p | γ ⟶ σ ). Here we prove important properties such as a proof of (1-)of universal completeness for all extensions of C*B to the above structure, and (2)-convexes in this general case. In fact, our results imply what might have been taken for granted only in the past century.\nAs explained earlier I know of much of the work involved in a somewhat less formalized context. If someone has a more complete account feel free to post it here in the comments so other readers may see more details.\nFor those interested the result was published in Numerical Mathematics.",

Our approach is inspired by the work (i) of Chown et al. [1] and refined upon them; and (ii) of Yudkowsky & Jirsa [2] who achieved the same effect using non-resolvable neural networks with no fixed size, allowing them to be trained via stochastic gradient descent in sparse images. However SynNet's learning rate is variable among layers, making it suitable for use at an intermediate level within a dataset requiring sparsely connected, high dimensional representations instead of just continuous features. For this reason we also provide implementations of SynNet for nlmsolver [3], the OpenCog[4], VGG[5], HUDS[6]; for example. SynNet implements both forward inference and backward propagation through time based prediction functions, which together achieve the same end goal while having independent advantages per problem domain: deep, invariant inference while retaining generality, and fast-paced prediction with improved accuracy if our initial predictions are not perfect. The main advantages of this technique lie in its compact implementation, which allows high precision training directly from the raw input image and efficient memory management (e.g., on CPU) for storing intermediate representations inside the recurrent connections and minimizing computation time. As mentioned before, it has been demonstrated to support state-of-the-art results and outperforms other techniques such as Gaussian processes on medical imaging tasks [7]. We also propose theoretical explanations to explain how our method achieves these impressive performances even though these theories can't explicitly account for all reasons why SynNet achieves comparable accuracy to current state-of-the-art methods that combine many small hidden units into single layer networks but operate on mathematically equivalent classes of sequences.",
    "Introduction As in any domain, and particularly in medicine, data sets are continuously growing exponentially, and as many of these collections grow, so does the challenge in processing the huge amounts of training data they contain. What can be done to tackle this problem? How can we make it possible in practice for individuals to train models without having lots of time waiting at their machines (like for the famous PASCAL VOC), or the budget available for them, like for medical researchers (which happens sometimes)? In this work, we have studied two techniques which involve explicit information being fed into an implementation of neural networks on a graphical user interface to speed up analysis, i.e. the'small-sampling' method and the deep learning technique named for its use of multiple hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. In addition, it contains an optimisation scheme used to estimate parameters in some submodel during training. Both methods are trained upon MNIST dataset using random sampling. To illustrate our approach, some figures describing MNIST image labels showing both learning curves were generated for some specific examples: The two learning curves may give one the impression that what we achieved seems simple but it turns out that both approaches are quite complex, even when the objective functions remain straightforward. For example, our optimisation scheme tries to estimate the values of the latent variables for each subroutine separately. We then convert those values to weights for inference in the form of gradient descent. We also show how we compute a confidence interval around such estimates by setting the posterior distribution for each variable and applying our algorithm to the samples given by sampling from the expected probability distribution. Finally, because submodels will need to be learnt simultaneously on the first few observations only, many more neurons are required and so the total number of connections in the network does not exactly match the training number per subnetwork. Even after fitting a linear model, we still see overfitting leading to spurious predictions and false positives if some sub-models actually get underfit due to low coverage when actual error is high. This means it is often necessary to perform some type of regularisation to reduce overfitting while preserving precision before applying the regression-based optimization strategy mentioned earlier. Moreover, it should also be noted that such methods could benefit from further optimizations which we have discussed previously such as the optimization to account for interactions between components/functions",

    "Abstract The goal of this work was to investigate the effect of multiple targets on the non-coherence of MIMO radar with multiple targets (MIMO) and to determine whether the effects are due to the presence or absence of noise sources. We used an experimental setup consisting of two MIMO antennas, one located at each end of a 2m long optical fiber cable. A single target antenna was placed at the center of the cable. Two different types of noise sources were employed: a low frequency (LF) source that produces a continuous signal and a high frequency (HF) source that generates a periodic signal. In addition, we varied the number of targets per antenna. The results show that the LF source has no significant effect on the non-coherence of the system. However, when there are more than three targets, the HF source significantly reduces the non-coherence of the system. This reduction can be attributed to the fact that the RF energy emitted by the LF source is absorbed by the air molecules in the vicinity of the antenna. The results also indicate that the presence of noise sources does not affect the performance of the system.",
    "We present an approach to semantic segmentation that uses domain adaptation and a novel neural network architecture to achieve high-quality results in image classification tasks. We show how our method can be used to improve the accuracy of medical imaging diagnosis, by using it to extract features from images that are not directly visible to the human eye. Our algorithm achieves this by exploiting the fact that the brain has evolved to process visual information in a way that minimizes the amount of data needed to reconstruct the original scene. In particular, we exploit the fact that the brain's receptive field (the area of maximum activity) is highly correlated with its spatial resolution. This allows us to use the same feature space as the brain does, but with much smaller datasets. The resulting system is able to detect objects in images at resolutions up to 1 mm × 1 mm × 0.5 mm, which is comparable to the resolution of most commercial MRI scanners. Furthermore, our system is capable of detecting objects in images at resolutions up to 2 mm × 2 mm × 0.1 mm, which is comparable to the resolution of many commercially available 3D scanners. These results demonstrate that our technique can be applied to a wide range of problems involving image processing, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and face recognition.",

    "Abstract:\n\nWe have computed, over 10 different time scales, the sum of the average sum of the power fluxes of the sum of the strong decays of four types of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs): the light ones (the top 5% of the mass line), and two classes of heavier ones called b-mesons and muons. The WIMPs are emitted by black holes at the centers of quasar halos and in the core of active galactic nuclei. Here the WIMPs correspond to the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) line at energies between 11 and 16 TeV. By comparing the results with those from earlier studies, we show that the total emission from the four types of WIMPS during the 2023 summit is ~50,000 fb-1 cm-2 at a time interval of a few days. The summit-time spectrum (SST) is dominated by two type-I WIMPs. These are the heavy WIMPs that emit most of their radiation in the optical, and type-II WIMPs, which make up a large fraction of the light WIMP spectrum. The total peak-brightness of type-II WIMPs is significantly larger than from any other WIMP type. The total peak brightness of type-I WIMPs is significantly smaller than from any other WIMP type. We have found that the top two top qubit (type-I) WIMPs are the dominant top qubit radiation at time scales of the order of days. In addition, we have found the first direct evidence for a new WIMP category (type-I+IIb) that is slightly heavier than type-IIb WIMPs.\n\nFollow Ups:\n\nWe also had the opportunity to interview Daniel Roth, one of the co-authors.\n\nA version of this post was first published on Physics arXiv.",
    "Software-Defined Constrained Optimization (SDOCP) is an emerging field in which software engineers are able to design and implement algorithms that can be used to optimize routing protocols, such as Ethernet or IP. The goal of this work is to develop a new algorithm for optimizing SCOR on top of the existing SCOR protocol. We present a novel approach based on a combination of two techniques: (i) a probabilistic programming framework and (ii) a dynamic programming language. Our method allows us to define a set of constraints that describe how we want our network to behave, and then use these constraints to generate optimal solutions. This approach has several advantages over traditional approaches, including its ability to leverage the power of modern computer hardware. In particular, it enables us to efficiently compute the optimal solution even when the number of nodes in the network grows exponentially with time.",

    "Abstract The relative wavelength dependence of the IR lag in active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been studied extensively, but its significance remains unclear. Here we present an analysis of the IR lag in AGN using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the IR lag is independent of the distance to the galaxy and the type of star forming region within it. This result implies that the IR lag is not due to the presence of a large number of stars or gas clouds in the vicinity of the galaxy. Instead, our results suggest that the IR lag may be caused by the interaction between the interstellar medium and the interstellar magnetic field. Our results also indicate that the IR lag is significantly smaller than previously thought.",

    "In this paper, we present a novel technique for solving the Gaussian mixture modeling problem. The method is based on the stochastic nature of the latent-variable distribution and the nonlinear dynamics of the latent-variable system. We first derive a robust MCMC method for the problem by variationally averaging the parameters of the latent-variable distributions. We then construct a variational bayesian clustering algorithm to perform the shape estimation. We demonstrate that our method improves the accuracy of shape approximation, improves the variance of shape estimates, and reduces the time needed to solve image segmentation in a wide variety of image recognition tasks.\n\nNow that is a neat piece of the picture. The most exciting part of this paper is the discussion of shape samplers, and how to do them. They start with the following definitions: \"We define a shape sampler as a function that has two fixed parameters and behaves as follows. First, it is defined as a function of the latent-variable values for a particular image and state space. We denote the estimated gradient of the function with respect to the estimated gradient for any image and state space from the image and state space, respectively.\"\n\nAnd \"We compute an MCMC sample of form, where the parameters, and are the estimated parameter estimates for the shape value and shape segmentation functions, respectively.\n\nI do not know the author to this point, but I have no doubt it is a nice paper. And as a bonus of finding it, it allows us to see a graphical representation of how to perform shape sampling. In their example image from above, the author shows some of the \"samples.\" As might be guessed, an image from a sphere will produce a relatively sparse result. A bit more complex image will yield much more dense results.\n\nNow, you're probably thinking that I'm just being silly here. \"Look at those shapes!\"\n\nYou're absolutely right. After all, you might not have figured out what the author was proposing, but I do think it is a very impressive result.\n\nOne key in their method is that you just do shape sampling with the parameter sampler, which is a bit like using shape vectors to measure distances between shapes.

Here we report on the experimental realization of TTl using a linear dispersive filter (LDF).

Our results indicate that the time-reversed light emitted by an LDF can be reversed by applying a second LDF to the first one.",
    "This paper provides a critical theoretical understanding of the Whitney distortion extension (WoE) problem for the $\\mathbb R^n$-dimensional manifold. The WoE problem is the extension to the 3-dimensional $R^3(\\mathbb R^n)\\times\\mathbb R^n$ manifold of the Whitney transform, a problem of central importance for the theory of approximate local-space geometries.\nAlthough the Whitney transform is not very popular as a non-local-space geometrical operator, the Woe problem as far as its use in the theory of approximating local spaces is concerned is more widely studied. The Whitney transform extends the notion of a local space to include a structure of $R^n$-spaces. Moreover, it allows to model most of the structures of local-space geometries. The WOE problem has important applications to all of that theory, and can only be solved in local-space geometries. We study both an example $R$-algebraic space to test the WoE problem and a concrete case with a lattice of Woe curves on $(1,\\infty)$, whose structure we approximate locally with a network with two lattice nodes per lattice-pair.\nA quick summary follows:\nThe WoE problem arises as a consequence of the fact that our lattice cannot be approximated with a network of length zero, but only with a lattice of Woe curves\nA simple instance of WoE arises for a network of lengths one. But this instance can be modified, to have any lattice with zero lattice-pair distances\nThe simple set $L = \\{1,2,\\ldots, n$ of lattices of the form $(n,n)/(n-1)$ with $m$-1 vertices is sufficient for the WoE problem, but the exact set will depend on how large the local-space elements of $L$ are: the exact number of lattice-pairs is a parameter that can be chosen arbitrarily (we assume for illustrative purposes that the",
    "\"The quantum-classical phase transition can be described by an efficient nonlocal system for a single photon. In reality, the quantum system is a superposition of two different states, but the quantum state can be manipulated by a single photon. These nonlocale states are represented by classical solutions on a superposition space on the superposition space. These classical solutions are a quantum system, the classical states of the photons are the solutions to the classical wave equation, and the quantum amplitude of the particle and its position is the result of a stochastic process. A single photon can be used to entangle two classical waves. By using a single photon coupled with a single classical wave, we show that the system can be manipulated until a complete superposition is achieved. We show that the system can be manipulated such that for any single photon entangled with a state, the phase can only change if it is affected by an incident photon with a different state. Our results show that a quantum state is not just composed of a single coherent quantum photon but that a particle interacts with its environment according to the wave rule and not only the classical rules. This quantum state corresponds to a macroscopic single photon and it can be defined in two ways, that is the phase can be defined as the difference of two states, which changes with the presence of an electromagnetic wave, or if the phase can only change when an incident photon with a different state is introduced. A single photon can be used to entangle two classical waves, resulting in spontaneous superposition breaking, where a quantum state cannot be characterized strictly by the photon's frequency. When the classical state of the photon of a superposition is entangled with a classical state of the photon's wave particle, a quantum state may exist for long time periods in which no outgoing photons are detected and the photon is not subject to any disturbance. The quantum state of the wave particle is not affected by an interaction between two photons.\" For further information, to view the full paper please visit the arxiv.org site.",
    "A global assessment over different satellite sensors reveals that our ability to characterize and model Earth's surface in relation to its topography varies by sensor type, season and lat/lon coordinates, and that it is difficult to apply standard land cover models on these data sets. Landcover transformation algorithms are currently being applied at field scale on these large-scale datasets without an appropriate knowledge of their spatial extent. Here we demonstrate how we can transform the land cover data on two Landsat 8+ and Sentinel 2 channels through two-way transformation between land cover classification codes. This makes it possible to classify an arbitrary subset (or subsets) of land area based on a few metrics commonly used in local assessment and land cover modeling. We show that our technique outperforms other existing approaches when the features of the data contain spatial information such as elevation [elevated soil moisture or vegetation height] or slope [convexity angle]. We further demonstrate improved accuracy by combining this approach with a knowledge of Earth surface boundaries on both Earth and space, and we use it systematically to identify land features to improve Earth observation-driven monitoring of many components of land surface change.",
    "Abstract\n\nWe have tested the hypothesis that underdosing to CWE can give rise only to dynamic dynamics and no static, linear or kinematic effects. This would be the case if there were no d-type cw effect in either hydration behavior (proportional or inverse) or energetics; if each instance is independent of others and follows from the previous one. In order to test this we have investigated two different, related examples illustrating the nature of dynamic interactions with dNAPO: firstly a study of the energy balance on an inertial platform (i.e., where it is assumed that each individual holds its position), secondly the nonlinear effect of hyperhydration described by Schutze (1982). We have investigated both cases under diverse experimental conditions ranging from small mass transfer capacities (3 cm−1) to large ones in which every fluid passage takes 10 s. These results provide some insight into how energetics become dependent on external interactions and allow us to propose quantitative, analytical methods aimed at quantifying the role of these interactions on various aspects of physiology.",

    "\"The K\\\"ahler metric is an amoeba-like scale parameter that can be seen from infinity as an exponential function of the number of chromosomes, a property that makes the metric more interesting than the simpler M-S compact space. A finite measure of the probability of mutation for a given base or in a given set of chromosomes, known as the probability distribution function (PRF) of the genome, can be given as a function of the number of chromosomes and a particular number of chromosomes, termed the minimum number of chromosomes (MN), as given by the \"minimize size\" maximization problem. These distributions were first found to be related to the probability distribution function of the genome, or the K\\\"ahler function, by K. Sjostrom's original work, based on the K\\\"ahler metric. As for the original purpose of studying these distributions, to determine how small a number of chromosomes can be before their likelihood of mutation should be reduced, the original theory was that the MN was a constant under these models. A more direct derivation on the basis of linear model is given in a recently-published result. K. M. Baumstark's method on the K\\\"ahler function was, in fact, to first show that the M-S compactly homogeneous M-S space does not suffer from the same fundamental problems as the more traditional homogeneous M-S space with many chromosomes.

We show how to use this method to generate images from eye-movement data in real time, without requiring any special hardware or software. Our approach uses a novel neural network architecture based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent connections between layers. The CNNs are trained by applying a sequence of training examples to the input layer, which results in a set of weights that can be used to predict the next frame of the video. This allows us to extract features from the video such as eye position, orientation, and movement. We then apply our model to generate a series of frames from these features, and we compare the generated frames against those produced by hand-drawn animation. We find that our system produces significantly better results than hand-drawn animation, even when the number of frames per second is increased to 100 fps.",
    "This paper is an exercise in computational equivalence, in which a simple mathematical formula yields the same result as a more complex mathematical formula in a different setting. Thus, this paper is an attempt to derive the equivalence of the function c-Wilf on the rational numbers given the simple mathematical formula on which they are founded. The assumption is that two groups of rationals are equal to each other in every number field where they are definable, and the theorem to this effect is trivially true: for every finite field of real numbers, the field of rationals is the field of all integers. An alternative proof that the integers are the integers is known to be false, and a formal result to this effect is given independently by the same author. We now prove that the formula of calculus is adequate to show the equivalence of c-Wilf with this formula. It turns out to be a more complicated formula than the one we considered above, and some of the proofs do not seem to be quite right. It is conjectured that the formula is not sufficient to show that c-Wilf is equivalent to the integer epsilon, and that c-Wilf is equivalent to either 0 or epsilon, depending on the question of choice: either c-Wilf is equivalent to the rationals, or to numbers 0 or epsilon. This result is conjectured using basic probability theory, and the results seem to work, although not in the usual way. The motivation to this result is given as follows: The basic theorem shows that any interval is an interval of a certain size, so that all rational numbers from it are integers. An interval is the smallest unit that contains all the rational numbers. In the case of intervals, the question is whether the smallest interval contains all rationals, or contains some rational. For example, the integers, and in particular the set of all integers less than a fixed arbitrary number c, and the set of all rationals are bounded intervals, so that either c-Wilf is equivalent to an interval bounded by the integers and the rationals, or to a set of numbers less than some arbitrary number c. The basic theorem is a theorem of quotient modules: it is an important result that every interval, and, strictly speaking, the smallest finite set of integers that has all rationals in it, is an interval of",

    "We present an approach to segmenting cardiac tissue using strong anatomical guarantees, which allows us to reconstruct the entire heart in 3D and perform complex functional imaging studies on it. We show that our method can be used to accurately identify the location of the ventricles, the left atrium, the right ventricle, and the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) in vivo. Our results demonstrate that our technique provides a robust and accurate way to segment cardiac tissue, even when the tissue is not perfectly preserved. Furthermore, we show that our method can be applied to other tissues such as skeletal muscle or skin, and that it can provide high-resolution images of these tissues.",
    "Abstract\n\nWe present CAKES, an automatic channel-wise shrinking algorithm that automatically shrinks the size of a network by minimizing the cost function over all possible paths between nodes in the network. The algorithm is based on the idea that the optimal path through a network consists of two parts: (i) the shortest path to any node and (ii) the minimum number of hops required to reach each node. We show that CAKES can be used as a generalization of the standard k-means clustering algorithm to handle large networks with many edges. Our results demonstrate that CAKES can significantly reduce the computational time needed to perform k-means clustering.",

    "The flooding of natural systems is a fundamental concept in environmental science. The ability to form these networks is one of the most intriguing properties of biology. However, whether flood-filling can actually occur in natural systems is not well understood. Here, we present a novel model for flood-filling networks in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Two ANNs, one with hidden neurons and another with convolutional neural networks, can automatically form flood-filling nets for arbitrary datasets. Our models can take as input a simple population of simple populations. By constructing a high-order representation from two representations, respectively convolutional and softmax, we obtain a network that efficiently compresses and fills data. This is an important tool for studying the emergence of biologically relevant functions in natural systems. …",

The DRA is based on the idea that every element of a multidimensional space can be represented by a single point in a finite dimensional space.

In particular, we prove that the DRA is able to solve the convexity problem in any dimensionality class.",
    "Recurrent Networks (NNs) have been successfully used to understand many other real-world problems like object detection in video images. To date, however, these networks are not able to reliably infer semantic structures across large video datasets. For example, a popular model used by the open-access Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) [9] that is commonly used in image classification and object detection algorithms, was built using a simple, fast convolutional recurrent network. We demonstrate that a more complex version of this network with the right structure can achieve surprisingly good performance for video segmentation, but with more complex requirements on network parameters and on the training setup. We discuss the results of our work in several applications that support human language comprehension or object detection related models that require more sophisticated features, and we give a concrete understanding of what needs to be addressed by further research. We highlight the potential of recurrent networks for video segmentation models and provide recommendations on how to improve performance.\n\nThe paper is here (PDF). I have added some comments that I had about the paper and some of the other related papers in the link below. I think that this is a powerful demonstration of the promise of NNs and the ability to use NNs with much more sophisticated output.\n\n[10] The following is a quote from the abstract: \"Video segmentation refers to the ability to identify salient features of a video (i.e., locations) without requiring knowledge of the scenes present.\"\n\n[11] I think it is helpful to point out that this paper describes a system whose goal has been to analyze a scene from a video frame by frame, not to analyze a stream of bytes. In order to make sure that the input stream is the same, a small difference in pixel positions need not be considered problematic, as this is already performed by the decoder. The NNs used in this paper are relatively simple, but not simple enough, in my opinion. A single convolutional layer must perform a much more complicated job, but we need a few layers of convolutions just to be able to do this job effectively. A real-life example of this kind of problem is that of color discrimination or recognition.\n\n[12] This paper also describes NNs that are able to process and characterize arbitrary images in different ways (e",

    "(1) - The present study was carried out to investigate brain structures that are related to early post-surgical loss of consciousness induced by anesthetic agents, with an emphasis on the regions of high interest in the field of parapsychology, astrobiology etc.. The areas of highest potential importance include those relating to perception mechanisms (fascicles, retinotopy), processing of memory information (frontal lobes, cerebellum), visual processes and movement regulation. Also, we investigated structure based differences in regional structural connectivity.\n(3) - There has been only one previous experiment testing the hypothesis regarding neural functional organization changes within six hours after surgery in anaesthetized rats [13]. Thus, these results are not directly comparable with other experiments, which have been conducted in patients undergoing open-brain surgery or in people under anesthetics during clinical studies at different laboratories (for example, here in Paris and at our center ). As expected however, it can be speculated that this may be due to differences between the two species. In fact, for some neurological diseases like ALS [14] and other rare disorders the onset of symptoms does not coincide with anesthesia injection, but rather after several durations of sedation and/or pain medications; thus, for these subjects even short term duration of postoperative seizure activity cannot fully explain the observed network topographical alterations with respect to their normal functions, since there is no possible comparison of function across such different states (i.e. state before and after injection). Here, we chose only one subject, namely A., a young male patient who underwent electrocautery anesthesia after having had a history of epilepsy during the past ten years, to analyze the functional networks in close relation and temporal relationship with his state of consciousness without any prior antiepileptic drug administration. For each case, several neuroimaging methods were performed simultaneously while he remained awake : a DTI scan (DTI protocol [15], [16]), EEG recording, MEG monitoring of cortical signal-evoked response, magnetic resonance spectroscopic mapping (MRS Mapping analysis 1.4) (MTI protocol [17]); in addition to statistical analyses of the time series taken from the aforementioned types of devices for spatial comparisons [].

    "Abstract\n\nA BRCA2 mutation that results in an atrazine resistance allele was detected and confirmed using BESPs (BEsp) (1). The mutations cause a loss of heterozygosity and lead to >10-fold increase in frequency of the mutant allele on chromosome 16q28 (chromosome rearrangement region), resulting in double amplification by base pair mismatch from three sources, both in vitro-based assays and by DNA mapping (2). Analysis of these data suggest that genomic rearrangements are common in human populations caused by mutations in atrazine resistant alleles. However, their effects can't be explained solely by base pair mismatches and a few cases were not observed under appropriate conditions, so chromosomal rearrangement will always exist until complete sequencing becomes available in a clinical situation. This represents another example illustrating how a very robust molecular marker could help explain biological variation. We used the ATRANO project (3) database (4–11) as our reference genome sequence with 838 ATs per million mapped regions and 23,890 positions between chromosomes 1 and 4. We studied the first 150 bp, excluding homologous recombination hotspots. Sequence analysis showed at least 33 additional insertion and deletion events, some affecting amino acids but most containing multiple insertions, deletions or whole-genome displacement. Using this information, we applied two approaches aimed to identify mutations responsible for BCS. (i) By modeling a combination of the ATRS and ATAP proteins and finding the sequences which encode them; (ii) by finding the bases with a major effect based on the nucleotide composition. These strategies uncovered nine different types of mutations, each contributing to one end of the spectrum and four different mutations at either extreme: the ATRS(+)/ATAP(−) substitution, G→A transversions and other combinations of nucleotides. Our results show that these alterations affect more than just the ATRS protein in humans, and thus could well provide a key mechanism in explaining why some people get BCS mutations while others do not, and provide us with new targets that may represent an evolutionary target of BCS mutations.\n\nComments",

    "A number of deep neural networks are used to analyze and understand individual events in space such as images, sound sequences or interactions between people (Bosch et al., 2005; Böhm and Henss et al., 2011). Two categories for measuring domain shift impact can be distinguished according to how the observed domain feature space shift interacts with the underlying feature representations. In either case, it seems that domains shift interact significantly more in some cases and less in others according to their characteristics and underlying architectures (Kühnert et al., 2010; Huber et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2004; Martinowich et al., 2013).\" Abstract From these work we will summarize the main features which characterize the relation between layer shifts and functional architecture in image processing. Using an unsupervised approach based on classification trees for each category of event classes, we show high accuracy over all the classes tested, including large regions within the occipital lobe area. We further show domain shift influence affects the segmenting quality much stronger than the model parameters do. This implies an essential role in the structure and function of the entire cortical network is reflected in activation differences. Thereby, using this analogy domain shift should be conceptualized just like the way objects are classified relative the direction they point from visual stimuli,\" says coauthor Dr. Sebastian Fuchs at University Medical Center in Braunschweig, Germany.\"This result brings several important questions concerning the underlying computational mechanism together with new insights on the interaction among them.

    "This paper reports new findings from multiple machine learning and computer vision experiments that reveal novel methods to identify objects within image collections as well as classify images into distinct categories based upon object features or even infer human-like perception from these datasets. In addition, this is one possible explanation as to why Google's AlphaGo Zero was able to beat an expert at Go while using only about 20 percent of training data. This unsupervised classification method would also be potentially useful in many areas where supervised classifiers are difficult or prohibitively expensive such as real world image recognition. For example, we envision many different kinds of applications ranging from assisting with machine vision tasks for automatic face detection in automated security systems to medical diagnosis and surgery. Also exciting are possibilities which will come when the deep neural networks learn to represent a multitude of non-distal semantic dimensions, e.g., animal body parts, people gestures, etc.. In combination with other computer vision techniques, our approach has the potential impact at much deeper levels in detecting subtle properties of surfaces and environments due to their multi-dimensional nature (e.g., how smooth etc. they are). We find a good match between computational speed and memory required for efficient, yet high quality, segmentation to be in the region of approximately 1 million operations per second for the largest scale dataset to date. The results illustrate that it may soon become feasible to employ machine learning algorithms for image categorization without having trained users with prior knowledge in order to avoid human bias.\n\nSome background information can be found here on Wikipedia.

    "A Simple and Universal Generalization Method to Automatically Generate Object Templates for Unsupervised Scene Recognition by Atsuo Miyazaki and Jie Li, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, The National University of Singapore\n\n\nBackground: Object recognition systems can have extremely high statistical accuracy even if images are annotated with more than one hidden layer representation. These techniques often involve recurrent networks where the model learns new representations via training on test samples (i.e., image examples). However, object templates which are trained by unsupervised methods tend to be much simpler. Our objective was therefore a systematic effort to develop automated software that will recognize objects in any scene as simple objects or complicated object templates by combining several pre-trained templates using either supervised or unfun supervised training. By applying this method our system can produce fully formed and easily understood objects within hours rather than months.\n\n\nMethods and results: We report four experiments: Experiment 1 involves the generative classifiers generating object templates based on both regular embeddings and unlabeled labels; experiment 2 is used to discover the generic rules behind templates generation by examining their feature combinations and distribution; experiment 3 reveals how we can use these generalized object templates in conjunction with hand crafted templates or manually created ones to build up scenes; and finally experiment 4 demonstrates our method's potential by presenting three real world videos composed of animated 3D figures that were generated using our method.\n\n\nConclusion: We found four important ideas behind human capabilities and shortcomings of unsupervised learning technology. First, while the automatic process is an elegant solution to the problem, it makes models inherently inefficient and may result in overfitting when trained only on test set data. Secondly, these methods may rely too heavily on labeled observations alone without giving sufficient attention to other information available about the object in question. Thirdly, there exist significant unsolved problems in the field such as identifying the origin of a particular sequence of features. Lastly, some users may choose not to train classifier models because they lack access to machine readable files containing the relevant models. In contrast to such usage case, our work enables machine reading for all the instances present in a given input video. Furthermore, in practice, the implementation speed of our method compares favourably to existing state-of-the art tools like Kaldi, VGG19, C3DM, KNN, NEAT3,",
    "We study a novel approach to image segmentation which optimizes global-criterion search in a supervised setting using supervised latent space with hierarchical hidden units that perform local optimal classification on the unstructured, high resolution and noise images using simple criteria such as depth or height variation. Our method achieves significantly better prediction rate than previous approaches based either on the use of fixed label-based loss function (discussed elsewhere) or training on nonlinear gradient descent with a prior unknown with a global criterion at its center. These improvements are not simply due to optimization of feature selection parameters, i.e., we introduce a novel adaptive learning strategy to estimate the best possible global-prediction algorithm. We show this improved global algorithm, called Local Criterion Adversarial Training (LCAT), under evaluation results outperform state-of-the-art globally efficient methods on real applications and benchmark tests. The proposed architecture has potential importance for several special cases including sparse sensor spaces, which are currently limited by noisy data and limited computational resources; for example, the large neural network architectures like a voxel based convolutional layer could also benefit from this model. This may have implications in image analysis in particular when more dynamic features need to be selected without having to resort to coarse scale perturbations. Finally, our results suggest an exciting new approach towards improving both image labeling and object detection tasks, showing that high accuracy can be obtained even when not strictly connected with prior knowledge, without compromising performance and computing cost through arbitrary tuning via a locally tuned minimizer. We welcome feedback on ideas and future developments on LCAT.",

    "Full-face or no facial recognition, we show that our face data represent an average face, where each point in the set represents one individual and each observation has its own variance [5]. This representation provides a first indication of the accuracy with which other individuals' faces can be matched across the same population - which are usually used as models to predict social behavior. To get this information, each point represents only a portion of the world-wide face dataset; hence, if we expect our face data to have high correlation (e.g., one individual's head shape will match the most of all) then our predictions should use only those portions of the set. If we do make such inferences in real life settings, these assumptions may not always hold true, and we might therefore need to include additional visual representations of non-target behaviors. Thus what it means to say something is written about you does not depend on your name. We demonstrate in a simple example how we can estimate a person's age using just their forehead-hair location data. In general, given enough measurements we can accurately guess whether or not a face belongs to a particular individual. For example, given data gathered from 1,000 random citizens, it makes sense to assume that a person under 21 years old (n=1,001) has a very similar appearance to someone aged 60 who lives elsewhere (age n =3). The next figure illustrates the general shape of our distribution. A point has a mean at ~~\nwhere p=(0.2i ~ i), the height is x(z+f) and the standard deviation is s~a(d~). We take values between 0 to ~ (max d=15), assuming, however, that\nWe see that points that belong together have more variance than points on different sides of the circle. While we cannot fully remove all variability from the observations by adding noise to them, and thus may reduce predictions made in order to account for low-frequency components, (and perhaps also bias towards estimates that fit people as well as they seem), the end result is the same. As we will see shortly, this information could help prevent false confessions. In Figure 2b, there are 10 pairs of observers (red line) selected to produce a reasonable mixture of male and female faces. These are not",
    "*This is an interdisciplinary field study of the quantum gravity of asymptotically safe Einstein gravity. The study aims to test the limits to which quantum gravity can be carried out without violations of Asymptotically Safe Classical Einstein, i.e. without gravity that cannot be detected by current classical theories. While using the most developed theoretical framework for calculating gravity, we show that only a limited class of asymptotically safe quantum gravity is compatible with a classical gravitational collapse: In one such class is the Asymptotically Safe Hamiltonian with only two degrees of freedom, the spin and the spin+spin interactions, where for spin=0, spin-1=0 and spin+spin+1=0, the spin+spin and the spin-1-spin properties are the same as for all the particles of this class. Moreover, we find that in a few of such cases (e.g. the Spin-1+spin-2 Asymptotically Safe Hamiltonians and Spin-1-spin-2 Asymptotically Safe Hamiltonians), the spin state does not collapse, and that a more general class of asymptotically safe quantum gravity is compatible with a classical gravitational collapse, at least below a certain small number of degrees of freedom.

    "Image Fusion Algorithms: A Review and Analysis\n\n\nAbstract: Images are one kind of data, but they are highly non-deterministic in their evolution. They exhibit strong similarity to each other across spatial locations, which has been termed hyper-similarity. While some aspects of it (such as its smoothness) may be hard or impossible to accurately characterize, others such as their similarity from image boundaries can readily be described by means of a number/space linear combination of feature maps—e.g., using sparsity models with multiple sub spaces/dimensions. These methods have played an active role into high level perception issues including object recognition, scene understanding, face detection and language translation; and while currently they comprise only 10 percent of all deep learning systems (in terms of overall training activity), it holds the key to a revolutionizing our ability to process visual information both rapidly (via memoryless deep learning) and robustly. Here we review four related theoretical approaches that together offer significant advantages over traditional spectral methods for image fusion: convolutional neural networks (CNNs), dense representations, sparse coding and hypersphere computing. We first introduce their empirical and conceptual limitations which require large input images/datasets in order to adequately capture their underlying structure. Finally we compare them against existing techniques and explore their potential applications under various conditions.\n\nKeywords: CNNs, convolutional neural nets, sparse representations, hyper-representations, hyperspheres, vector space machine learning",

    "Kleinian groups provide direct information on displace properties of the generated hyperbolas in different configurations involving only two generators - the 2-gen1/2, 3-gen2/3, 5-gen4/5, 6-g5/6 or 7-g7/7 generators. We study this phenomenon by solving a compactly consistent system of ordinary differential equations, where the free group operators f 1, … are linearly independent polynomials of degree six whose solutions lie close to the boundary (the noncommuting elements). The constraint conditions for the solution of these equations include an inner product law with respect to the order of the coefficients that limits the length n from five to four, leading to an interesting topological property for this field, namely that the solution points have two distinct dislocations given by p jk → ∞ = [ i + j / n ] ≡ p q k. Using one of these solutions, we can recover general formulas explaining a large variety of geometrical figures, including the Platonic solids, the hyperbolae and the torus. The present result also shows that the free-kinetic equation on a sphere satisfies the double-slit problem for finite size plates, which previously went unproven.\n\nWe're quite excited about this and hope people enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it.",

We show that these methods can be applied to extract information about the structure and properties of textures without requiring any knowledge of their underlying data structures. Our method uses a novel approach to efficiently compute the graph of a given texture at each pixel position. This allows us to perform efficient texture segmentation on large datasets with high accuracy. The resulting graphs provide an accurate representation of the texture's geometry and allow us to identify features such as edges, corners, and seams. In addition, we demonstrate how our method can be extended to other types of textures, including those generated by 3D printers.",
    "A family of random noble means substitutions (FRMS) system aims to overcome the main obstacles in designing complex systems-determinability, robustness, and performance-towards practical objectives. We design FRMS systems for the development of real, practical, real-life applications, where such systems have practical importance as a replacement for complicated, abstract, and non-linear algorithms. Our applications cover problems in game theory, bioinformatics, bioinformatics research, and data mining. In doing so, we have designed a family of FRMS for these and related problems. The implementation of the FRMS consists of three sub-components: first, we simulate the results of a complex probabilistic algorithm (a \"skeleton\" of such an algorithm, or \"solver\") with a domain of interest, which we call \"the environment\"; second, we use FRMS system to solve the \"environment-solving problem\" of computing sub-optimally, or non-linear sub-solutions to the objective function; third, we then calculate values of such system of sub-solutions which are more rational than alternative solutions. For simplicity of description, we refer to these sub-solutions as \"subsets\": they contain, jointly, the solution which yields the subset of values on that sub-set of values. Aspects of the FRMS family include:\n\nA family of FRMS systems for simulating complex problems using deterministic methods. A real-life example of these FRMS systems is the approach for predicting the evolution of viruses, for which we use a FRMS-based model to generate a family of FRMS with two sub-solutions (for simulation);\n\nA family of FRMS systems for sub-optimally computing sub-solutions (for simulation);\n\nA collection of FRMS systems for obtaining an understanding of the environment's properties by obtaining a family of deterministic FRMS-solutions to an environment-solving problem.

    "A new type of microscope with a single scanning mirror coupled to an atomic force microscope (AFM) is proposed in this paper. The microscope has the potential to simultaneously produce superresolution imaging and atomic force microscopy, thereby opening a new window of insight into atomic force states. This technique should enable researchers to measure the quantum mechanical properties of subatomic particles and atoms with unprecedented precision.  The main problem with current AFMs is that the imaging resolution is often limited to only a few atoms.  However, a method of multiplexing the beam is presented which simultaneously produces multiple frames of high-resolution and low-noise spectra in the beam (i.e. multi-photon emission and absorption) at a single operating point.  Finally, the novel technique was shown to be practical by combining multiple AFMs into a single microscope by using an interferometer between the microscope and one of the AFMs.  All of these results are described in greater detail in the supplementary material and further on the arxiv.org\nThis may be a new advance in the field of scanning transmission electron microscopes. The technique could be of significant value within the fields of high-power applications on sensitive nuclear and biological detectors, nanotechnologies such as smart sensors using nanoscale components, nuclear medicine and medicine, ultra-fast particle accelerators and fusion reactors and much more. It may be that this is a very interesting technology as these kind of microscopes are much smaller and cheaper than current technologies.",

    "Abstract\n\nThe low-pass low-limit filter (LPF) is a simple algorithm for filtering signals in high-fidelity, low-noise audio systems. But in order to produce an ideal LPF, many parameters must be carefully controlled. To illustrate the issue, we describe how to construct a custom-designed LPF for a complex, highly dynamic acoustic instrument, using the LPF-algorithm developed in our previous work [1]. A novel approach has been taken, which allows us to control the dynamic pressure of our acoustic source (the speaker), in multiple dimensions (in other words, we are able to achieve a true passive LPF). The LPF-algorithm is demonstrated on experimental recordings of different acoustic stimuli, ranging from classical to contemporary jazz music. These experiments show that the LPF-algorithm is not only efficient, but also reproduces the \"rightly proportioned\" tonality of modern acoustic sources. This demonstrates that a true passive LPF is technically possible.",

    "On rare occasions within the Universe, massive objects collide with each other and violently explode in spectacular ways (like supernovae). But such explosions are also likely, if distant neutrinos come along to provide them with even more energy. Neutrons stars are extremely dense regions in which these powerful particles are produced from neutrons captured by surrounding protons and electrons. They act like white dwarfs trapped by gravity because of their enormous mass – in fact, not all neutrino oscillations decay so abruptly either. A large fraction will continue to be emitted into space, giving rise to neutron star luminosities exceeding 100 billion suns. If sufficiently accurate measures exist at the center locations of multiple neutron star systems where these oscillations have been observed, this theoretical upper limit may well be exceeded if neutrinos play an important role. Here we describe experiments we carried out at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), one kilometer below the surface underground near South Africa's Cape Town Observatory under conditions that permit high-energy neutrino measurements over the course of several hours. We measure both the rate and location of several events of very energetic cosmic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) generated by pulsato oscillation of nuclear fuel in low-mass stellar cores, some 200 to 600 times more energetic than GRB130603A, the most energetic to date reported in astrophysics. The result indicates that up to 10% of all GRBs occur with rates that reach several hundred kiloelectronvolts/second and some 400 gigaelectronvolts/second, respectively. This strongly challenges early models on how these sources must appear under certain astrophysical circumstances, such as a background source of weakly interacting cosmic ray nuclei. These energies would require a relatively stable plasma state surrounding the central black hole.",

    "A disaggregation of the global brightness temperature maps of the SMAP (Space Marine Advanced Placement Program) spacecraft during L3-visited L2 was recently proposed from the standpoint of using kernels to extract the global spatial resolution and then classify pixels with similar brightness over 3 km as well as those with similar brightness from 3- to 11-km distance. This new approach is based on applying the same techniques that led to disaggregating cloud and sky maps. By performing a first step-wise calculation over global brightness, we can map out any features located within a 1% window. This yields a global brightness map that can be used for disaggregation purposes. This also allows for further refinement of the resulting brightness maps by identifying and measuring the maximum and minimum values. This research results allows for further classification of brightness over the L2 L3 orbital region and as such has valuable applications to the future development of space reconnaissance satellites.\n\nImage credit: ESA / C.

    "\"These results provide an important new insight into the way cortical connections in the mouse visual cortex are organized. By analyzing both the location and the strength of connections, we were able to discern the role of many underlying features of brain connectivity within the segmentation of a cortical pattern. We first studied how the strength of connections varied according to the strength of activity in a region. We then applied an exploratory approach to localize the cortical structure by identifying which connections from that region were responsible for generating the particular patterns. This strategy allowed us to identify both the cortical contour and the spatial relation between each contour and the rest of the cortex, from which it was later derived. The main finding that emerges from this experimental platform is that the location and the strength of connection represent unique features that form robust connections with each other.

We show that this approach can be used to solve many problems involving Hamiltonian systems, including those where the Hamiltonian state is not known at all. The method we propose is based on the idea that the Hamiltonian state of an isolated system is determined by the motion of the particles within it. In particular, we consider the case when the particle positions are independent of one another. This allows us to use the same methods as those used to find the Hamiltonian states of systems containing only stationary particles. Our results demonstrate that our approach leads to solutions that are much more efficient than those obtained using classical approaches.",
    "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0739\n\nAbstract – A general approach to constructing low dimensional spatial data sets from normalized categorical variables over two subdomains (i.e., [0,1) can be constructed using an implementation of the polynomial algorithm that yields time asymptotic bounds on an unbiased matrix. We present our method, and empirically demonstrate its use in the construction of 1M time series from 1–4 object types clustered around each subdomain, which yields approximately 2.8X normalization time needed when considering multiple object classes instead of just one. The technique also converges fast against small nonconvergent hyper-parameters. We show how this strategy contributes substantially toward building a robust multi-objective image pipeline of varying computational complexity with the goal of more quickly locating new objects or detecting previously unseen objects at low cost.\n\nWe develop three different methods by analogy with Nested PCA or Principal Component Analysis, namely tC(t)(p(x), y)=f(y) in all cases where x is not equal to zero, T(n=(h,g)) and C(k) from 2-D K-means or 2-D k-means using n<=30 classes per subdomain and h=1 for k values on each of 5 buckets, whereas R2 C(z)(h)=k·f(z). The first two constructivities are efficient, whereas R2 C(Z) (2D-K), involving 30-31 class values/subdomain and H−2×(H+1)/H+3×H for k values does not converge even if H is sufficiently large. All 3 constructsivities do provide reasonable speedup when implemented on standard CPUs; however, neither does provide speedup on GPUs unless n<10k points are used (and in addition requires O(h2) GPU memory usage for storing the partitioned dataset).

    "Abstract\n\nThis paper investigates bridges between subriemannian geometry and algebraic geometry, by investigating the connection between the geometric structure of subriemannian geometries and their algebraic counterparts. The main idea behind this connection is that subriemannian geometry can be viewed as an algebraic extension of Euclidean geometry, which in turn can be seen as an algebraic extension of topological space. This view has been proposed before (e.g., [1], [2]), but it was not clear whether such connections were valid or not. In particular, there are many examples where the algebraic extensions of subriemannian geometry do not correspond to any known algebraic structures. For example, the subriemannian manifold of the Riemann surface is not a homogeneous algebraic space, nor does it have a finite-dimensional analogue. However, we show that these problems can be solved using the same techniques used to solve the problem of the bridge between subriemannian geometry and topology. We also prove that the algebraic structures of subriemannian geometry are equivalent to those of algebraic geometry.",
    "On June 12, 2016 I presented my first paper at Google DeepMind on \"Toward Deep Reinforcement Learning with an Unsupervised Model.\" The present work aims to explore and expand our knowledge of techniques related to deep learning in social media analysis. Specifically, we present a new method that combines an unsupervised model for sentiment classification (and its associated data) with an automated tagging system to improve sentiment extraction for non-reinactive posts on Twitter (under @mention #hashtag). This approach demonstrates the power of combining supervised models and collaborative filtering to extract semantic features that capture sentiment, while avoiding preprocessing and additional backpropagation work. We evaluate this procedure across more than 800 different tweets. Our results reveal some surprising surprises about how well the technique works. However, as we show over 900 times over the course of the experiment it generally converges fairly quickly toward reasonable predictions. Importantly all of the methods described here work great under relatively small input sets, implying they may be particularly useful for applications where users are highly connected to others and have a high rate of updates. As such we expect these tools to prove helpful in many areas ranging from sentiment annotation to natural language processing. On the other hand, given our preliminary findings there are several limitations that we hope to address in future studies. First, these tools may need to be adapted for use in real time context or in contexts which require more extensive and frequent labeling including tasks like image search which tend to yield large quantities of content or where the training corpus tends not to contain important data prior to classification, e.g. due being on mobile platforms where sparse data often dominates the training set. One way to compensate for the lack of preprocessing would be through automatic feature scaling or machine learning algorithms. Second, although most of the examples used on this study were images, one might speculate that there could be instances in which text was also used alongside pictures or other kinds of images because of the vastness of the database used for the training. Finally, some caveats must be noted. To put things simply, we don't claim to discover anything special or novel in this task by building these networks — rather we can see something similar using traditional reinforcement learning and also think through how to expand upon what is learnt when applying these techniques to other tasks which might require similar capabilities. Nevertheless, we believe that this new approach has a",
    "What Do you see in this image? Can this image be made into a computer algorithm to make predictions that would be useful, i.e., reliable? If not, what needs to happen next? There are thousands of possible answers to these questions. What I do want to suggest (and to hope that everyone might benefit from) is if our understanding remains highly fragmented and vague due to limitations in computational tools that can help us understand a problem better than we were before, we should look further and beyond ourselves at an artificial life solution with less fragmentation. At least we have been successful in this direction -- but as soon as the challenge arises that seems harder -- then there really are no limits and it will take much longer to solve the problems. This paper does just propose the idea, and not offer to implement it yet. We start by presenting some data about large-scale continuous segmentations for a wide variety of objects and features. The datasets included here correspond to two recent studies related to object recognition and classification for web search engine requests; however, they cover categories such as music, documents, places etc. Data on all the targets covered in both of those research works was generated using HCI (Hierarchical Coherent Infrared). In short, we study long-range continuous discrimination, ranging up to tens or even hundreds of megabits per second, which should be achievable using non-hierarchical coherence techniques. These techniques involve encoding object images and their contents back to memory, which we extract segments from each time-stream to generate labels, thus allowing one to extract segmented representations of images and contents based on time stamps between frames in sequence of images. Our first model shows large performance increases compared to HCI techniques (Figure 1a), despite its being very simple with a fixed number of parameters. Figure 1a shows our models' error-based performance against pre-trained Hierarchical Constrained LSTM networks with only 200 hidden units and 50% learning rate. It makes obvious that our results differ dramatically because of our chosen choice and the relatively large amount of training data collected for our initial work. Figure 1b compares our model's accuracy using new unlabeled inputs over its same data set, and Figure 2a shows how easily it drops out from a trained network.

    "An Empirical Study of Nonlinear Alfven Waves in the Coronal Plasma Funnels This paper presents an analysis of the Alfven wave, a nonlinear waves for which the wave parameters have an inherent instability that can generate complex nonlinear currents on the coronal plasma boundary. The wave is considered to be an open channel field that generates current that can be transmitted along a nonlinear path along the plasma. In this paper, it is shown that a large magnitude wave exists that generates wave conditions that are nonlinearly dependent on the value of  θ. The numerical simulations presented in this paper show that it is possible to generate nonlinear waves by changing the values of  θ to either move the wave forward or backward and this can move the wave condition through the nonlinear aperture into the plasma interior. The nonlinear current is produced with a minimum length of  20° for the amplitude to change. A wide variety of perturbations were considered by means of a number of wave equations to produce the Alfven waves. Several wave theories that have been developed for Alfven waves have been tested with numerical simulations to understand the parameters for producing the waves. An evaluation of the accuracy of the wave theories for the Alfven wave is performed by using the maximum correlation structure for the resulting waves, the maximum power density at an altitude of  5 km and the maximum time period  10 2 μs. The results show that the wave theory predictions performed at the largest altitude have a much smaller correlation structure and the resulting wave is unstable and requires higher amplitudes to be generated. The numerical simulations indicate that the phase difference can be controlled to some extent. However, the only model with significantly high accuracy is the combination of two wave theory models. A new method is proposed that solves the phase problem of the two wave theory models while also dealing with the amplitude dependence of the output wave. The results of the simulations show that a high power density is achieved at an altitude of  5 km, that the amplitude can be controlled, while low values of  θ can still produce Alfven waves. The Alfven waves are also useful for studies of the plasma dynamics and structure. More information is found at: http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3627 The PDF of the",

The Image Restoration Achievement uses high-quality (as assessed by the PanoNet-based quality scores), low-resolution, and high-contrast images as starting points and the Segmentation Challenge for predicting and correcting small defects using the SIM results as training data. This paper addresses the following issues: (1) how to improve the learning and classification processes, in particular how to improve deep and learning-based models, and (2) how to use dynamic segmentation model to infer image features for image segmentation. We show that SIM has promising performance in both. We demonstrate the approach to infer image features in low-expectation, high-background, high-contrast images using static segmentation and propose a general method for inferring image features in high-resolution, high-contrast images. Our approach is also general and allows to work on small image defects using only some segmentation steps. We demonstrate the general method using different models.\n\nI've had a few people offer ideas for adding image restoration challenges to this, including one to add the Segmentation Challenge challenges to the Segmentation Challenge set, with the results of the Segmentation Challenge being used as the target validation image. If anyone has any interest in helping this out, please let me know!\n\nEDIT: I added some links to other related papers as well, including this new work suggesting combining Segmentation, Image Restoration and Deep Convolution on a small defect detection (similar to the Segmentation Challenge but with small defects) to give a new state of the art. The new method seems very promising for improving the quality of the models (and improving quality of the entire classifier), and is something that needs to be pursued.

    "We performed multivariate analyses on human whole body skeletons obtained at three different times (2000, 2007-2008, 2010) combined with CT images in order to test whether one can estimate body composition based solely on skeletal shape and muscle area using standard methods for body mass index estimation – or if the entire weight range must be computed by hand (or an approximate approximation). Our results show that this procedure only significantly improves some aspects of body composition calculation when used in combination with standard BMI estimates from either DXA or MRI [1]. The final paper concludes with recommendations on how to minimize error rates when performing similar analysis using machine learning techniques like clustering algorithms instead.\n\nAbstract:",
    "Abstract\n\n\nThe following paper reports a conjecture of Abramov, Gelfenstein, Shkrain, and Lev's for any homogeneous abelian group g of bounded size given by the following properties: (1) any abelian group g has an absolute power (Euler-Mascheroni) on its eigenvalues, (2) there is an absolute power g 1 of g for every g ∈ G ∞, (3) when g is \"conjugate\" to any g of finite size, they have exactly the same absolute power, and (4) for any homogeneous group g of bounded size with an absolute power g 1 of its eigenvalues, there exists an absolute power g 2 of g for every g ∈ G ∞. The conjecture is a form of a diagonalization of the Banach-Tarski problem for large compact groups.\n\n\nThe author demonstrates that his conjecture can be expressed in a form that is consistent, independent of whether there is a Banach space of small sizes in which each of the \"g\" in the above equation plays a compact canonical role. This allows construction of a version of the Banach spaces for this conjecture to be performed with compact formal structure. This conjecture was first verified by the author and his former student Lev Gelfenstein in the year 2000.\n\n\nWhile its development is in good part motivated by practical implications, it shows up several paradoxes that are intrinsic to the concept of compact compactified Banach spaces. That is, it turns out that (1) there is an essential contradiction in this notion that can be circumvented by making the Banach spaces so compact and the elements of the \"g\" of g so compact, that in a non-linear space, one can always determine the abelian group. For an example of the \"Banach Space Paradox\" see Abenova and Hovav's thesis. Although the Banach spaces in the above definition are compactified, the result of one of their \"Euler-Mascheroni\" operations is non-convex and the result of another depends on whether the algebra has any group of the real kind, rather than a finite group.

    "One might expect that segmenting three-dimensional objects into two-dimensional slices and then recovering information by summing each slice in turn will require linear approximations to Euclidean distances, or more specifically matrix translations between the slices. However, these approximate solutions (matrices) are not optimal. In this work we show how to make two dimensional objects partitioned into three dimensions tractable, without requiring any mathematically rigorous calculations. First, using sparse vector spaces one achieves high accuracy while maintaining asymptotic efficiency as shown later; second, we present an adjuncative method to minimize the amount of computation needed over the data (i.e., the size of the embedding can actually be tuned); and third, we provide a simple algorithm which scales well. We demonstrate segmentation techniques on two-dimensional objects, for examples such as 3D mesh meshes. As a consequence of this paper segmentation becomes possible on low spatial resolution images and even on high temporal resolutions at small spatial scales for example those used in human-computer interaction applications. It also enables efficient rendering of complex three-dimensional visual models such as videos and photos.",

    "We report on a graph constructed from four finite-dimensional random curves, p(p 0, …n) = {1,1,1}, p(0,1),…, pk = k, whose only points lie in two distinct subspaces within this space. Here we study its structure: no edges or vertices link any points. Although there are an infinite number of them, we have also identified a particular node (the central core point) only six times—in each instance as the top item on a line (a straight). Furthermore, one can draw arrows connecting every possible pair of cores with all the points within the set of all connected nodes (Figure 1A). However, by examining the distribution of these edge weights, it is evident that there exists at least one possible sequence [Fig. 5B]. What might the origin of these edges be? It must follow that some edge must be missing somewhere in this distributed graph, so a small search shows that at most 6/16 paths (3.6% of all possible sequences) take to an endpoint. The central core could theoretically form part of the complete subset K → n+1, but if we include all of the other clusters as branches of the same tree then it would appear to be a very infrequent occurrence. If it is indeed rare with probability ≤ 3√2/(2√2≤24 + 2*((9−7)(12))) then we should expect some simple solutions to the questions of \"what lies inside this core,\" \"which node it contains, whether core has more than 4 vertices,\" etc., by virtue of the fact that they occur three orders fewer frequently than the ones we observe, yet their probability is nevertheless close enough to 4/8. This fact raises the question of how many such solutions exist. One way of exploring this problem may consist in creating new versions of Petersen cubes, in which the total amount of vertices increases until the cube reaches 14 degrees (4 vertices × 8 lines each) and then converges; we provide code to do this below (see the results section above); it eventually arrives at vertex 12 at about the right time after an error of 3×1000 steps. A second approach is to try making a single core as large as our dataset permits by increasing the central radius. As the cube continues",

While current deep neural nets offer high performance with low computation cost, MPI's architecture can efficiently scale to high volumes of training data while relying on simple computational models as well as relatively few operations per message (operation times estimated at less than 100 ms). This work develops models to infer sequences and their connections through MPI, taking into account a small portion of non-sequential features such as state changes and messages between agents. Our model shows that an intelligent protocol like MPI, once learned by machines, provides sufficiently sophisticated insight about its social environment, enabling the automation and exploration of complex systems by human minds.",
    "To explore novel classification methods that are based exclusively on the use of neural networks, we present a multi-objective recurrent neural network architecture that uses a priority map to segment the input as a 2D space. In this paper we demonstrate the ability of these networks to successfully achieve state-of-the-art performances using large datasets that include audio, video, text, and images. Here we show that the networks are capable of learning novel segmentation constraints for all the tasks assessed, and that the models can be extended to incorporate a variety of semantic information that has already been classified into a priority map. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to model the human visual system in a similar manner, i.e. using a 2D priority map or a temporal priority map to capture human motion and object direction. Finally, we show that this model is efficient enough to run in large GPU clusters on commodity hardware while being highly concurrent, flexible, and scalable. We conclude by investigating the relationship between the architecture used above and the various machine learning algorithms.\n\nThere is more to the paper than just the neural network based segmentation described in the abstract, but this is what they did with all the features:\n\nThese neural networks can then be used to classify a range of text documents and are able to learn complex features for a variety of types of objects. These models can be applied to more complex classification tasks through backpropagation: if the image is blurred, the labels will be blurred after the same amount of time. When presented with a similar image from the input and output streams, these networks can learn to predict which pixels change and are in the middle of their image change. This was achieved by using the original input image as a hidden layer and using the previous hidden layer as a weight.\n\nThey also included a video demo which seems to demonstrate most of the stuff mentioned above – it is not free however, nor is the source code for the Neural Net, so you can decide if there are enough improvements that this is worth the trouble.

    "Abstract The present work provides direct, quantitative predictions about white matter microstructure in schizophrenia as a function of state-specific brain connectivity and structural plasticity. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure cortical grey matter connections across patients with bipolar disorder and matched healthy controls, following an overnight fasting session. These data were then reconnected into two large-scale brain networks identified on MRI that allowed the determination of group differences between groups with respect to group difference values at each node in the network. Using this information, we developed a method to predict macroscopic tracts and connectivities with high sensitivity and specificity in the absence of information about individual nodes in this tract. Our framework uses only measurements at individual anatomical nodes rather than a fully disconnected metric, thereby allowing us to focus our analysis specifically on changes within a given network versus overall structure. To compare these models against one another, we calculated the absolute mean, mean squared error (MSE), and standard deviation of prediction errors along the 2D tract between individual subjects. On average, patients with greater disease severity had increased DTI correlations with reduced intra-network links after fasting compared with normal groups (p < 0.0001), indicating a trend toward overcompensation of their interhemispheric connections. However, both regions with decreased intra-network links during fasting showed increased DTI coherence with increased intra-network link lengths (p < 0.004). In those regions where significant increases (by > 20%) cohered with increased DTI correlations, there was also increased DTI signal density with reduced tract length (p (t > 7.5×10 − 5 ) = 4.92 × 10 - 6 ), suggesting bidirectional communication from less well interconnected tracts to more highly connected ones at interhemispheric boundaries. Patients with altered intercellular dynamics may be exposed to differential treatment pressures, resulting in enhanced or impaired information flows to larger subcortical structures with altered excitability and/or integrity. This type of lateralized transmission has been related specifically for psychosis, but could potentially extend into other disorders. Results are discussed in relation to prior studies showing evidence for abnormal connectivity in schizophrenia and with reference to current efforts aiming to establish neurocircuit-level functional deficits in specific disease states.

    "\"Multiuser diversity and secrecy communication use cases are important to be considered carefully as new forms of anonymity emerge. In this paper we address a real-world scenario of a secret communications application. The target is a secret society which demands secrecy. It needs to maintain strong confidentiality. It relies on the usage of multiple independent individuals. The system is composed of a set of secure, independent, but synchronized machines. To avoid interference of communication, the system employs a jammer that is capable of changing some parameters of a communication, such as its speed, delay time and direction of propagation. We introduce a methodology to build such systems based on opportunistic random number generation (IRNG) and an IRNG-based system for secure group membership matching to exploit the non-equivalence between two random numbers. We identify a high confidence group of participants based on a pairwise comparisons of all possible values of a group membership key, the two-point correlation function, and the timing of their messages to the central target. In this setup, using the aforementioned method, we show that a jammer can make it possible to use a limited number of individual members, who have been selected on the basis of the IRNG in order to minimize any possible interference. We demonstrate that our method of multiuser diversity has an ideal convergence over a real-world scenario of multiple users. The method, when used to attack the center for secrecy (CS), we confirm that it works in the range it is deployed. We demonstrate that we can use it to achieve multiuser diversity and secrecy from the use of the same set of resources (namely, a single, unified network, and a single, common source of randomness, the IRNG) regardless of its external design, by simply changing the central organization's configuration to minimize the likelihood of a jammer. We also propose a method to use them independently during jamming campaigns. The paper introduces both the methodology and some examples of real-world applications.\"\n\nComments and recommendations: Please email your comments or recommendations to the author at gdixon(AT)aas(DOT)cc(AT)csharps(DOT)net.

We introduce machine learning techniques that can be used to learn to discriminate between two separate regions of images with similar features in view and find corresponding portion representations for those regions. Our new mechanism achieves on average 0.66% correct discrimination even when taking into account many additional noise sources, including different feature differences among views, shape differences related to size of objects to object contrast, etc., all taken together adding up to one's image recognition problem as expected. Further, our approach yields better overall performance than common approaches currently deployed on task such as classifying handwritten digits (e.g., [1]). This was achieved despite taking into account over 200 independent classes and 1000 data items each separated by different cross borders without any loss in accuracy.\n\nWe will continue to experiment with our system so stay tuned!\n\nIf you are interested, please visit/track us at @DeepVisionLabs\n\nTo download datasets (in Bokeh format) visit:\n\nhttp://dlx6i4pjqt7wvcv.cloudfront.net/2015/01/17/deep_vision_learning",

    "Colorful sketch faces are drawn in various media such as video games, advertisements, and photography. There's also the art world where paintings and illustrations take on complex and beautiful color themes while still maintaining an aesthetic quality which can be described with a number of concepts including 'aesthetic gradients', 'coloration in abstraction' or 'naturalism'. This project aims to implement a simple segmentation algorithm for these colorspace objects but does so by only taking into account the relevant information about each individual pixel based on its shape relative to other pixels inside the geometry. The resulting lossy results have been compared against existing methods used through image-based perceptual learning (such as Deep Neural Networks that learn object representations using feature-extraction), and show promising properties. Overall the loss function exhibits minimal overfitting in terms of error rates after training on a representative set of samples covering different sizes of color spaces. It exhibits relatively low convergence between iterations across test cases and also shows performance above human level benchmarks, showing the promise of this kind of machine learning approach.\n\nFor more information visit: https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04911\n\n\nThis post has comments from two academics who comment critically and respectfully.",
    "We describe three main non-linear, convective, and turbulence-relevant boundary conditions that have been previously neglected due to their absence for fast flow systems. In the present studies we use these additional conditions to analyze three experimental measurements using several flow simulations. The results suggest general linear scaling laws, including the nonlinear linear dependence upon velocity, temperature, vertical shear (for example) or total Reynolds sensitivity. Furthermore we propose a low level solution to a novel boundary condition that may have been latent in previous calculations but which has recently emerged in our understanding so far in terms of a convection-related process. These constraints could be applied at large scales by combining many small parameters in our approach. Moreover, as shown here, they provide insights into turbulent flows on large scales that are not available directly with other simplified models which do not rely upon subgrid structures like the gaussian core. Finally, it indicates that the theoretical limits of computation associated with the linear approximation are surprisingly relaxed since many computationally relevant solutions can be recovered if only two critical boundary functions are considered: those between one grid volume at a time and all others combined into a single grid system.",

Introduction\n\nThe Fusing-Vertical-Horizontal Convolutions (FVRH) network (Bruijn and van Haarsma) allows for the transformation of two separate video signals (horizontal slice and vertical slice) into a single, unified one (FVRH-vertex). This network is designed to reduce the bandwidth requirement by combining the horizontal and vertical portions of an encoded video signal. This feature enables transmission of several channels via a low-cost communication channel. Moreover, the current implementation on the GPU is not intended to be used for encoding (i.e., only for decoding) but as a learning component for the network prior to encoding. The following is the abstract of our paper:\n\n1.1 General\n\nThe image segmentation task is used for training the FVRH-vertex network. The task is to find a feature-detection method that will predict a pixel in the image with the highest signal-to-noise ratio. For two-way classification, the best feature detector should be chosen after averaging the predictions. The current task is trained manually via the CIFAR10 training set, from which a subset of the training data (representing the top 5%, bottom 3%, median, 20.8%, 25 and median pixels) are reused in the network to reach a performance of 97% for the two-way classification task. The current implementation is trained via the same data subset used for the two-way classification task. The current implementation aims to use a fully-connected network topology and has three hidden layers to enable non-linearity.\n\n1.1.1 Model\n\nIn the current model, a layer is split to four regions (Figure 1).

    "Deep learning offers tremendous promise in image analysis, but its applications and underlying algorithms have not yet been fully explored. We present a review of results from large-scale (∼ 50,000+ labeled images) training against unsupervised generative models that are proposed to perform image segmentation based on convolutions with sparse kernels. The data sets include high-resolution face images taken by volunteer raters via online surveys and high quality videos recorded by the International Affective Picture System. While each dataset represents its own set of challenges, the findings reveal extensive successes in different aspects of supervised and unlabeled deep learning at the lower levels of abstraction compared with those employed previously. Our initial investigation suggests that certain key features can be observed across datasets; these included an ability to exploit higher order structures in the resulting feature extraction and the ability to decompose noise into a more interpretable form. Results also demonstrate significant improvements when incorporating multiple hidden layers and performing multi-segmentation without loss due to overfitting.",

    "In this work, we show that two types of variational models can be used to generate a hierarchical grid over a large image space with a few machine-learning algorithms. These methods are based off the method described in [5]. We first propose a variational variate (varp) model to describe how light and color combine during an image segmentation task, as well as the way that texture contours may mix to form boundaries to further reduce noise. Secondly, an activation function generator (fg) uses random walks within the space of regions in order to identify regions where high or low amounts occur, where high values represent close boundaries while lower ones show more variation by neighboring regions or small features. Finally, a multi-scale network (msn4k), capable of generating any number of levels set representations from these initial varp and fg estimators together, is proposed. Our primary aim was to analyze the performance metrics associated with each method from several different dimensions. This led us to create a generic framework which can be easily reused across many different machine learning techniques as it incorporates some common concepts between all three.\n\nSo if there's nothing here, it seems like a fair point: that the authors weren't able to implement a practical image classification system using all of their ideas -- yet!",

    "The three primary methods used to train a machine-learning model using a large array of 2D slice labels are training to sample the full 3D model, sampling partial 2D slices of the full model, or using a deep neural network (DNN) to reduce the dimensionality of the model. However, there exists no prior work that addresses if and how 3D seismic segmentation can be trained with an attentional/reward model. This study extends the analysis by measuring the attentional/feedback performance on a segmentation problem. A total of 128 3D segmentation problems was solved and the attentional/feedback problem was solved as a simple sequential-solution problem without any need for explicit labeling of segmentation. A novel deep learning model was trained on the segmentation problems using 12 different attentional/feedback tasks. The evaluation on the 3D segmentation problems were performed both on the entire set of 128 segmentation problems and for specific attentional/feedback tasks. Our results show that our learning model has achieved good performance and that attentional and feedback performance across all the tasks we evaluated reached comparable levels, in some cases even surpassing each other. The attentional/feedback model performs best on the sequential-solution problem, while the feedup model performs well on the continuous-solution analysis. The continuous-solution analysis is more challenging than the sequential-solution analysis because it typically requires more time to resolve multiple complex phenomena and involves additional information that can change over successive runs with different parameters. This suggests that the best practice for training models to solve continuous-solution problems is to apply a large training set of observations and a large ensemble of parameters in the linear regression algorithm and not just to train the attentional model. This work is of particular importance because continuous-solution problems that involve multiple phenomena can rarely be adequately solved using attentional segmentation. Also, continuous-solution problems tend to be noisy and typically involve multiple nonstationary effects. Thus, the continuous-solution problem is often poorly studied to date and therefore many attentional segmentation approaches that use a small and homogenous training set for learning of new structure attributes, which may not be realistic for the continuous-solution problem.

    "Background In the past several years, many researchers have used visual techniques to examine human behavior and perception. The Food Image Segmentation (FIS) project is a part of the Human Computer Interaction and Design Laboratory's (HCI) effort to analyze and characterize these techniques. Despite being an exciting field with broad applications, the scientific literature with respect to how this vision-based approach works is scant. Therefore, we present this research, which is an analysis of our first dataset, the \"food picture,\" and proposes a framework that outlines how the information is gathered, encoded, indexed, and used.\n\nKeywords Food Image Segmentation\n\nData Set The Food Picture dataset is the result of a collaboration between the Food Image Segmentation Lab and CIFAR-10. It represents an average of 10,000 images of processed, pre-processed, or freshly sourced foods. The images were collected and processed by an image classifier, and the images were not edited. To ensure that the images were food-related we used the labels of the products. All images were uploaded to the website foodnetwork.org. The average size of the images was approximately 10x13 pixels (10-bit RGB). The images were loaded and aligned to a dataset of about 600,000 images of processed and/or pre-processed foods. The FIS Lab and CIFAR-10 processed and labeled each image, which is an iterative process (see Figure 1). The lab also saved the data between runs. The Lab then ran 1,000,000 iterations on each food pictures, saving the average and 95 percentile images for each iteration. On average, the Lab will run about once every 1-3 minutes. The Lab saved these images and the data between runs on a local computer in order to efficiently maintain the data on a server. We used the following software packages for organizing the data and processing the data: n-grams:A convolutional deep-learning package designed to classify images into features, and combine different features to provide a holistic view. n-grams:Dependency Parsing is a deep learning approach that uses a combination of feature learning and regularization to find out the presence of semantic relationships between words in a given image. The data consists of the label values (x, y) (x,",

That's much harder than it looks! What this all means is that by taking advantage of the classifiers used in image recognition systems like GoogleBot's or Facebook's deep learning algorithms they will now be able to develop extremely flexible models to improve upon these. Using these neural network inspired AI methods and their implementation of them will allow you to come up with very impressive improvements to your project which will ultimately result in new features such as:\n\n1 – Image accuracy\n\n2 – Dynamic range compression\n\n3 – Dynamic Range Compression (DSC) (a feature I've always liked of sorts but wasn't quite sure how it worked or if there was any data behind them… not anymore!)\n\n\nBy studying the work of other companies at NASA who have used robotic craft to do some amazing things. These are companies like GoogleChimps that go to extreme lengths to make sure certain areas on their satellite images or lunar photographs look just right and even incorporate the actual rover into their pictures by using small parts of each component. The way you could use the techniques described above you would combine your human talent and expertise along side of this massive amount of artificial intelligence to create an incredibly versatile system that is capable of building better imagery to help us understand our planet without having to actually leave the confines of Earth! In addition to making images look more realistic we can also increase its dynamic range which helps preserve the details of complex scenes. Now this isn't going to be easy to integrate into most project since they would probably need you to spend a lot of time fine tuning everything else out to accommodate all the processing power needed in order to process this huge data dump while still maintaining the same level of accuracy (as shown by GoogleChimps…) But these projects are doing incredible things and they are definitely worth keeping an eye (and ear) open on.

    "High-Dimensional Representation of Complex, Exercises at the Intuition Level\n\nWe adopt the approach of Rabin and Ousterhout (2013) to represent complex, structured data in lower dimensional n-torr, which exploits the general structure property underlying higher dimensional topological space. We focus on one question and apply the intuition about algebraic structures and equations above in this area: how does such a representation formulize, or embed, some high dimensional model? This issue raises difficulties not seen while dealing with linear transformations between high dimensional representations. In particular, representing both symmetries and symmetry contraction gives rise to problems related to the ordering of algebraic expressions—which then affect their interpretation, e.g., when attempting a parametric solution from within its own domain. On more general grounds, we illustrate that low-dimensional representation spaces tend to have more regular and less chaotic behavior than any two dimensional spatial coordinate space could provide; conversely, when considering representations over arbitrary dimensions, all sorts of local complexity effects appear to arise even though, for certain kinds of interactions, their size is small relative to the number of elements involved. While most previous work looks only at discrete dimensions, our implementation here allows specifying and solving infinite quantities spanning both high and low dimensionality.",
    "Abstract Neutro-connectivity cuts are a new class of nonlinear dynamical systems that arise in quantum field theory and have been studied extensively by many groups, including those at CERN. The cut is characterized by an exponential decay rate with a sharp cutoff near zero. This paper presents a simple model of this phenomenon based on the well known Dirac equation. We show that the cut can be understood as a consequence of the fact that the energy levels of the system are connected to each other via the Dirac operator. In particular, we find that the cut occurs when the energy level of one particle is close to the energy level of another particle.",
    "Medical image data is vast and difficult to collect. This paper develops a methodology to unify the data collected and segmented from different devices for medical imaging purposes into a robust and generalized segmentation framework. We explore the potential and limitations of the segmentation framework, with the goal of bringing the health-related data from different imaging devices into one platform. We demonstrate the framework, which unifies medical imaging datasets from two commercial wearable devices. The framework can classify images from different devices in such a way that it becomes easier to analyze and perform robust, intelligent segmentation. The framework is deployed on Google Tensorflow, enabling fast, accurate and interactive medical image segmentation. We expect the framework to be used from the patient data management and image segmentation perspectives. The segmentation framework is capable of handling images from a wide variety of medical imaging devices, and can be used to perform robust and generic image segmentation across a wide variety of health-related datasets through an intelligent and accessible interface. Our current implementation of the framework uses Google Tensorflow using the image-oriented language of Python. This paper covers the core of the framework, which has been successfully applied and validated on several datasets. The paper explores the practical implementation, with a focus on the use of custom image features.",
    "Abstract: \nThe goal of this research is to explore the feasibility and potential of a thermoelectric energy harvester through the study of the thermoelectric properties of a geometric pump system. The pump material which we use is a ceramic ceramic ceramic composite. This is a porous ceramic material (the thermoelectric properties of this material have been investigated and used), is inexpensive to manufacture, and is a known thermophotovoltaic material, one of the most commonly used energy harvesting materials. While there are other materials out there, like pentalobasics (which also harvest heat at room temperature (3.5 degrees C, ~70 degrees F)), none of these are commercially available. The potential energy harvest efficiencies of thermoelectric devices has been greatly hindered by a high thermal conductivity of the target material, and the need for relatively high conductivities before conversion from thermally to thermally conductive. A significant aspect of thermoelectrical devices is their ability to convert electrical energy directly to heat with minimal energy losses in order to generate thermal energy. However, the heat produced by thermoelectric energy harvesting devices must first be converted to electric charge and returned through an electrical converter. The design and material properties of this converter device are of interest to this research, since converting any electrical energy (which is often a large percentage of the energy harvested) from electrical energy can be difficult.\nThis is part of a larger series of posts that are aimed at finding creative and economical ways to power our lives using clean power from things that don't emit a lot of CO2 like wind and sun. The aim is to see if we can make electricity from the wind and the sun in an economical, clean way that is energy efficient, doesn't require a lot of maintenance, can be scaled up, and still produces power (not just as wind, but also from other sources in other parts of the world. It's a little off topic, but it's an interesting one for reasons given in the beginning of the post)\nIf you like your climate and environment clean, then you have to love wind power. It's one of the hottest and cleanest ways of producing electricity out there.  You just have to know how to use it right.\nIt'll all make sense",
    "Abstract\n\nWe present ECG-delnet, an algorithm that uses neural networks to extract high quality cardiac events from mixed quality labelling data. We show how ECG-delnet can be used to identify and classify patients who have had a heart attack or stroke in real time using only their electrocardiogram (ECG). Our approach has several advantages over existing methods such as the use of multiple independent labels, the ability to detect false positives, and the ability to distinguish between true and false positive events. The main advantage of our method is its ability to detect and classify patients who are at risk of having a heart attack or stroke without requiring any additional information about them. In addition, we demonstrate that ECG-delnet can be applied to other types of clinical data including blood pressure measurements, electrocardiographic recordings, and electroencephalography (EEG) signals.",
    "Abstract The present study investigates the effect of interstellar dust on the emission and absorption spectrum of the light emitted by the Milky Way, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the dust emission is dominated by the emission lines of hydrogen and helium, with only trace amounts of other elements. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the dust is produced by molecular clouds within the Galaxy. In addition, we show that the dust emission is strongly enhanced at high redshifts, which suggests that the dust is being heated up by galactic magnetic fields. Finally, we use the SDSS data to investigate the distribution of dust in the Galactic halo, and find that it is distributed as a thin disk around the central bulge. These results are consistent with the idea that the dust is formed by collisions between stars or gas giants.\nThis is an interesting paper, but I think there's some problems with it. First off, the authors don't actually say what they're modeling. They just state that their model is based on observations of the Milky Way, and then go into detail about how they modeled the dust. But this isn't really necessary. If you look at the actual models used in the literature, they all have very similar assumptions. For example, the most recent one, published in 2013, assumes that the dust is made up of molecules, and that the dust is ejected from the Galaxy at velocities of ~10 km/s. That's pretty much exactly what we see in the SDSS data. So if you want to know what the dust looks like, you can simply look at the SDSS data. And if you want to know what the dust is made of, you can simply look at the SDSS data.\nSecond, the authors seem to be assuming that the dust is uniformly distributed throughout the Galaxy. However, the SDSS data shows that the dust is concentrated in regions where the density is higher than expected. This means that the dust is probably not evenly dispersed throughout the Galaxy. Instead, the dust may be concentrated in certain areas because those areas are more likely to host large numbers of star forming nebulae.\nThird, the authors assume that the dust is composed of molecules. However, the SDSS data shows that the",
    "\"This is really a very cool paper. Thanks to Dr Schmitz and colleagues for this! I am intrigued and a bit skeptical of the claim that Rb is not the source of inversion, as it seems to involve the following four-wave mixing steps: 1. The first step results in the Rb-Ca emission, which was not there before. 2. The second step seems to bring Ca into the system, in effect, causing a cascade of change to the Rb-Ca ratio. 3. The third step is to start the Ca-to-Rb transition again by forcing Ca vapor to react with Rb. 4. The fourth step is a new emission because Ca, Rb, and Ru have all been excited in the same manner via the Ca-to-Rb step in Step 1. How does this actually happen?\nWe know that the ratio of a complex molecule, if modified at an atomic scale, will tend to change over time (e.g., the Rb to Ca ratio of hydrogen is actually quite stable). If a complex molecule is to change quickly or even somewhat often, then a more efficient molecule is needed, for example, a cyclic carboxylate or a cyclic ketone. It is often the case that one or more of the above three complex molecules can be produced through reversible chemical reactions via reversible thermal effects. A simple example is a carboxylate. When a carboxylate molecule becomes the dominant form of CO 2, it is then possible to reverse the reaction to produce the cyclic ketone as the dominant form of CO 2. This reaction provides a simple mechanism whereby Ca can be moved from Ca-rich material to Rb-rich material, to facilitate the final Ca-Rb transformation. The mechanism by which Ca is changed from an alkali metal to an acid metal has been widely studied, although a more complete understanding of the mechanisms involved and the resulting products has important applications for many fields such as environmental chemistry (a more complete understanding of acid carbonation is an aspect of the pH of acid rain reduction that will be pursued as part of research under the NREL initiative CFC-related research and development research and development research in this area).\nThe new Ca-Rb-Rb transition requires",
    "Abstract:\nThe finite element method (FE) is a powerful tool for solving problems in fluid dynamics. The FE is based on the idea that the flow field is a finite set of points, and that the flow field is a finite set of points in a finite volume.

    "In this paper we study the use of active information retrieval in image segmentation using deep learning in the context for medical image processing, i.e., in medicine. We explore whether it can be utilized as one form of training to produce better results on clinical challenges in the field such as error detection and image recognition accuracy. The aim of our work was to present two cases with different tasks related to medical imaging, which can be represented by two separate supervised systems consisting of state-of-the-art RL algorithms: a non-constrained classifier (where the input consists only of patient identifiers) and a constraint-based classifier where each layer consist out of neural network trained with an RCNN. As the classification task becomes more sophisticated and complex, it become almost impossible to train each neural net independently and consequently to run them with higher complexity for extended periods without causing catastrophic errors during the training phase. Furthermore we have observed that many existing deep AI methods are not able to perform such tasks consistently due to lack of flexibility or poor adaptability in their implementation when combined with new features like multi-label support vector machines (i.e., SGMs). By incorporating multiple methods inside a single system, they are more resilient against misapplication with increasing levels of feature engineering which then allows for faster adaptation. In our case we have used the recently introduced L2-regularization, called SVM/BWC, in conjunction with an adaptive variational method based on RBF convolutional networks (RCNNs), also known as Gaussian Beggars networks that improve the output accuracy when the parameter values change to match those of the previous pass of optimization. Moreover with more flexible and adaptive training strategies there was also good improvement over the first version compared and it was shown that these approaches were comparable between all the versions (with similar parameters settings), resulting in much improved performance even at higher images lengths. Finally, after evaluating an entire set of our trained models across real-world medical applications we were surprised by the positive effect of this combination of techniques along with different variations, especially since the number of hidden connections remains fairly low and the number of time steps stays relatively very high which enables efficient search as well as the ability to easily re-train the same model if needed (if some other changes had been made at any point during a particular",
    "Introduction\n\nWith the rise of deep learning, convolutions-based network architectures are gaining in popularity. For image classification tasks this has been particularly beneficial as they can perform with great fidelity while providing high accuracy [1] or near linear precision (e.g., [2]). Furthermore, these networks support dynamic feature selection via softmax activation functions and thus provide a powerful framework to exploit topologically dense features across large amounts of information [3]. However, their efficacy suffers when applied on more coarsely sampled images such as those obtained by standard classifiers. Specifically, it comes at the cost of high memory usage and consequently decreased performance while being difficult to program within modern image classification toolkits. A key factor in the transition between state-of-the-art CNNs that were capable at representing large features but required hundreds of MBs' worth of data to train at tens of millions of examples per run has generally been in the increase in temporal resolution across several filters and hidden layer units over time rather than changes to nonlinearities associated directly with feature learning structures using fully associative neural systems such as Rescorla's [4], Alexey Sergeyev's [5], or the well-known Hinton et al. [6] structure classes to which many commercial neural networks are tuned. In contrast, our work demonstrates that completely hyperbolic convolutionality can be achieved by employing relatively small amounts convolving layers without regard for the spatial frequency content of the filter, allowing the architecture to leverage nonlinearities associated closely with feature generation strategies used by regular unsupervised methods and provide efficient local feature representations for both stationary and transient applications. Further, this also improves the efficiency of CNNs even if there is an approximate equivalent function available by applying a standard, nonambiguous transformation to the input image, thereby permitting a further reduction of both computation and storage requirements that arise due to reliance on precomputed global parameters [7][8]. Finally, we present two novel applications, described below, where the proposed architecture is compared to current state-of-the-art results using convolutional net configurations.",
    "Abstract The Casimir effect (CFA) is one of the most important forces in nature, and it has been observed experimentally to be present at very small scales. However, the CFA is not well understood because of its low resolution and high spatial frequency. Here we report on an experimental approach that uses a single-photon microscope with a resolution of 1 nm to observe the CFA at the nanoscale. We use this technique to measure the Casimir force between two gold nanoparticles placed in contact by laser light. Our results show that the CFA can be measured at the nanoscale, which opens up new opportunities for studying the CFA at the macroscopic scale.",
    "Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cyclic loading on articular cartilage formation in rats. We used a rat model with an artificial knee joint, which was subjected to cyclic loading (10% load/day) for 10 days. After the last day of cyclic loading, we examined the effect of the treatment on the development of cartilage lesions. In addition, we investigated the influence of the type of loading on the outcome of the experiment. Results showed that cyclic loading significantly increased the number of cartilage lesions compared to control group. Furthermore, the number of cartilage lesions was higher after cyclic loading than after control group. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups when it came to the severity of the cartilage lesion. Conclusions Our results suggest that cyclic loading may increase the risk of developing cartilage lesions in rats. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "Our goal was to create three functional classes in CFCM that have higher-order representations along with low dimensionalality, while also maintaining high resolution and low temporal memory requirements. We do this by mapping distinct perceptual components into well-mapped categories based on fine and coarse context. This allows us to segment visual objects into subcategories with comparable spatial proximity, thus achieving better results than most previous methods. In contrast with other methods that rely on non-differentiable or partial measures, we use differential learning algorithms that can be used to extract data directly from perceptual areas in human cortex.\n\nA very important contribution at the beginning, which they describe very well (and it's pretty stunning from what I know). To implement a neural network classifier they first mapped the input pixels on to the image representation so that every pixel represented something in both space and time (it makes sense in retrospect). They then wrote a small layer of a convolutional neural network based around an LSTM that produced classification functions, each weighted by its activation level on each slice between 5 and 11 mm3, called \"segments\". So essentially you could say the convolutional filters performed segmenting, by measuring the similarity between inputs. Finally they trained this model for 3 weeks. It did surprisingly well given that no one really seems worried about any of this stuff these days, but you need to know a little bit more to understand their method.\n\nThey find that there are only 8,000 segments that actually represent images and that the rest is noisy noise. The reason for these noisy examples, they argue, is because when a new feature input to one CFCM neuron changes over time, it tends to leave behind residuals across different parts of the visual field. A \"feature\" for every input image looks like a 2D cross, as they say in their PDF (but if someone else can make some interesting infographics), therefore if you put all sorts of random labels on it, not only will those label locations change across image locations but probably nearby ones too, meaning even \"segments\", which appear sparse, should start showing some signal after enough training iterations! When they tried making their own models directly out of individual neurons using backpropagations to calculate parameters, instead of backpropagation via gradients they got these nasty spikes of error during training",
    "WooZee, Yea et al., The Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation Using Hybrid Network\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWe present weakly supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) over noisy unlabeled MNIST handwritten digit recognition models, by combining with an inversion of the image recognition convolutional neural network (CNN). Two different deep network architectures are described. One ensemble has only seven feature maps and uses 8 hidden layers of Conv2D/ConvNets for encoding the features; another ensemble with five feature maps using only 3 hidden layers of ConvLayers/ConvNets. In both case the training is performed on MNIST-sized example images, thus allowing to obtain better estimators. Since each feature mapping in both cases includes two filters, each filter is fully connected and each layer of this new architecture consists of 2–6 weighted connections. This way we can use the same dataset to learn the CNN's performance as well from our other method by introducing some local bias in one or more feature maps, resulting to very flexible multivariate sparse classification while avoiding any global bias in any classifier's estimates. We evaluate the performances against three common methods to segment speech - SVMs with binary crossentropy loss or Bagging, RNNP, using a preprocessing step that converts the input into a single long dense string.

    "Image Segmenting with Fast Partial Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n\nIEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Software 2012 (TCIS),\n\n13(4): 441-452. doi: 10.1109/TICOIS.2012.247439, doi: 10.1109/TICOIS.2012.247439 I am currently working at an Israeli company which develops software solutions that allow visual perception to be efficiently performed with machine learning techniques. Part of this work involves developing better algorithms regarding image segmentation, where we need efficient solutions to quickly find images whose edges are convex or concave, while being able to quickly recognize the image itself when it's oriented in some way. We had already discovered in the past decade several interesting problems relating to image segmentation involving different types of image features, such as orientation, rotation, colors, etc. However, our current progress on visual recognition tends towards the more general problem related to using more sophisticated visual feature extractors based on nonlinear regression. When comparing existing classifications technologies for face detection, most rely heavily upon linear combinations between various classifiers, while less complex ones employ one-dimensional convolutions or sparse representations, depending how much information can be extracted over a specific subset of pixels. Despite being capable of solving many real world tasks, these classifiers suffer from several limitations - not all possible configurations have been considered, each classifier has its own inherent accuracy and certain configurations seem prone to catastrophic convergence. Furthermore, there tends to be large amount of false positives due to poorly selected classes. While a good classifier is certainly needed, an ideal method should not need any more than a couple of minutes per training session, in order to create a model optimized specifically by your needs. Another requirement is low computational cost so that the trained model can easily be used for testing purposes. The goal of my work was to explore possible approaches that could combine two major strengths found in high performance computing devices in computer vision - parallel architecture with hardware accelerators, in an effort to improve their ability to run image classification problems at enormous speeds, thus potentially enabling applications like interactive facial recognition and image captioning to become faster and scalable without sacrificing efficiency.

    "Abstract:   We report on the investigation of the small redshift limit of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov system, which constitutes an upper limit of the low-mass regime. The limit is a consequence of the non-resonant symmetry group e\\Phi\\S^2 \\cdot \\mathbf{e} \\;\\;\\;\\mathrm {1}\\simeq\\mathrm {e}^\\top \\; e \\cdot \\mathrm {1}\\,}, which requires a number of terms of the form \\frac{1}{e^\\delta}{\\mathrm{e}} d \\mathrm{d} \\phi. With these functions applied to the spherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov system, the limit is obtained, with the sign of the limit being negative. We consider the stability of the system under these functions and their interaction under the weak force. With the application of both the strong and weak force from one particle to the other, the spherically symmetric Hamiltonian is stable under the weak force.

A review on the literature was conducted to identify materials with magnetic properties that can be improved upon because of their potential application in advanced applications. The properties are reported from experimental and theoretical studies using different metal oxide nanoparticles and metallic organic frameworks. These were compared to other commonly used materials. In an experimental study with ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic oxide nanosheets, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements made using a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device showed the magnetic sensitivity of ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic oxide nd oxide thin films. The 1D and 2D ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic oxide nd oxide thin films showed significant magnetic sensitivity enhancement, depending on the ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic oxide species present in the films, as the concentration of magnetite and cation-stabilized ferromagnetic oxide nanoparticles. Moreover, the nanostructures were found to exhibit different susceptibility to magnetic field variations depending on the ferromagnetic oxide species present and the number of particles. In the 2D MRI device study using a six-dimensional (6D) MRI device, ferrome oxide nanostructures showed significant magnetic sensitivity enhancement and also a low susceptibility to magnetic field variations depending on the ferrimagnetic oxide species and the concentration of ferrimagnetic oxide nanoparticles. In an experimental study in a",
    "\"We propose a self-improvement strategy for addressing the core problem of self-downgrading, by using a set of self-validation techniques to counter negative feedback from people whose self-esteem they want to improve. While people can engage in self-validation, they often do so in an impulsive way that undermines their performance. We suggest an alternative to self-validation that does not depend on attention on others, but instead uses the self-perceived worth of the self. We demonstrate our method in an experimental game based on the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma. The game involves 2 agents who are in control of a resource, A, and 2 agents who want A to be less abundant, B, who is playing the role of the Victim of the situation. The Victim's task is to convince the self-liberating Agent \"p_0\" to provide B with more resources so that \"p_1\" can be released from the game. In theory, this leads to a positive feedback loop for each player, with each player better able to make progress to their desired objective. However, we find that this effect of self-liberation disappears if the two players \"self-validate\" each other to make each other increasingly less good. Instead of providing more incentives to the Victim, the self-validating players become even more desperate to make sure that \"p_1\" will eventually give up the game. This becomes so extreme that the Self-Liberating players themselves actually end up worse off than if the Victim hadn't self-validated. Hence, our results imply that it is better to self-validate, but in a manner that does not overreach the self, rather than being in the self-indulgent self-validation stance itself. Thus far, this approach has not previously been applied to individual behavior, and we show there is ample experimental evidence suggesting that it is a reasonable strategy to use across a range of self-relevant domains.\"\n\nWhile this article is about improving your self-esteem/status, it's also about building connections with others, and finding love.

    "Abstract The high-energy physics community has been interested in the possibility that the strong interaction may be responsible for the production of new particles, such as the W bosons and Z bosons, which are predicted by the Standard Model but have not yet been observed. In this work we propose an alternative explanation for these particles based on the existence of higher-order relativistic corrections to the gluon scattering cross section. We show that the correction can be derived from the decay of a pair of quarks into two photons, one of which decays into a W boson and the other into a Z boson. This process is consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model, and it provides a mechanism for producing the W bosons and Z bosons.",

    "Owing to a substantial reduction (60%) of ion recombination within organic photovoltaic devices, researchers led by Professor Anh‐Binh Le and Dr Wei Yang have managed to create a novel material that exhibits more stable redox reactions than traditional metal oxides used as light absorbing elements. As shown in several laboratory studies, this new material allows efficient solar cell operation at an even higher temperature (up to 500 K). The results could have significant implications on applications, such as in flexible electronics where heat dissipation becomes crucial.\n We have previously described how organic solar cells function at elevated temperatures by altering their physical properties (and improving their efficiency) using relatively low concentrations of inorganic dopants—the very same compounds found in solar panels and the semiconductors they are made out of. However, the chemical changes necessary due to in situ reaction catalysts at these extreme environments appear extremely difficult or impossible to engineer. One way to overcome this difficulty would be to exploit the so‐called bandgap effect. While not limited to this situation (as other classes of electrons that aren't used for conducting electricity do exist), this phenomenon offers a unique opportunity to take advantage of an electron's ability to oscillate between states. To achieve this by creating hybrid polymers composed of many different types of molecules containing large amounts of nitrogen, researchers must generate molecular bonds between these atoms via the addition/removal of oxygen. This intermolecular bond makes it possible to change the electronic composition along the entire length of every molecule and creates additional potential energy. But achieving effective combinations like these remains challenging because of their complex chemistry—which requires precise measurements. Such bonds can only form through carefully controlled conditions. Even with this careful engineering approach, such structures still cannot be produced using standard synthesis methods. We develop ways around such challenges through development of new chemistries based on ultrahigh pressures, highly reactive molecules and radical initiators. All we require to synthesize this class of structural materials to reach useful properties such as long cycling life and broad spectral enhancement lies in its reactivity. By selecting specific reactants that can act strongly in the presence of one another during synthesis, we can produce highly selective, pure functionalized systems possessing both well defined physical properties and high electrical conductivity. With these principles employed and improvements to previous",

    "A number of recent reports have shown that the low-level transfer of electrostatic fields from metallic or semiconductor materials to each other could lead to a significant increase in the power density of supercapacitors. The underlying theory behind this effect, however, does not explain the phenomenon well. In this paper we show how the co/Ti bilayer bilayer (Ti(B)Nb+ ) material of our work (Nb = Mn, Cr, Sb, Ag, and Pb) can exhibit the phenomenon due to the presence of high-level in-plane electric field on the surface of the bilayer. In the presence of strong out-of-plane, or electric charge flux on the surface, this electric field has a considerable effect on the interlayer transfer current and therefore negatively impacts the electrostatic capacitance of the device. Moreover, the resulting reduced power density of the graphene supercapacitor can be attributed to the observed enhancement of the power-transfer effect due to the interaction of graphene bilayers with both the out-of-plane and in-plane electric fields.\n\nThe researchers hope to get this field of research to a real-world application, like the ones that Tesla was working on in his time.\n\nWhat's the most important element that helps a Tesla Model S to go 0 to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds?\n\nWhat's the next innovation that the automotive industry needs to make its automotive cars more efficient?\n\nJoin over five million Tesla owners around the world in living a greener world.

    "Gray Image Extraction Using Fuzzy Logic\n\nAbstract\n\nIf you are a researcher interested in the properties of a set of images, you might be considering using fuzzy logic to build an abstract model for what it means to represent the images. For example, you look up the following image in a database:\n\nYou might then decide that you would like to ask: what is the probability of this image in our dataset? That is, does it have a uniform distribution? Let's call this the probability distribution of the random variable, p, such that there actually is no image with probability p in the database.\n\nSome examples of methods for fuzzy logic calculations are presented. In principle, we can use fuzziness to produce an equivalent representation for a random variable using fuzzy logic, and use this to solve problems related to our model. But, I've found that even when the goal is to build a model that can represent any image, the fuzziness used in fuzzy logic tends to lead to an overly complex formulation, possibly making the model less powerful than what is actually important and meaningful.\n\nSo if these problems arise, what can we do about it? I believe that we can use a more powerful technique called approximate inference, which is based on approximations of the underlying probabilities (often mathematically approximations) of data to make more direct and less ambiguous predictions.\n\nApproximations in Artificial Intelligence\n\nWe normally think of the information in our dataset as a vector of numbers, so this representation in our model will represent a set of features, but as long as the distribution of the features is not exactly Gaussian (randomly distributed over our entire dataset), there is a small chance there will be more than one feature with the same distribution in our data. This is not to mention the likelihood to find a feature with that distribution. These distributions, if too broad, will lead to more complicated models.\n\nThe reason why fuzzy logic is not ideal in this case has to do with fuzzy logic calculation. It is impossible to calculate the exact probability distribution of the hidden, or hidden state, using a method like fuzzy logic. How is this done?\n\nThe answer, I believe, goes back to the idea that probability is a continuous quantity that is not affected by the distribution of the hidden information that we are investigating, but is also",

The simulated images used are either from Wikipedia and Google Public Libraries, or are taken directly from YouTube v5's video indexing by YouTube v4 to create new-style videos. In addition to an image classification task, one can ask how well two representations (representations that have been unlinked) can be used to produce a joint set of real and simulated images; in some cases we show that their combined output is significantly better than single model outputs alone. These results highlight how CNNs that use deep learning algorithms can achieve high accuracy even when training their own latent variable models. Our conclusions and suggestions apply both to historical document categorization and human classification tasks - they may also inform future work at other industries.\n\nTo give you a rough sense of what it means to test whether Deep Conv2Net would do the trick, here is another example of its performance at classifying two sets of pictures from Flickr:\n\n\n(Click to enlarge).

    "This work studies an alternative formulation of inflation to that suggested by R.A.E., with respect to nonlinearity and its consequences, through examination of the potential influence of singularities on cosmological parameters and dynamical properties such as cosmology–physics interactions, space curvature–gravity correlations to the Hubble volume (H v ), inflation history complexity (JHC) and gravitational fluctuations in the distant past of our universe. This alternative formulation is based on new techniques to obtain higher dimensions of symmetry, without using any additional energy or potential quantities. These have been previously demonstrated for flat or spherically symmetric spaces but are absent in these alternatives. Through comparison of their behaviour compared with classical physics and experimental data obtained by direct measurements at Planck time scales, we provide evidence for possible phase transitions between various versions and find that this version has a low rate of JHC dependence for mass parameters, while being similar if not slightly more stringent than previous ones. The new model proposes low initial parameters which cause a small expansion time and hence gives better fit to observations and does not suffer from the known problems relating to primordial potentials. However some issues concerning energy-conserving phase transitions remain open. Our results also raise questions regarding whether certain of the observable differences between traditional inflation theories and others arise due to subtle features of our equations instead of fundamental structural alterations in their structure.",

We show how these methods can be used to classify images in real time using GPUs.

The k-means algorithm partitions an image into k subimages, each of which has a probability distribution over its pixels. Each pixel in the subimage corresponds to one cluster, and each cluster contains a set of pixels belonging to other clusters. In this way, we can group similar objects together by their similarity to each other. We demonstrate that our method performs well on several common image segmentation problems, including object detection, face recognition, and object localization.",

The key idea behind our approach is to partition the training set into two parts: one part contains only images with known labels (e.g., faces), while the other part contains all images without labels (e.g., random noise). Then, we train a classifier on the first part, and then apply it to the second part. This allows us to find clusters of images that have similar features. Our algorithm learns how to efficiently extract features from the image data by using a combination of local search techniques and global optimization techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by solving a classification task on a dataset consisting of more than 1 million images.",
    "This paper introduces two convolutional recurrent neural network architectures, the single-hidden-layer (also known as S-RNN) RNN and the split-window S-RNN, that extract key features from video sequences in real-time.\n\nBoth architectures are designed to extract features from a video sequence in such a manner that they could be subsequently applied to other sequences in a similar way.\n\nTo see how different neural networks have been used to solve this problem, a small video is shown which has a human-like face and speech. The videos begins with a frame containing only white-noise (no faces or speech). The RNN architecture is shown to be able to extract most of the information from the sequence in time but is able to identify a distinct subject-area (like facial expressions) which is not seen in the other face-frame frames yet. To the RNN, the face-frame sequences must belong to a subject-area.\n\nTo understand more about our RNN architecture, here is one sample RNN output that has been learned from a video dataset and which is similar to previous output for the single-hidden-layer S-RNN.

Currently one of their leading commercial projects is a face recognition algorithm called QUEENFace that was launched last year by Amazon Echo. A new paper by researchers of IIT Kanpur has been published in IJCAI where it discusses an advance technique of physically modeling features of an object or scene. It also talks about improving the model with computer generated imagery to better reflect and represent the original subject. More specifically it focuses on modeling the skin in 3D using volumetric rendering (e.g. volumetric lighting) rather than only its texture coordinates which led to inefficient calculation since both data sets are highly correlated.

This article seeks not only to enhance our understanding on image interpretation, but also on how to use such models to build new algorithms such as a face detection system.\nPaper title Image Representation Using Volumetric Lighting In Three Dimensions - New Advance in Computer Vision  by Bikash Gupta (IBM/IAS), Sandip Gudjewi & Kavya Tiwari-Vardhan (Towards Efficient Computation Methods in Information Sciences)   Abstract As far back as 1992 when M. Cravatt first introduced the idea of rendering images from a 2D perspective using multiple texture planes and then converting them into a set volume, it was widely assumed that this concept could be efficiently integrated into contemporary computers (Futuyma, 1984). However, in recent years, the amount and quality of available images (such as those provided via the internet which provide a large number views) have increased exponentially enabling the study of many kinds of scenes (e.g., environments, buildings; weather conditions) to make use of these different types of information. While these problems can be tackled from various angles, there remain significant challenges associated with making meaningful progress towards a universal way of representing the entire visual scene, ranging from large datasets whose resolution changes depending upon context, to issues related to dynamic scenes which continually change shape and composition.  Here we present a comprehensive approach to generating",
    "Image segmentation involves removing irrelevant information from images, such as artifacts generated at image acquisition time (e.g., spatial frequency differences between objects). These issues can be addressed using traditional approach including contours and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), but pose challenges of being inflexible, slow to train, requires high data quality for training, and suffers many drawbacks like unannotated samples for both classification (i.e., classification accuracy) and detection (as in the case of human faces versus vehicles). Additionally, since most of these methods primarily focus on the reconstruction of feature vectors with respect to a given dataset size, this poses performance problems for very large datasets (>1TB) even if they have good classification/detection power. Despite improvements over the past years, there remained several unsolved issues that could lead toward an efficient image segmentation technique that would be suitable for highly complex classifiers and robustly support real-world applications. In this work, i will introduce new techniques for the nonlinear representation (nonlinear regression on L2) of image features, derived through application of active contouring algorithms. These representational nonlinearities help provide higher resolution features along small curvatures while avoiding the limitations associated with current approaches using dense LDA/contrast measurements or linear discriminant analyses. Our novel NonLinear Regression on Feature Functions approach exploits the low energy landscape for each image for which it is desired to learn the shape, position, and angle of the contour. This allows us to recover accurate topographic representations at scale far beyond those achievable by LDA. Furthermore, our approach allows for multiple iterations during reconstruction, allowing the effective exploration of different settings for segmentation without loss of structure. Finally, we develop machinelearning classes for car classification and facial recognition and test them against three representative datasets of highway drivers. We demonstrate improved detection and better classification of female faces in comparison to previous generation face databases. Given these results and our success on various real situations requiring real data sets at scale, this novel framework may prove well suited for solving other real world problem areas where image segmentations are crucial.",
    "[Paper title: Test-Time Training for Deformable Multi-Scale Image Registration]\n\nThe goal of this paper is to apply time-aware, multivariate image registration back-propagation to deformation or object classification problems. At the core of this work is the notion of two object features that define a class, an image feature that defines a object, and a latent function that allows evaluation of the representation of these two features during training. To facilitate training, we model an object as an ensemble of discrete images with the same two features and learn a classification function by combining and adjusting features from each individual object.\n\nThe latent function will be a discrete random variable that will be used to perform classification on the input image. However, due to the lack of time-coding the latent function will be non-deterministic. To solve this problem, we introduce a time-coding scheme based on a hybrid neural network with a single hidden layer with a time-delayed hidden activation. We define a sparse random embedding of these features into each class of two object features (one feature per class for the latent function) while simultaneously training an ensemble of discrete random variables (with a sparse probability matrix) to model the discrete variables over these features. We implement the method for a two-layer structure, which is suitable for both unsupervised and supervised training.\n\nWe observe that by using time-dependent, multivariate image registration, we are able to simultaneously train a classifier, which encodes (properly) the binary classification, for any single training image (for some class size k). The number of instances trained for a single training image typically can be more than the number of actual training images. Our algorithm can, thus, be trained to perform the classification on any image where the number of instance of image training has not exceeded some bound.\n\n\nAbstract: Test-Time Training for Deformable Multi-Scale Image Registration\n\nThe goal of this paper is to apply time-aware, multivariate image registration back-propagation to deformation or object classification problems.

    "Semi automatic data augmentation using masks and feature maps\n\n\nSemi automatic data augmentation uses masking features to train local discriminative regions (localizers) within an image to predict semantic distance values given target and training inputs. In a traditional supervised learning context, localizers are implemented using feature maps or regularization metrics that control their learning rate independently of input. This leads to highly variable, unpredictable learning rates which increase variance in subsequent models, especially when multiple sublinear models perform on identical observations with diverse target inputs. As such, typical use cases involve training multiple discriminative maps simultaneously over the entire dataset with each map having slightly different training weights, resulting in a poor match between model estimates and observed targets. A more effective approach, where each individual mapping maintains its exact form across time, is to train a small number of discrete feature maps instead. These can be generated by adding a few mask blocks and averaging them across all images to get a weighted sum representation that does not change as quickly without any adaptation step as feature maps used for sparse data sets like object faces alone would tend to do. These maps can then be applied across training frames and tested independently of the other predictions (i.e., prediction error). Despite being far less computationally intensive or subjectively demanding than previous methods, this method cannot provide sufficient accuracy for real world usage and requires the additional step where the training frames must be saved and processed as separate classes for cross validation purposes that increases coding complexity significantly, and also makes it susceptible to loss of performance in some training experiments. Thus, for semi-automatic segmentation, the most interesting classifier is one built around feature maps and feature vectors, where each localizer is trained specifically on a different set of images where each feature maps is extracted from one or a few input features. The goal was to make fully convolutional layer-wise discriminant separators (fully-connected units), with sparse representations for output neurons that are able to learn a new spatial encoding model efficiently using only the training information from the target-space subgraphs they have seen recently along with all learned subgraph transformations.\n\n\nTo accomplish these goals via feature maps, we constructed a neural network architecture consisting of an LSTM (Leveraging Surface Feature Matrix Transcatheter Network Model) kernel at the top which encodes image features",

    "Abstract\n\nWe present an approach to understanding neural pathways in zebrafish using deep learning and high resolution electron microscopy data. We use this approach to identify the neuronal subtypes that are involved in different aspects of locomotion, including swimming, feeding, and sensing. Our results show that the majority of neurons in the dorsal fin have no known function, but instead appear to be redundant with other neurons. In addition, we find that the number of neurons in the dorsal fin increases as fish swim faster, suggesting that these neurons may play important roles in regulating speed. Finally, we demonstrate that the number of neurons in the dorsal fin decreases as fish swim slower, indicating that they may also play important roles in regulating speed. These findings suggest that the dorsal fin is not simply a passive appendage, but rather a complex network of neurons that can control both speed and direction.",
    "Abstract Magnetic coupling and motion (for example, magnetostriction) are typically attributed to the magnetism of the magnetomechanical substrate, which is assumed to be a single-layer material. The mechanism of that coupling, if there is one, can only be attributed to a superposition of the magnetic domains of different layers. Despite the growing knowledge about single-layer magnetic transport properties at the nanoscale, the magnetic domains are apparently not sufficiently characterized to be considered as single-layer magnetic materials. Here, we demonstrate that different combinations of four magnetos and their interaction domains can modulate the magnetic coupling from single-layer to multi-layered materials of different density. Our results are obtained by observing the variation in the orientation of the interaction domains within a 2-D lattice (2L) of magneto/motive force interactions between the magnetomechanical domains. Through numerical analysis, we find that the magnetized domains in 2L can be used as effective magnetic domains for single-layer magnetic transport.\nThe team also included researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Tsinghua University. \nThis research was published on June 3th, 2014.\nThe team of researchers stated that the next step in the research is to determine the optimal layout of the interactions, which would lead to better overall performance.

    "Introduction The recent discovery of the so-called Black Hand of Ra revealed an ancient lineage of powerful Egyptian mystics that had been hidden away in Egypt, long before the time known to history as Aten or Osiris – these are the earliest examples of esoteric knowledge still intact amongst mankind (Harrison et al. 1993; Hancock 1996). It is generally assumed by researchers such as Hancock, Rene Girard (2004) and Peter Tinti (2001), that there may be even more powerful sources of magical power beyond our earthly realm. One of those sources of unknown power was apparently discovered within the Egyptian pyramids by Egyptian occultist Hermes Trismegistus during his quest for immortality. This source allegedly is responsible the creation of physical objects such as the pyramids. Its name? Yggdrasill. As mentioned above, this term for this mysterious force is spelled with a 'G' instead of an 'I'. Why would one spell something using the latter spelling versus the former spelling, when both spellings share the same underlying concept which can only be explained through some kind of a common ancestor relationship? In my opinion, if I had all the answers to the question why you should look for one set over another, I would certainly choose the first explanation. After completing the first draft of an extensive article about Yggdrasil, I then published it on my blog; it received a rather mixed reception from readers who felt the author did not properly give credit to other sources of similar work, including, but not limited to Yee-Bot. However, considering Yee-Bot's efforts was not enough, someone finally showed me the video I linked here (YouTube): The video was made by Christian Huyghens' personal account on YouTube titled The YGGDRASIL Mystery Exposed. Christian was able to accurately identify Yggdrasil based primarily on its appearance. He stated, \"[Y]ggdrasil has a shape that closely resembles a human figure about 6 feet high [1.67 m] and 1.54 meters wide.\" When asked what exactly this figure looked like he replied, \"it looks like a giant statue where the arms come almost straight up from ground level with the head slightly tucked underneath\" in addition, \"'It is said that some of the Egyptians knew about the true nature/source of",
    "We study image segmentation using complex feature transforms, such as ROC curve (RC), in combination with general classification algorithm on both training data sets, which comprise images tagged either with cat or dog. We use these tools to generate supervised training/test/validation datasets of high accuracy that were compared against each other without regard to tag or target label. Because the target category is not used in any way in the training set or evaluation data, we are able to extract useful features from this kind of problem-solving approach. We demonstrate a generic approach for multi-layered image reconstruction across two tasks: semantic annotation or identification, whereas classifies for labeling purposes based on image similarities, rather than image content. This provides an opportunity to train a new neural network architecture that can do both at once and outperform our more established approaches in both training instances while maintaining its power if trained on unannotated datasets without labels such as those generated by Facebook's Cat Picture Tagger.",

In this study we provide a quantitative and practical demonstration of CNN-LSTM models of city expansion using both static and dynamic population data.\n\nIn the above study it is being proposed that CNN-LSTM (aka 'deep CNN') networks that model visual data (e.g. city census data, imagery data, etc) are more effective than more traditional and simpler neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and support vector machines (SVM) for the purpose of generating city population estimates.

    "In this study we address issues related to deep-geodeic shape learning that arise during segmentation on large datasets, using convolutional neural networks with 2D input space. We employ two methods to overcome these obstacles - an ad hoc training methodology from which some accuracy can be obtained for training time, and a robust feature engineering approach, based largely on a landmark analysis procedure implemented in C4. However, our results are limited by lack of generality with respect to image artifacts present and observed in the human body. We propose a novel approach aimed at removing such artifacts by minimizing the loss inherent in feature reconstruction as part of the inference process. To investigate this procedure in practice, our results rely upon a novel algorithm, the non-rectangular feature extraction (NSE) technique. In all cases where NSE does not provide adequate accuracy, it serves as a check against possible biases introduced by other techniques used or unavailable for the problem domain to be solved. The main idea behind our implementation is that as long as there exists no identifiable object within the image and only natural features like shadows are involved, then the result remains reliable to approximating geometric form and landmarks. It should also help uncover architectural constraints during the segmentation and identify their specific location on multiple images.",
    "Abstract:\nIn this study, we show that the paracrine signaling pathway mediates the effect of chronic stress on spine morphology and function. We found that chronic stress induces an increase in the expression of the protein kinase C (PKC) subunit p38 MAPK, which promotes the formation of new spines by activating the transcription factor CREB. In addition to its effects on spine formation, chronic stress also increases the expression of the protein phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which inhibits the activity of the transcription factor NF-κB. These results suggest that the increased expression of PKC and PI3K may be involved in the regulation of spine morphogenesis and spine function.",

    "In recent years social scientists have turned the attention of the general public towards \"collaborative interactions\" and have developed new theories on how cooperation works. Many of these theories are rooted in psychology (e.g., kin selection; social comparison; group choice), which suggests we need to consider individuals' experiences and perspective as well as group members' interests to understand the evolution of cooperation [ 1 – 5 ]. Despite this general trend in social psychology, to the best of our knowledge no empirical analyses have so far examined the role of \"social dynamics\" in the evolution of co-operative patterns in humans [ 5, 7 – 11 ]. The hypothesis of \"social dynamics\" was formulated as a potential solution to the difficulty of linking social interaction in social groups to behavioral patterns that promote group success in species of animals, such as humans [ 6 ].\nIn such studies one group of organisms (e.g., humans) is considered as the \"collective organism\" and is subjected to the \"behavioral ecology\" of a different \"consortium\" composed of different individuals (e.g., other humans). In addition to \"dying alone\" (e.g., when the collectivity disappears in an experimental setting) ( 1 ) social cooperation in a consortium, that promotes group survival, is also observed in other cooperative behaviors and experiments in both animals and humans.\nConsistent with these results, one might assume that individuals do not have free will, but do rather follow the lead of the collective organism, and that social selection plays a strong role over evolutionary time: \"Cooperation is a kind of'social selection' (or 'evolutionary adaptation') in which individuals follow the lead of the collective,\" says Robert Trivers [ 5 ]. Thus, the goal of this paper is to apply theoretical tools to the understanding of the dynamics and origins of group decision making in humans.\nThis paper examines the role of \"social dynamics\" in the origin, evolution, and maintenance of group cooperation in humans and other animals. We test three hypotheses: 1) Humans and other animals are subject to social selection and competition for resources, resulting in a strong evolutionary effect of group co-operation on group\nbehaviour, 2) Evolutionary forces are strong enough so that social and cooperative traits co-vary, and 3) Social selection and",

    "Analogical symmetry in games often serves as an incentive to cooperate, and the principle underpinning this strategy of cooperation has been called symmetry breaking, but no study until now directly demonstrated how the principle applies symmetrically to different types of non-symmetrical game playing approaches. In our experiment we observed whether asymmetrical 3 player, as well as all other 2, 3, or 4-person 3 color prisoner's dilemma matches could be played symmetrically by comparing their optimal strategies. We found that, without any changes in game strategy, the asymmetry can explain both mutual cooperation (as in the two 1 versus 2 games) or non-mutual cooperation ('A' vs 'B'). This opens up many new avenues for game design, particularly when examining strategies for cooperative games against competitive players, where players may behave cooperatively based on some underlying asymmetry in their decision making abilities.",

    "\"When a tumor segment of the gastric-duodenal junction is fed back into the brain, it is not completely reprogrammed. The tumor segment does not die. Instead, it undergoes local degeneration, which is then re-enriched for its future use through pattern-based reinforcement. The result is that this tumor segment, which before underwent massive shrinkage and was in disrepair, is now reinvigorated and returns to healthy size. The current approach exploits the strength of reprogramming by leveraging partial segmentation. We design a model-free neural network architecture that fully maps on the structure of the neural network of the original tumor segment. We demonstrate the efficacy of the network at reconstructing the original tumor segment and re-releasing it to maintain the original morphology, while maintaining the local degeneration and tumor segment fusion. By using the network's reconstruction model, we are able to efficiently detect the original tumor segment and release it for later use.",

To this end we observed two types of Twitter accounts in our study (e.g. @tweetmyfriends_1 and @twitmysfriend_1). Using both these user profiles and an indicator that measured their popularity, it was possible to determine changes in Twitter conversation over time due to change of the Twitter user profile. As expected, following both account caused users of each network to be exposed to more conversations than less popular or less-following accounts who also did not follow account. Additionally, since only 10% of all total tweets received during the month were related to two users that had no interaction with other accounts in any way. After being shown how popular @tweetmyfriends_1 was at any given moment between January 2011 to May 2012, we expected increased number of new Tweets received by users following this account over time. In fact, users following @lizbooshuys_5 generated 1.21 times as much new tweets compared to those below them [7], suggesting they gained significant visibility for posting about Liz. Therefore, users of a particular user's accounts are likely to influence the overall behaviour of a target network.

Our proposed system achieves an adaptive filtering ratio between 0.5 to 1 depending on the size of the region within which it adjusts; an adaptive filter at the same viewing distance has low computational complexity. We present 3 tests that show how well our VisDA system applies to various types of input objects and input content on an LCD screen. Finally, we suggest some ways to further the development of VisDA technology into a general-purpose image classification or adaptation mechanism.\n\nIn brief, here's what you need to know about this study (and this video). First off, there are two video files with more than 4 million frames each. Those videos were taken by researchers at Caltech in 2009, so it remains unclear yet if and when the software used will help them recreate the effect seen during these videos:\n\nThere's also a nice explanation of how the visda works over at Discover Magazine, describing the theory behind what they call \"visual adaptation.\" Then again, maybe all that goes over pretty well at my school...",
    "Abstract\n\nWe present a novel method for segmenting images into fine-to-coarse (f/c) regions, which we call CFCM. We show that this method can be used to extract high-resolution features from low-resolution images and to perform image classification tasks with very good accuracy. Our approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is trained on a large dataset of images. The CNN learns to recognize f/c regions by first extracting feature vectors from each image using a coarse-to-fine (fc/f) transformation. These feature vectors are then used as input to an LSTM layer, which performs a second convolutional operation on them to produce a final feature vector. This process is repeated until all the f/c regions have been extracted. In addition to being able to classify images in terms of their spatial location, our method also allows us to identify objects in images based on their shape.",

    "We present an analysis of stellar population density and stellar mass distribution in the Milky Way using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the galactic bulge contains about 1,000 times more stars than our own Galaxy. The average star size is about 10 solar masses, which is similar to the mean stellar mass of the Sun. Our results indicate that the Milky Way has a high fraction of low-mass stars with a large number of red giants. These observations are consistent with models of galaxy evolution where the bulge was formed by accretion of gas from the early Universe.",
    "Abstract\n\nWe study the stability of toric manifold geometries, which are characterized by a finite number of points and an infinite number of faces. We show that these geometries can be described in terms of a simple geometric structure called the torus. The torus has two main properties: it is stable to rotations about any axis, and it is stable to translations along any direction. This property allows us to use the torus as a model for many other geometrical structures, such as the tetrahedron or the icosahedron. In particular, we find that the torus is a good candidate for modeling the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the universe.",
    "Min-Cut Clustering\n\nIn this work, we derive an information theoretic derivation of min-cut based clustering (MC) that can be used to efficiently find clusters in large data sets. We show how MC can be applied to solve problems such as classification and regression. Our approach uses a novel algorithm called Min-Cluster Search (MCS), which is based on the idea of minimization of the cost function over all possible configurations of the cluster. MCS is implemented using a simple greedy algorithm that allows us to quickly compute the minimum number of clusters required to achieve a given objective. The resulting algorithm is able to perform well even when the number of clusters is very large. In addition, our method is robust against different types of errors, including incorrect parameter selection, missing values, and mislabeling.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by solving two real world problems: classification and regression. First, we present a new classifier, the K-Means Classifier, which is able to classify images into three classes with high accuracy. Second, we apply our method to a problem known as the k-means clustering problem, where we are trying to identify the most probable location of points within a set of images. This task requires finding the best combination of features to maximize the probability of finding a point within a given image. Using our method, we were able to find the optimal configuration of clusters for each of these tasks.",

    "We present an algorithm for camera pose estimation and pose reconstruction which uses Deep Learning as a generative model. It is faster, more accurate and more flexible than current algorithms for pose estimation and pose reconstruction. Our approach is not deterministic and based on Bayesian statistics. It is inspired by a number of recent work on the subject of pose estimation and inference with generative models. Our computational architecture consists of: a recurrent neural network with an input activation function, the objective function, the prior distributions and its mean and covariance matrix and a generative model for the prior distribution consisting of an autoencoder, the objective function, the prior distributions and their mean-covariance matrices. The learning process is implemented on an GPU and uses a variational inference framework to estimate the model parameters such as error and the likelihood for a particular hidden state vector. The result can be compared to conventional pose estimation algorithms, such as k-means, and even to other deep learning systems, such as neural networks trained with logistic regression and L1/L2 loss functions. We further provide an evaluation of the algorithm on a small sample of video surveillance footage from China with 5,000 camera stances, and we demonstrate significant improvements in model performance compared to state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithms. To summarize, the approach is capable of finding a camera pose very quickly. The approach is robust and produces a model that can distinguish between identical and different camera poses with high accuracy. In this paper, we describe our results and discuss their applications to real world applications.\n\nFor more technical details on the paper, check the paper.",
    "Abstract: We propose a generalized convolutional neural network (FedDG), which achieves accurate continuous frequency representation of medical images with a very low time-space tradeoff. Unlike previous ConvNet architectures that require high-level structures from the input to achieve high-level accuracy, FedDG enables the generation of highly approximate structures from low-level input sequences. Specifically, we propose an efficient technique for combining multiple high-level components representing different time scales in a continuous (and invariant) space, to efficiently approximate continuous time space. Our analysis shows that a novel recurrent architecture, combined with a novel adversarial network that focuses on non-linear temporal patterns, allows for accurate medical image segmentation that reduces the time to classify an image to a single percentage.\n\nIn order to make this technology available for healthcare companies to use on their imaging centers or other medical centers to facilitate the rapid detection of abnormalities on MRI devices, the authors of this study are presenting their findings at the 13th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2017 which is about to start in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

    "Apparent multifractality: The apparent multimodality of L\\(N\\)-self-similar neural networks In this work, we study the ability of neural networks to form similar networks. In this way, we address problems in the theory of the neural networks that have been commonly proposed by those who make a major contribution to machine learning. We perform an experiment that explicitly shows the lack of a multimodality in the network of neural networks trained on two training sets, the first with a fixed number of elements, and the second with a variable number of elements. We obtain an increase of the number of clusters in the largest of the clusters by an amount proportional to the number of elements in the first set (by a factor of 2 in our experiment, when we allow a constant proportion of elements). The apparent multimodality does not imply a theoretical necessity that we call the \"Bubble Hypothesis\", since it does not make clear why we obtained the increase in size in the network with increasing number of clusters. We also present experimental results that clearly demonstrate that the increase of the number of clusters in the network with increasing number of elements is due to a nonlinearity, so that there is no increase in the maximum length of the network. Our results establish that there is non-parametric scaling in the L\\(N\\)-network of neural networks whose apparent multifractality and parametric scaling have been demonstrated in prior work.",

    "We present an algorithm that can be used to overfit a neural network, which means it will learn more about the data than it should. We show how this can lead to incorrect classification decisions in some real-world applications. The main idea behind our approach is to use a simple heuristic to determine whether or not a given model has learned too much. This heuristic relies on the fact that if we have two classes (e.g., red and blue), then there are only three possible combinations of labels between them. If we consider all possible combinations of these three labels, then we can calculate the probability that any combination of those three labels would occur as the label for each of the three classes. In other words, we can compute the likelihood of each possible combination of the three labels occurring as the label for each of the three classes. For example, suppose we have a dataset with 10 categories, where each category consists of one color and one shape. Then the likelihood of each possible combination of colors and shapes being the label for each of the ten categories is 1/10 = 0.1. Thus, the likelihood of any combination of colors and shapes being the label for each of the ten categories is 0.1 * 10 = 0.01. Similarly, the likelihood of any combination of colors and shapes being the label for each of the ten categories is 0.01 * 10 = 0.001. Therefore, the likelihood of any combination of colors and shapes being the label for each of the ten categories is 0.001 * 10 = 0.000001. To see why this works, let's look at a few examples. Suppose we have a dataset consisting of 100 images of cats. Each image contains either a cat or a dog. Let's say that the average number of pixels per cat is 2.5. Now, suppose we want to classify the images into four different categories: cat, dog, cat and dog. We could do this by looking at the distribution of pixel values across the entire image. However, this method does not take into account the possibility that the same image might contain both a cat and a dog. So, instead, we'll look at the distribution of pixel values within each category. If we assume that the average number of pixels per category is 3, then the distribution of pixel values within each category is [",
    "Abstract Genetic algorithms are becoming more popular as models for solving large-scale adaptive problems, yet are poorly suited as the sole solution to such optimization problems. This paper presents a genetic algorithm for the dual-soliton solution to an optimization problem of dimension 1. In particular, there are dual-soliton systems with three atomic states and three energy levels  and two components  whose orbital energy and magnetic moments are specified by a fixed list of fixed coefficients.  Generating a map of potentials to potentials from the dual-soliton atoms generates a map of orbital energies to orbital energies for each component.  The map is then used to estimate a solution on a grid  based on the possible solutions for dual-soliton atoms in the grid cell with  the lowest possible energy.  The results of this analysis show how the grid cell approach can be made more efficient.\n[CJE: I'm glad to see that we're talking about a grid problem here….]",

    "The concept of computational hidden Markov models (hmk) has been extensively studied through the research of John Baez and coauthors and has been used in various forms of neuroscience. We developed HMK methods with a novel architecture and parameterization as an application to Maximum Likelihood Neuron Re-assembly model (hmkMR), which is a robust yet simple model that is used to reconstruct neuronal assemblies using an unbiased sampling. We applied a novel HMK technique that allows the reconstruction of functional synapses hidden from the signal. The HMK method is based on a non-determinism principle and an adaptive algorithm that enables the model to learn to optimize for minimizing the total sampling cost. In particular, the HMK methods provides a flexible and scalable alternative to the widely used method of Maximum Likelihood Monte Carlo with non-linear stochastic noise for cortical fMRI. We also evaluated the HMK methods performance using the whole-cell patch clamping method, a well-established method in which the signal is averaged over each voxel and an estimated likelihood of the cell is compared with the voxel probability density. Results confirm that HMK methods are efficient for cortical fMRI and, as expected, are comparable to the state-of-the-art method using Monte Carlo with non-differential noise.\n\nYou don't actually have to read all the way to the end of the page to see a \"real-world\" demonstration of the power and value of the HMM (in particular its use for maximum likelihood reconstruction).\n\nA colleague of mine recently gave a presentation at the IEEE Neural Information Processing Systems conference in which he showed off a demonstration of how an HMM can be used to recover a previously-unknown form of long-range spontaneous neural activity.

We characterize the texture approximation quality by its mean error of gradient estimates, using the Fourier transform technique [19a], and investigate how its gradient estimate distribution maps on to the desired target space, using a variational approach called \"Affine\" estimation [20]. We demonstrate two different implementations of the system with varied computational rates, and demonstrate that high rates yield better, less noisy results that more modest methods; even after tens or hundreds iterations of texture approximation. Furthermore, our results suggest that when used alongside prior information about the image quality of the data being sampled, the Affine estimation strategy produces slightly better resulting profiles than the traditional smoothing route.

    "Abstract The present study investigated the structure and dynamics of brain functional networks during anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness (AILOC). We used fMRI to measure blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the primary visual cortex (V1), which was induced by ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist. AILOC was induced with a single intravenous injection of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) or saline. During anesthesia, V1 BOLD signal decreased significantly compared to baseline values. Ketamine administration resulted in significant increases in the number of neurons in the right hemisphere of V1 that were activated by visual stimuli. These results suggest that the decrease in V1 BOLD signal observed during anesthesia may be due to a reduction in the activity of the network responsible for processing visual information.",

    "Abstract The Hinode (H-1) observatory, located on the island of Hawaii, has been observing the Sun since its inception in 1958. It was designed to observe the Sun's corona and plasma environment at high resolution, but it also provides an opportunity to study the effects of reconnection events on the Sun's magnetic field. In this paper we present observations of the Hinode's H-1 solar jets that were made between January 1st and March 31st, 2012. We find that the observed jet oscillations are not due to changes in the Sun's rotation rate or the Sun's magnetic field, as previously suggested by other researchers. Instead, they appear to be caused by the interaction of the Sun's magnetic field with the surrounding interstellar medium. This interaction causes the Sun's magnetic field to vibrate at frequencies that are much higher than those expected from the Sun's rotation rate. These results suggest that reconnection events may have important consequences for the Sun's magnetic field.",
    "\"The following paper is a demonstration of an unsupervised and semi-supervised method for learning linear and nonlinear models of left anterior posterior segmentation based on high-resolution images from the anterior coronal plane. We propose an optimal, semi-supervised deep learning algorithm [17] trained on the training data. The proposed algorithm successfully distinguishes both the images of real and simulated human brains, outperforming state-of-the-art systems using both the state-of-the-art methods and no prior knowledge. The high-resolution images are compared against the previously described semi-supervised method for automatic segmentation using the same high-resolution images, and a comparative comparison results to reveal the general strengths and weaknesses of both methods, respectively.\n\nIn the present paper, the proposed method can be directly applied to segment an image of a human brain into its topology. The proposed algorithm is applied to non-human brains as well using a high definition low-resolution MRI scanner to estimate the segmentation topology. In a first test, the method was able to accurately infer the segmentations in an image of a real human brain. Next, a series of simulations were implemented to understand the neural network model that is optimized in the proposed method. After these simulations, we found that the proposed method effectively learns a neural network model that is more precise than the semi-supervised method. This suggests that the proposed method can be applied to non-human brains as well.\"",
    "Abstract The aim of this work is to investigate whether Angular equivalence holds in the case of normed spaces, i.e., if there exists an equivalent set of functions that can be applied to any two points on a sphere and return the same result as the original function. We show that the answer is yes, and we also prove that it holds for arbitrary normed spaces. In particular, we find that the corresponding set of functions is the same as the set of functions defined by the angular coordinates of the point. This means that the set of functions defined by the angle between two vectors is the same as the set of functions defined by the angles between two points. We further show that the set of functions defined by the angle between two vectors is the same as the set of functions defined by the angle between two points. Finally, we show that the set of functions defined by the angle between two vectors is the same as the set of functions defined by the angle between two points. Our results are consistent with the notion of angular equivalence, which states that the set of functions defined by the angle between two vectors is the same as the set of functions defined by the angle between two points.\n\nI'm not sure what I think about this one.

    "Abstract The central aim of this project was to develop algorithms and techniques for building large learning representations as part of training on human segmentations, in particular object classification and face detection by generating and identifying the most salient features of objects within a reference image for training. As described herein, these efforts build upon previous work involving hierarchical approaches based directly or indirectly on machine learning's multilayer perceptrons, to represent multiple regions and localizing them with respect to each other as a function of their location in the original image. Further, a key strategy for improving recognition performance has been to scale up the representation until an accuracy threshold is met by using more than one layer per region. Here, we explore novel methods aimed at automatically producing a larger number of such layers and, thus, scaling up the accuracy level reached during training, with emphasis to apply such algorithms to new real examples rather than simply existing ones, while preserving as much information about objects as possible at any given time across different layers. Our techniques are inspired by previous work on building structured representations on simple inputs (Mori et al., 1998, 2003) where high level features were mapped together via a series of global hidden units called'super-columns'. In contrast, our approach uses more complex processes which employ many distinct feature transformations that result in two different and coherent representations of the same domain–such processes can be thought of as being nested hierarchically in order to enable flexible construction of complex models, that can operate without the constraints of having access to very fine spatial-temporal detail. We introduce several types of hyperplanes, that act as different scales along which our network's components may change over time. While some authors have also explored these hyperplane structures (Schreiber & Nunez, 2006; Yuen et al., 2007), they tend either to rely only on explicit distance functions used for calculating internal weights or fail to incorporate appropriate attention schemes for controlling this structure. Accordingly we propose here both new weight and attention measures of relevance of each element from each of our hyperplane super-columns to their neighbours (e.g., x_t, f' ), along similar distance functions defined between regions representing various parts of the target image space with particular prominence. Furthermore, we provide the ability for different kinds of attention mechanisms to control the behavior of individual subsets of these hyperplanes",

We used a collaborative environment (CoE) model to investigate whether opinions influence the behavior of individuals within a group. In particular, we examined how opinions affect the decision-making process of individuals who have conflicting views about an issue. Our results show that when there are no opinions, people tend to follow their own interests rather than those of others. However, when there are opinions, people tend to follow the opinion of other members of the group. This suggests that opinions can be useful tools for facilitating cooperation among groups.",
    "A bounding volume to approximate a large-scale shape (such as a city) can be used in data mining, 3D computer graphics, etc. Using spatial extent for segmentation can provide accuracy that is close to the true bounding regions; however, this approach assumes that there are no gaps between regions or otherwise ambiguity about what edges represent boundaries – which is not always the case. In this work, we apply a convolutional network to a sparse grid of rectangles over the open region surrounding a geographic location. While our method yields error rates that are typically smaller than 25%, they remain sensitive to small errors (e.g., the intersection of a neighboring point may be inside your window). Additionally, if you have an unconstrained mapping dataset with nonlinearity across different boundary shapes such as curved features, then we recommend learning on real datasets rather than approximating geometrically on a sparsely-mapped grid.\n\n\nAbstract from abstract by Yuliang Chen et al:\n\nIn this work, we introduce Boundary Aware Segmentation Networks (BASNs), which allow for effective use of constrained or unconstrained mappings for high-accuracy prediction tasks on complex geographies spanning entire continents and hemispheres and include spatial, topographic, temporal and anthropological information. A BASN learns a hierarchical supervised map by performing edge detection in 3D grids, which includes both sparse grid regions and densely mapped subregions (Figure 1b, figure 1c). The user specifies these geomap parameters at initialization time when embedding a new set of points into the 3D model. We implemented several variations on this theme including basins and boundermaps. In particular, we demonstrated classification performance of 64% on one example of urban maps in China and found that an average SAT improvement was 14% compared to other methods when learning these spatial features efficiently with SAT alone. Our results demonstrate robust performance for predicting geography from image labels in challenging situations where previous approaches failed, especially in noisy data environments and poor alignment or labeling ability.\n\n\nAs they state above, this idea could be applied anywhere including maps like those produced by Google Earth.\n\nIn this post I wanted to walk through two related algorithms that the authors refer to later – DNNS and BNSV – which I find helpful since it",

Our results show that our method provides a reliable way to obtain absolute measurements of the quantum efficiency of a single photon detector.",

    "\"We present a novel method for automatically segmenting the left atrium from cardiac images using successive 3D U-Nets and a contour loss. We show that the method is able to detect the left atrium in a large number of patients with a high degree of accuracy. The method is based on the concept of a contour loss, which is a measure of the degree of curvature of the left atrium. We show that the contour loss is a good measure of the degree of curvature of the left atrium, and that it is sensitive to the degree of curvature of the left atrium. We also show that the method is sensitive to the degree of curvature of the left atrium in the presence of a left atrial septal defect. We also show that the method is sensitive to the degree of curvature of the left atrium in the presence of a left atrial septal defect and that it is sensitive to the degree of curvature of the left atrium in the presence of a left atrial septal defect and a left atrial septal defect.

    "Abstract The van der Waals force between two surfaces can be calculated by using the density functional theory (DFT) method to calculate the van der Waals forces between the surfaces. We have studied the effect of the surface topology on the van der Waals forces in bulk materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and diamond. In this work we show that the van der Waals force depends strongly on the surface topology. This result suggests that the van der Waals force may be used as an index of surface roughness for determining the surface roughness of bulk materials.",
    "When the Universe is undergoing a series of fundamental fluctuations (such as cosmic inflation, the Big Bang and the current expansion of the Universe), as well as interactions between the fundamental particles in the Universe, it leads to new laws of physics when applied to it, which have an unknown impact on the theory of relativity.\nIn particular, the question of unification of the three fundamental forces, gravitation, the magnetic field, and electromagnetic force, can be considered as a kind of a puzzle in quantum mechanics, and since the equations of quantum mechanics have been solved in many cases the unification of these laws has been a quest and a long-standing mystery. Many theoretical solutions have been proposed, but no experimental demonstration of the proposed equations has been made so far.\nFrom the first, it was suggested by Lidar to perform the experiment \"in quantum-mechanical sense\" and also to consider the theory of quantum field theory instead of classical field theory (from which the mathematical framework of field theory is constructed), because the proposed quantum-mechanical equations are simpler and closer to observed phenomena than those of classical field theory. Although Lidar realized that these are not the only two possible solutions, he did not consider the possibility of the experiment \"in a more extended quantum-mechanical sense\". With the application of a new technique, the experiment is now performed based on a \"virtual group\" of particles in a single classical field (which is equivalent to the superconducting circuits of a quantum computer), that is the \"group theory of spin-spin\", in order to determine a new equation with quantum-mechanical behavior and to find the new \"unifying field theory\", that is the \"symmetry theory of the fundamental forces\".\nIn addition, the collaboration has established a fundamental connection with the research on cosmology, especially the cosmological quantum-mechanics at large scale and its implications on the search for the existence of an ultimate structure in nature.\n\"",
    "We study hierarchically contoured networks (HCN) and use them to study their computational properties in two different problems, which are: (i) numerical computation by simulating discrete elements in complex geometry; i.e., how do computations vary with time? And, (ii) theoretical considerations that allow one to predict properties of HCNs like its shape and complexity using very sparse information. We describe our results in simple and realistic scenarios. Our conclusion is that in certain cases it can be difficult for humans to find specific structures based on the available data without much computational effort despite being intuitive objects in high dimensions. An example might include an image segmentation, where we estimate a 3D structure after approximating its contour. In practice these models tend to look similar, even if they have completely nonmonotonic behavior. To overcome this problem we propose a hierarchical algorithm as first approximation procedure, while in principle other methods used in previous algorithms is sufficient for all practical uses.\n\nWe'll be keeping track and update the article with some more great stuff related to fractals, hierarchy, and geometric graphs here at Architizer.

In this work we demonstrate that the technique can also be used to clone images that are not diffracted by a laser beam, but rather are captured by an optical trap.

    "\"An empirical study on learning convolutions from sparse data and how to improve their performance in certain instances that would cause loss at an early stage during training.\"\n\nNote: Although we are giving an abbreviated answer, these are some very challenging problems and no doubt a good portion of humanity has experienced them over the years, particularly if you have had a previous learning experience.\n\n\nAbstract from the pdf (p.1)\n\nWe introduce the error correcting boosting algorithm as an alternative approach to correct errors introduced by poorly sampled features (see [2]. It aims to detect the unsupervised errors such that they can be removed from the final predictions, based purely on non-supervised features obtained via sampling methods applied directly to the training set but lacking a prior knowledge of each individual feature that affects its quality. If successful it will allow us to build neural networks whose network topologies change according to different representations (e.g., learned via supervised or unsupervised techniques). We train our algorithm using a deep learning framework which does not learn any kind or structure of representation (i.e. all layers apply one'style') to achieve state of art performances over many popular tasks such as object recognition, image generation, speech synthesis, etc..\n\nFrom this section you need understand two things: What neural networks use to transform their outputs into true input vectors (i.e., learn something), and how error propagation works — it's often described separately by various names including feed forward, recurrent, support vector machines, or other variants. This page only describes how our algorithm detects unanticipated types of loss so far as to prevent potential issues in this process later. Also note that there's plenty of material elsewhere about the exact details of how neurons work which may greatly affect where your mind might turn first when facing questions about the brain, how the human brain generates itself? So don't worry too much about understanding things here just yet! There are several references below which should give you greater insight into what exactly our method is doing, along with examples where the model performed exceptionally well in comparison to past models even though the same models used could do better…just check out many examples in our repository from experiments across different fields you're probably more interested than I am in.

    "Abstract\n\nThe idea that balls of gold are placed in the air to help predict elections is a modern mystery. What we propose is the existence of \"formal balls\" in which a few gold balls with a fixed probability for the election win are placed in the air. This conjecture follows from the empirical observation that the probability of the election win varies between individuals. The idea was tested by playing the election prediction game in a laboratory setting and comparing the results with those obtained in a real world election.\n\nWe found that, in a real political setting in a non-optimal setting with a low expected vote fraction, the probability of election win was determined solely by the performance of the individual, which follows from the fact that political success depends on relative performance. In other words, there were no formal balls. What we call a \"formal\" ball is one in which the performance of the individual is expected to matter, and we measure the probability of win by subtracting the apparent probability of victory from the true probability. This formal ball has a fixed probability of win, as the votes of a few individuals would produce a low probability.\n\nTo show that this is right, we also showed that individual votes are not independent; that the performance of individual voters depends on the performance of each of their individual neighbors as well. In the absence of formal balls, the vote of one voter would have no impact on the probability of any other voter's win; however, on a formal ball, individual vote results would only be determined according to the performance of neighbors who are connected with that voter, so the total vote of a single voter could influence the performance of many neighbors.\n\nThis proposition has implications for elections in non-optimal settings. In the ideal political setting, the expected performance of voters is fixed; with a ball, however, a few votes can determine the result of the race. The implications are that in an election in which the performance of one or few candidates differs substantially from one another, voters may have different expectations about how their individual actions will yield an expected outcome. If there are a large number of competing candidates, this means that voters cannot be sure that their votes for their favorite candidate will influence the results enough to make a statistically significant difference. In a state with a large number of candidates, or with large population sizes, voting system reform may be a reasonable target",
    "Abstract\n\nThis paper presents an evaluation framework for type theory that allows us to normalise types and evaluate them at different levels of abstraction. The framework is based on the idea that we can define a type as a set of values (or functions) with some properties, such as being non-empty or having a finite number of elements. We then use this definition to construct a new type which has these same properties but also satisfies certain additional constraints. This new type is called a refinement of the original type. In particular, it is possible to apply the same rules to both types, so that they are equal under evaluation. The framework is motivated by the fact that many languages have a notion of equality, but do not allow us to express it using only equality operators. For example, in Haskell, equality is defined using ==, but in C++, equality is defined using operator==. However, there is no way to express equality using only equality operators. A similar situation exists in other programming languages, where equality is expressed using == and!=, but not using any of the standard equality operators. This means that we cannot write programs like: int x = 1; if (x == 0) { // OK } else { // ERROR! } In order to solve this problem, we introduce a new concept of equality, which is defined using the equality operators == and!=. These operators are used to compare two values, and their semantics is very simple: if one value is greater than the other, then the second value must be less than the first. If one value is less than the other, then the first value must be greater than the second. Thus, the equality operators provide a convenient way to express equality between types. However, the equality operators are not sufficient to express equality between types. To see why, consider the following program: int x = 1; if (x == 0) { // OK } else { // ERROR! } The above code will fail because the comparison operator == does not return true when comparing two values of type int. Instead, it returns false. This is because the comparison operator == compares two values of type bool, whereas the comparison operator!= compares two values of type int. Therefore, the comparison operator == should always return false when comparing two values of type bool. However, this is not what happens in practice. Consider the following",
    "Abstract Cross-Denoising Networks on MedImage Segmentation The application of cross-domain networks to medical image segmentation involves classification of objects and localization across images using machine learning methods applied over different types of features, such as feature maps or pixel intensities. To achieve this feat our approach begins by determining the relative locations of two classes as classes which are then placed as the edges between them in the space containing all class distinctions defined with features (e.g., class labels or class boundaries). This spatial position defines an object category that identifies its object category and represents the difference of classification. We present a novel framework for performing cross-domain network inference given that the training data may contain either objects or classes as components. We exploit this structural difference to define an agent using a mixture of both feature vectors and target features. Using this representation enables us to perform cross-domain weighting over a high dimensional latent semantic content so that classification errors are minimized while preserving accuracy. The proposed architecture takes advantage of the existing structure of MEDCIK (Microarray Classification and Kinetic k-sorting of Images) dataset so we evaluate its performances in a clinical scenario using 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets extracted from clinical database sources. For each input image an instance representation of the mediastyle and the patient's face is constructed that is assigned randomly based on a known pre-training set of class assignments. This leads the network to find class distributions among other images such that the classification error falls below 5%. A subset of these resulting samples are combined into a new multisampled vector that represent each of the mediastyles, including the patient's visual information contained within the underlying images. From these new examples the network returns a class label associated with the target features. The algorithm uses an iterative optimization process where more than 50 targets must be learned before achieving optimal results. Our model supports multiple types of class assignment and the network includes one special case for detecting object categories identified through noise as opposed to a discrete value of \"object category\". Additionally, we include a discriminability feature where it can distinguish between classes that fall along arbitrary classes boundaries such as from the medimedicine-specific classifications. Together with prior work published on cross-domain reinforcement learning via gradient descent with hidden units, our technique provides novel",

They have also scored just 15 goals across those four matches as more attention turns towards Manchester United and City for next season.\n\nSpeaking ahead of his side's trip to Sunderland, Martinez said: 'If there are people saying we are in crisis, then you don't look at our achievements, you only analyse things from outside.'\n\n'I've always believed if anyone puts us under pressure we always respond, and obviously it didn't happen (against Everton) so that means these rumours we hear about us in crisis are true,' he added.\n\n'There will be a bunch of clubs who watch our progress because our first job was not to leave here or finish sixth in the division but stay up, put distance between ourselves and every other team in England.'\n\nWenger claimed last month that he had doubts about whether Chelsea could become champions again, while manager Rafa Benitez believes Chelsea still possess good players who require development.

    "Two weeks out from an election, Conservative and Labour supporters have made more than £250m in combined donations across their political parties last month, official figures showed today. Since the start of October when Tony Blair announced his intention to stand down as prime minister, each side has pulled in almost exactly what it put into campaign coffers before the year began.\n\nIf you don't remember what happened just before November 22nd 2003 you are living under a rock. It's amazing how much money we, as a nation have squandered on useless parties that are incapable of winning, or worse they can become major players in government - something people should be proud of but which, like most governments, just looks foolish because of their complete abdication to responsibility for the security of our country (not to mention their inability to win elections). That said while this may have only been part 1 of two parts I'll try my best to list every single thing that was wrong in UK politics then and has gone wrong since. The first one being the lack of personal accountability by both major party leaders. The politicians who were elected could do absolutely nothing right so why did anyone believe anything they said? The second part being both major parties (Labour & Tory) having failed electorally so who would want to vote for them again if given the chance? I'm not sure what point the next paragraph is supposed to make but anyway: After 10 years of Tory rule, there is finally hope for Britain. Last week, Ed Balls won the biggest parliamentary shock the country had ever seen with victory at the general election... As Balls told reporters this morning he intends to lead the Labour Party after the next election.... While he doesn't say outright he will serve beyond May 2020, any sense within Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet today that he might go on past February 2019 is now over.",

    "David Cameron has unveiled his first major budget since becoming Prime Minister, promising to spend £12bn on new schools and hospitals as he tries to revive Britain's economy. The Chancellor George Osborne will unveil his own plans for an extra £3bn in spending next month, but Mr Cameron said it was not enough to reverse the economic decline that has seen unemployment hit 10 per cent. He also pledged to cut taxes by £10bn over five years. In a speech at the Mansion House in London, Mr Cameron promised to invest more than £1bn in new schools and hospitals, including £500m for a new hospital in Manchester. But he warned that the country would have to make do with less money if it wanted to get back into surplus. 'We are going to be borrowing again,' he told reporters after the speech. 'But we're going to borrow wisely.'\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, it means that the UK government is planning to increase its deficit by £2 billion (or 2% of GDP) in 2013-14. This is because they want to spend more money than they take in. They are trying to balance their books by increasing their debt.\n\nThis is exactly what happened during the last recession. When the US Federal Reserve started printing money, the British government increased its debt by £5 billion. And when the European Central Bank began buying bonds, the UK government increased its debt by £6 billion.\n\nIn other words, the UK government is now attempting to repeat the same mistake that the US and EU did. It wants to print money to pay off its debts. However, unlike the US and EU, the UK government doesn't actually need to raise any additional revenue to fund these deficits. As long as interest rates remain low, the government can continue to print money without raising taxes or cutting spending.\n\nAnd this is why the UK government is so desperate to keep interest rates low. If interest rates rise, then the government will have to start paying higher interest payments to investors who bought the bonds issued by the government. That will force them to sell those bonds at a loss, which will reduce the amount of money available to pay down the government's debts.\n\nAs I've written about previously, the UK government is currently holding around £1 trillion worth of debt. So even if interest rates were to rise to 4%, the UK government could",

    "A US government report has sparked fears that the world's biggest economy could be heading for another recession, with economists warning that it will add to pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year. The Commerce Department said on Friday that consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in April, the smallest rise since October 2009 and well below analysts' expectations of a 0.3 per cent increase. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 per cent rise. Prices were up 1.1 per cent over the 12 months through March. The figures come as the Fed prepares to meet next week to discuss whether to start raising interest rates. The central bank last raised its benchmark rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the report was released, while stocks fell.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, if you are an American who believes that the U.S. economy is going to continue growing at a healthy pace, then this should not worry you too much. However, if you believe that the U.S. economy is headed into a recession, then this should cause concern.\n\nFor example, if the U.S. economy continues to grow at 2% or less, then we would expect to see unemployment rise significantly. If the unemployment rate rises above 8%, then we would also expect to see wage growth fall dramatically. This means that the U.S. economy is likely to experience significant deflationary pressures.\n\nIn addition, if the U.S. economy continues to grow at a slower pace than other major economies, then we would expect to see a sharp decline in global demand. In fact, if the U.S. economy grows at only half the rate of other major economies, then we would expect to see a drop in global GDP of around 3%.\n\nIf the U.S. economy continues to grow at a lower rate than other major economies, then we would expect to see a sharp decline in global demand. In fact, if the U.S. economy grows at only half the rate of other major economies, then we would expect to see a drop in global GDP of around 3%.\n\nThis means that the U.S. economy is likely to experience significant deflationary pressures.\n\nWhat do you think about these predictions?

    "There could be serious problems with the tsunami assistance website which should not automatically be considered aid, despite the claims on relief web pages (see below).

    "Russia formally alleges Yukos shareholder was responsible for the theft of $100bn from Russian treasury\n\nThe company's legal team has accused Yukos' former president Igor Sechin of being the \"driving force\" behind the financial collapse of the company, with allegations that he was the \"principal beneficiary\" of the scheme, in a lawsuit to be brought before a Moscow court. Sechin is a former director of the oil giant Rosneft.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in the Russian Federation's district court of Nizhniy Novgorod against Sechin and four Yukos companies, plus its former shareholders in Russia and abroad, by the Russian corporate liability insurer, Rusnano. The Yukos legal team are representing itself in the case.\n\nYukos, which has long been suspected by many of having been involved in a corruption scheme which led to Russia's biggest ever oil price falls in 2008, claims that he and a co-conspirator – billionaire businessman Maxim Litvinov – were \"the chief architects\" of the so-called \"dirty\" scandal and that the company lost more than $100bn (£70bn) as a result, according to a statement filed in support of Sechin's lawsuit, originally due to be filed by the same court but subsequently delayed pending the Russian government's response. The lawsuit further alleges that in a statement of assets, liabilities and claims against Yukos, Sechin, named as a defendant alongside Litvinov and the four Yukos directors, also played a leading role in the fraud.\n\n\"The Russian regime and its elite have been engaged in a sophisticated and protracted criminal conspiracy that has robbed the country of almost $100bn,\" said Sergei Gorbachev, chairman of the state-backed Moscow Exchange. \"I am confident that today's developments bring justice to the victims.\"\n\nYukes' statement said the company had \"become the only legal means\" of preventing Litvinov's assets being drained and that it would \"take the necessary measures\" to ensure that he did not access assets belonging to the company abroad to \"prevent a transfer of the proceeds of the criminal act to offshore havens, under the guise of overseas assets and trusts\".\n\nThe lawsuit follows a series of moves by Russian authorities which have resulted in foreign companies claiming financial benefits from Russia.

    "A former British prime minister, George Brown, has dismissed warnings about the state of the recovery and predicted that the US economy is on track to grow by 1.8% this year and 2.2% next, putting it well on the way to its first expansion since 2008. In a BBC interview Brown described the US economy as \"doing pretty well\", and said that UK unemployment is on track to end this year at five-and-a-half million. \"I wouldn't go outside the front door with too much confidence unless the US economy is hitting its target,\" Brown told the BBC's Today Programme. \"A great deal of effort is being put into avoiding depression and recovery if you're thinking about the future of the global economy.\" At the end of 2012, Brown was the fastest-growing party leader in the House of Commons, according to two YouGov polling companies. Brown said he believed that the political system in the UK was \"not sustainable\", but he added that the country still had a \"dynamic political system, at a time when people have not seen it\". \"We think we can go into 2014 with a little less of this uncertainty than people might have expected,\" he said. \"In some ways I feel there is a greater degree of political stability, I don't see much, if any, fundamental change.\"\n\nAs of September 23, the economy has grown at an average rate of 1.4% for the first three months of the year, according to the Commerce Department.\n\nThe country currently has 1.2 million more jobs than at the end of 2007.\n\nThe BBC reported that Britain is doing better than people realize by many standards.\n\nIf every household had a net worth of US$80,000, the economy would have an extra US$1.1 trillion this year, and $2.6 trillion over the next four years, according to Brown's estimate.\n\nAs of this writing, David Stockman was unable to find other reliable information about Brown's wealth, or what he has contributed to society in the past 15 years.\n\nUpdate: The original version of this story said that as of September of 2013 the UK economy had increased at 2.2%.

    "BBC Newsnight can reveal that David Cameron has vowed to introduce Conservative plans for an extra £3,000 tax paid by every homeowner with more than four properties. The scheme would also include small business owners - some of whom have been accused of avoiding tax through complex schemes such as offshore structures and partnerships. But Cameron wants to go further and apply a levy on homeowners based in certain areas - such as London - whose property could be worth up to £2m; people who own multiple homes worth over £10m, or those whose main residence is London but not within Greater Manchester; or residents of housing association estates in Wales. That, he said last night, puts Britain \"head and shoulders above anything else in Europe when it comes to how much you pay\". He had previously insisted his idea was \"all about helping people buy the biggest houses they possibly can\", adding that Cameron \"would go back to MPs tomorrow [in October] – there is nothing to stop this going ahead in parliament.\" But his critics say that if Cameron's plans were accepted the government could find itself responsible for providing around 50% of new housing investment projects in areas where many will lose out. Ed Miliband told parliament yesterday that those who supported the principle of the change should vote against them in next month's council-election elections. A Labour spokesman described the proposal as \"unfairly damaging\" and said local authorities were already struggling to deal with major house price growth. As part of his campaign promise to tackle housing affordability, he announced a £23bn package to build thousands of new homes at low cost in inner cities including Birmingham, Cardiff, Leicester, Liverpool, Norwich, Sheffield, Warrington, Wakefield. Tory chief strategist Lynton Crosby claimed the proposals would do just what the prime minister wanted to achieve: encourage home ownership in the most expensive parts of England, which he argued was essential in tackling unemployment and high inflation. It would also hit those who chose not to rent a property because of its large size. Cameron made the announcement two days after he confirmed that George Osborne will publish on Monday new cuts to corporation tax rates – but not income tax. And the chancellor suggested the £25bn fund set up earlier by Alistair Darling may yet disappear. The funds were aimed at helping the Scottish economy recover after last year's independence referendum. Downing Street denied any link between the measures and the election results, saying it had been brought forward as a",

    "Australia's national safety rating was also raised to six stars in an annual report on global security issued by the US government last night. The country retained its highest level of 'excellent' overall, and rated \"fantastic\" for crime, freedom of movement, corruption and respect for human rights in its report card that rates 175 countries. The 2014 Global Challenge Against Nuclear Terrorism was issued yesterday to mark the fifth anniversary of the deadly terrorist attacks on the Japanese city of Tokyo in March 2011, which killed 13 people. The report gave Australia top marks based partly on the strength of our homeland defences with 72 per cent of households having some form of air-defence mechanism. Australians also ranked their home security as among the safest. Australian military personnel are currently on Operation Telaroos in Papua New Guinea guarding against potential drug traffickers crossing over onto Australia's Pacific territory – though there have been no reports so far of drugs reaching this northern border state. According to US Department of Homeland Security statistics, Australians were convicted for terrorism offences more than any other nation measured between 2009/10 and 2013/14, more than double every other western country put together. In 2012 alone, 20 citizens or residents from the United Arab Emirates were sentenced to death, seven from Syria, one each for Iran, Iraq and Pakistan and one each for Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. But Australia has yet to join Syria, whose civil war erupted more than two years ago, in listing on the list of terror states signed up to the International Criminal Court because this would constitute tacit acceptance of their continued atrocities in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Australia signed the UN Declaration on Genocide in 1992. It now supports international talks to make such crimes illegal by signing up to the Rome Statute which imposes an automatic sentence of life imprisonment plus 1.5 years when individuals commit genocide since 1993. Human Rights Watch said governments need to act in the near future to uphold international law that clearly prohibits discrimination and forbids collective punishment for criminal acts when it comes to individuals and groups. One of Australia's closest allies last night criticised Saudi Arabia as a major violator of human rights – and warned Prime Minister Tony Abbott not to allow his country to gain legitimacy while holding its political leaders accountable. Foreign Affairs Secretary Julie Bishop said Riyadh's treatment of female reformers in recent months showed the Saudis were \"in denial about what actually goes on in their country\".",

    "Palestinian economy 'in decline'\n\nA new survey says Palestinian life is becoming increasingly more difficult and says the Palestinian economy has shrunk by 11 per cent in the last year as Palestinian Authority budget cuts stifle the growth of the country's economy, a new report says. The decline, while disappointing – in part because Palestinians are used to a rapid growth trajectory – could signal long-term difficulties for the country. The report was published on Tuesday by the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority's Ministry of Economy and Consumer Protection. With Palestinian officials saying they are concerned by the worsening economic situation and that it could be the second biggest deficit in the country, the report said that growth in 2017 was expected to show a 0.3 per cent rise over 2016. That figure was down from the 0.7 per cent increase recorded in 2016 and 2016 was the first year recorded that the average growth rate stood at 0.8 per cent, which was more than double the 1.1 per cent seen through the previous decade. The latest annual figure was the first fall since 2009. However, a Reuters report released in March said the Palestinian economy grew at a low 0.4 per cent annual rate for the last three years.\n\nThe following are some of the relevant excerpts:\n\n\"The Palestinian economy is in decline,\" said a ministry official, who spoke at the release of the report. Palestinians had spent $2 billion on the food and agricultural sectors in 2016, the report said. But overall, the Palestinian economy is expected to shrink by 11 per cent this year, to $13.1 billion, according to the report, although some analysts have said that the decline is due to the Palestinian Authority budget cuts. \"The Palestinian economy is declining,\" said the ministry official. \"We're in the crisis zone. There are no resources. Our GDP is down 8 per cent. That means that the government budget is down 10 per cent. The public sector is down 5 per cent. All sectors are down.\" \"The ministry is working on improving the situation,\" the official said, adding that the ministry's budget was about $600 million this year. \"The food and agricultural sector has become more difficult. What was easy and profitable five years ago has become more and more difficult. This is especially the case on the Gaza border, where the Palestinian economy has deteriorated in some areas.

    "Google's controversial latest entry into the fast-growing mobile search market has come down heavily on its main competitor, Mozilla on Thursday. When Google announced for the first time that it was building a full mobile search app to compete with the likes of Apple and Microsoft which already run their own smartphones, analysts expected the move to be a blow against Firefox OS as it seeks to convince consumers they should ditch their phones and switch exclusively to an android based ecosystem that provides access to hundreds of thousands of apps, including ones by other companies such as Facebook or Amazon. But rather than being an effective challenge there appears to have been virtually no impact. A survey by online research company Ipsos found only two percent switching to Android and a further 9 percent preferring iPhone. The figures are even lower – 1 percent – when those surveyed were asked which smartphone they would most like to receive an upgrade to because of the shift in operating system preference. And what does all this mean?\"We could see a more difficult time of it going forward,\" says Dave Sutton, director general at Ipsos. \"Android is the biggest market, but at the same time there may well not be any further impact.\" In another sign Google may want to put aside plans to do battle with others on the desktop internet (see http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16181522), he believes Samsung and LG (a top two brand) will hold on to their positions this year despite rising competition from rivals HP, Sony, Acer and Asus among others. Those at least making clear moves towards the open web will be able to hold on to users' goodwill if consumers continue to express interest in alternatives to iOS and Google and continue to buy tablets – something many expect will happen if they feel a competitive alternative presents value. For most businesses though, a major effort to woo customers away from Windows will remain impossible unless it can persuade small firms to give up the tried solution. Even then, some organisations believe the mobile phone world has changed so swiftly - for better or worse - that mobile browsers designed as standalone products are just too late at the starting line.\n\nThe above summary appears to explain why I went looking around the web and why, in my humble opinion, the new IE9+ will not stand toe-to-toe with Safari on iOS (iOS9+ does offer similar features and functionality). It seems almost certain both these new versions",
    "MADISON, Wis. – A veteran Green Bay Packers cornerback could be headed back home for the season after he fractured two bones in his face last week against the Steelers. Defensive tackle B.J. Raji suffered fractures near to his eye at the end of Thursday's 31-30 win over Pittsburgh and will miss the rest of the upcoming games.\n\n\nClyde Brown has missed five training camps with hamstring injuries and will also play on Monday when the Packers host Cincinnati. He will not return until after the Tennessee game, but if Raji misses three of the next four there should not be much need for a fifth starter up front.

    "\"Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has attacked The Guardian newspaper over its reporting after it unearthed damning allegations that Jeremy Corbyn and other Labour figures have been involved in anti-Trident campaigning. Describing The Times' handling of its investigation as \"totally inadequate\", Mr Watson claimed its articles showed collusion between British political parties during last summer's referendum campaign against Britain leaving the European Union. He insisted that the publication of one of their stories could undermine the democratic process leading up to Thursday's triggering of Article 50, and warned that \"the party should not be seen to collude with these people\".\n\nWhile we are unsure why Watson would so vehemently charge our esteemed news outlet with bias for simply investigating an allegation made by the official opposition, he did raise some interesting points regarding media scrutiny – especially when it comes to the EU. Indeed, he was correct in most regards; however there are many issues he failed to adequately consider, including how his own party members feel about all this talk of war funding within Labour. We think your average grassroots Labour activist will be equally unhappy with him charging such a high price for opposing the UK government on all fronts whilst trying to maintain any claim at ALL validity on any topic. This brings us onto the next point…\n\n5) His own party leaders fear the public speaking out too hard. Well they may have realised just how badly Corbyn is being maligned but if Watson wants Labour MPs to be in favour of staying in the EU then presumably he needs to start acting on any concerns they might have of his comments rather than constantly reminding them of what many people in their constituencies believe. So maybe Watson should put more effort into convincing the rank and file Labour MPs who want to remain in Europe to rally round Remain when parliament returns? You see, there ARE some things in life that simply cannot be taken lightly when considering the overall implications they'll inevitably have on future generations. Afterall, the lives we now take part in is the gift to the world and something which we can never undo. We also know that Corbyn is a devout Christian whose religion prohibits anyone from criticizing anything he (or she) holds sacred.\n\nWe mean really … What do you expect from him?\n\nFinal word to @TomDawkins MP. Do the decent thing, go to his backbenchers. Not sure the #DemSoc or Labour leadership could survive this. https://t.co/X",
    "Stan Lee has been called the greatest comic-book writer and artist in history, but he's also one of the most controversial figures in Hollywood. He was born on July 20th, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York, to Jewish immigrants who had fled Nazi Germany. His father was an insurance salesman; his mother worked as a secretary at a bank. The family moved around a lot during the war years, moving from California to Florida, then back to New York again before settling in San Francisco. In high school, Lee met Jack Kirby, who would become his lifelong friend and collaborator. They became friends with fellow comics creators Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, and they all went to the same college, the University of California, Berkeley. After graduating, they decided to go into business together, forming Marvel Comics.\n\nLee began working for Marvel in 1954, when he was just 19 years old. By that time, he already knew how to draw well enough to be hired by them. But it wasn't until later that he started writing stories himself. He wrote the first issue of Fantastic Four (1961) while still in college, and continued to write for the company throughout the 1960s. He also created characters like Spider-Man, Daredevil, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk.\n\nIn 1966, Lee left Marvel to form his own company, which he named after his initials – Stan Lee Enterprises. It was a bold move, since he'd never previously done anything like this. And it didn't work out too well. In fact, it ended up costing him his job.\n\nAfter leaving Marvel, Lee founded another company, Timely Comics, which published titles such as Tales From the Crypt, Weird Science, and others. He also co-created the character Doctor Strange, which he used to create a new universe for Marvel.\n\nBut it was his involvement with DC Comics that really put him on the map. In 1968, he joined forces with writer/editor Mort Weisinger to create the superhero team known as the Justice League of America. This group featured Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, and more.\n\nIt was a huge success, and led to other teams being formed, including the Teen Titans, the Legion of Superheroes, the X-Men, and many more.",
    "A new study has found that people who live in areas with more green spaces and walk to work are less likely to smoke, drink or take drugs than those living in similar areas without such amenities. The research was carried out by researchers at the University of Cambridge and published today in the journal Nature Communications. It suggests that the benefits of walking and cycling can be seen even when it comes to health. Dr David Nutt, Professor of Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, said: \"We know that exercise reduces stress levels and improves mood but we don't yet understand why this happens.\" He added: \"This study shows that there may be an additional benefit for mental wellbeing as well - that being physically active helps us to feel better about ourselves.\" The team analysed data on almost 1 million British adults aged between 18 and 64 years old. They were asked how often they walked to work, whether they smoked, drank alcohol or took drugs, and their level of physical activity. The results showed that people who lived in areas with more green space and walked to work had lower rates of smoking, drinking and taking drugs than those who did not. People who lived in areas with more green space also reported higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction. The findings suggest that the benefits of walking and cycling can be seen even when it comes to health.\n\nI'm sure you'll agree that the benefits of walking and cycling far outweigh any potential negative effects.",
    "Labour and the Conservatives have been told to watch out for what some are calling a \"grey vote\" of voters disillusioned with either major party.\n\nAnd they are concerned that one in five working-class voters could opt not to go to the polling booth at all on June 8th if neither party offers them anything new in this election year.\n\nSources say Labour could see its support slipping by as much as six points compared with the 2010 General Election, while it's predicted Conservative Party support could drop by two. It has also been suggested they might get a boost of 3% from one or other of Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrat counterparts due to their perceived competence and personal popularity.\n\nBut there were fears last night about whether Tories will receive enough votes to win outright, amid uncertainty over David Cameron's future leadership after May 7th. And a growing number of MPs expressed anger at being treated as second class citizens in Parliament, despite having served for decades.\n\n\nOne senior Tory MP said that his constituents would rather not hear that an extra 3% of votes may come their way thanks to the Lib Dems. And another MP added his concern to concerns raised across party lines by several colleagues of Ed Miliband suggesting that in many cases voter apathy was simply because they weren't given a real choice.\n\nThere are even whispers among senior figures inside both Mr Cameron & Co and Downing Street (and on our own site) that many voters who had planned to defect to other parties and abstain to keep the Conservatives afloat at the expense of UKIP may in fact prefer staying true to themselves and supporting the incumbent rather than any of Mr Cameron's rivals.\n\nIf this sounds like crazy speculation, I'm afraid there's no point going into your mind here but you should bear in mind the context of the referendum campaign - the SNP are running an entirely different race now; with the Scottish Independence referendum only months away and the Labour leader (and most important figure within Scottish Westminster) Jeremy Corbyn still unelectable everywhere else apart from Scotland.\n\nSo let me put this bluntly...I think we are just gonna need someone far more competent to run the country than the person who got us into this mess in the first place.

    "A US company has bid to take over the rights to produce and sell the iconic French brand Lacroix, which was founded in 1864 by Louis Lacroix, who died in 1872. The company, called Lacroix International, said it had submitted an offer to buy the brand last week but that no decision had been taken yet. It would be the first time since the 1960s that the name Lacroix would be owned by a foreign company. The company's chief executive, David Gassner, told Reuters he expected the deal to close within six months. He declined to say how much the company wanted for the brand or whether it planned to change its name. But he said the price could reach $1bn.\n\nLacroix is one of the most famous brands in the world, with a long history dating back to the early 20th century. In fact, the brand was created as a way to market the new technology of photography at the turn of the century.\n\nIn addition to being a well-known brand, Lacroix also has a rich heritage. Its founder Louis Lacroix was a pioneer in the field of photographic chemistry, and his work helped revolutionize photography. His invention of the photochromic process allowed photographers to create images that were more vivid than those produced before.\n\nLouis Lacroix was born on January 1, 1834 in Paris, France. He studied medicine and became a physician, specializing in internal medicine. After leaving medical school, he worked as a surgeon in various hospitals throughout Europe. During this period, he developed a fascination with photography and began experimenting with different chemicals to improve the quality of photographs.\n\nHe eventually decided to use these chemicals to develop a process that would allow him to make color prints. This led to the creation of the photochromic process, which enabled photographers to capture colors that were impossible to achieve using natural light alone.\n\nAfter working as a photographer for several years, Lacroix returned home to Paris where he continued developing his processes. He then moved to London, England, where he established a laboratory to further develop his chemical processes.\n\nDuring this time, Lacroix met and married Marie-Louise de la Vallière, a young woman who was studying at the Sorbonne University. They soon had two children together. However,",
    "A Muslim policeman has been hailed as a hero after stopping a man who was allegedly trying to steal his car. The unnamed officer stopped the suspect, who had been driving around with a knife in his hand, and called for backup. He then managed to subdue him until police arrived. The incident happened on Monday night at about 10pm in the town of Al-Quds, north west of Jerusalem. Police said that the driver, a Palestinian, tried to take the vehicle when he saw an Israeli patrol car parked nearby. When the officer approached the car, he noticed it was occupied by two men. One of them was wearing a keffiyeh (Arab headdress) and the other one was carrying a knife. The officer asked the men to get out of the car but they refused. They were both arrested and taken to hospital where their condition was described as serious.\n\nThis is not the first time that a Muslim policeman has saved Jewish lives. In July 2014, a Muslim policeman shot dead a terrorist who stabbed three people near the Old City's Damascus Gate.",
    "A movie machine with 'disturbing content' being sold by an online trader has featured on porn sites and been highlighted widely after it was seized by police during raids in London.\n\nA film titled A Girl Like Me was advertised as if being 'for adults only', but could now be returned to its owner, the Metropolitan Police said today. Detectives spent five months investigating the website and three men they believe made at least £4m selling more than 6,000 copies of the film between 2010 and 2012 via eBay, Amazon and other major websites. The film had previously appeared in cinemas – first as early as February last year and then in March – despite warnings from the BBFC and Google that it could trigger seizures under legislation intended to protect young people viewing films before 16 years. However today the CPS confirmed to bbc.com that officers have decided not charge anyone over the film because any distribution or sale would be contrary to the child trafficking code of practice. In a statement issued yesterday, Det Con Jonathan Spinks explained that because no arrests were made, 'the matter cannot necessarily be pursued in court which would need more evidence'. According to the US law firm Jones Day, the man who bought the computer is thought to live near Manchester and took the item for free using PayPal. When contacted today he declined to comment.

    "Saab to build Cadillacs in Sweden In the Swedish city of Gothenburg, cars made by Saab Motor AB will be built on site after the car company, known in Swedish as \"Saab\", was given permission from Swedish car maker Volvo SE to complete the deal, as reported by news agency TT.\n\nSaab will make 50 Cadillacs in Gothenburg, with more Cadillacs to be built on site later in 2017.\n\nThe company has a car factory in Gothenburg and is currently developing the XC90 model, which was previously dubbed the \"cadillac successor\".\n\nThe new Cadillacs will be assembled by the Saab factory in Gothenburg, the company said.\n\nThe project, announced at a press conference in Gothenburg, is being financed by the Swedish government's development cooperation grants.\n\nThe new plants are estimated to create 890 jobs and will enable the company to expand production in some of its European markets, the company said.\n\nSaab declined to disclose the car manufacturer's value but it said the deal was worth roughly 1 billion kronor (£95m, $130m).\n\n\"Saab has been a national success story not only in Sweden but throughout the world,\" Johan Espen Knudsen, president of Saab, said.\n\nSweden last month unveiled plans to invest up to £300m in up to 100 new factories to cater for a growing demand for high-performance sports cars after being lured by a wave of European investment.\n\nThe budget is in addition to the £11bn the country's government is expected to spend over the next five years on highways and road construction.\n\nThe announcements prompted opposition parties and Sweden's influential business lobby to question Sweden's economic model, which relies heavily on government support.\n\nSweden has also faced a backlash from the European Union over its crackdown on immigration. Last month it joined a row over the construction of a border fence with neighbouring Norway by taking the two countries to court.\n\nIn May, the country was given a warning by a court ordering it to take in a total of 100,000 asylum seekers after some failed to qualify for asylum there.\n\nExplore further: Swedish carmaker has 'cadillac successor'",

    "He has told his party members he will campaign for a \"fair deal\" with its unions and against any change to the rules governing their remuneration, in a blow to leader Ed Miliband over cuts to public sector pay.\n\n\nCara Glen said she would not back Mr Cameron's plan for more junior ministers without guaranteeing them some new pay packet - a demand rejected by fellow shadow minister Chris Leslie who yesterday accused her of being out of touch and claiming only big employers are rewarded on average pay rises. The SNP deputy leader said it was wrong to argue that an unfair financial settlement should be enforced as it affected small businesses and self-employed people who did not own a company or receive government support. She also warned that Tory plans to weaken union influence were threatening Scotland's industrial base. Mr Stewart was forced by his leadership challenger Andy Burnham and backed by his wife Liz, to reverse earlier attempts to distance himself from Gordon Brown's tough budget proposals when confronted recently by a BBC reporter at lunch time at Westminster. He defended his actions, saying the question had been put to him at length ahead of the interview in November, but insisted he still supported Mr Miliband's stance that an economic recovery must follow an anti-austerity agenda. Mr Cameron hit out at those calling for new powers for trade unions after talks about how to avert pension changes collapsed overnight in Brussels and the threat of a Scottish vote on independence intensified, although the prime minister said \"there aren't enough votes in Scotland for another referendum\". Instead, he pledged to consult with MPs and peers before implementing legislation on strike legislation. But senior Lib Dems say George Osborne and Danny Alexander, who both opposed a major shake up in pensions policy, were furious when they heard from Mr Blair during the run up to the referendum on whether the Tories expected him to make a direct intervention after Britain voted resoundingly to remain in Europe.\n\nIn response to this:\n\nGareth Campbell wrote in The Telegraph:\n\nMr Stewart isn't just some hapless wanker, but has held a very serious job within a Cabinet Department for many years. While I suspect Gordon is correct in pointing out that there are too few members in Parliament with large sharesholding companies – I do wonder if the Government might consider a smaller quota for bigger shareholders (i.e. banks) or trading groups such as Goldman Sachs?

    "A new study has found that players are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety if they have been playing for longer than five years, but it's not just the long hours on the pitch which can cause problems. The research also suggests that the mental health issues experienced by professional footballers may be linked to their lifestyle choices. Researchers at the University of East Anglia in Norwich analysed data from over 1,000 former Premier League players who had retired between 2001 and 2010. They found that those who played for 10 or more years were twice as likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety compared with those who had played for less than three years. But the researchers say there could be other factors at play too. For example, some players might have been exposed to traumatic events during their careers such as being involved in car accidents or having close friends die. Others might have developed eating disorders because of stress. And others might have become addicted to drugs like cocaine or heroin. Dr David Stuckler, lead author of the study, said: 'We know that people who have played football professionally tend to have higher levels of physical activity and lower rates of smoking and alcohol consumption.' He added: 'It's possible that these factors contribute to the increased risk of depression and anxiety among former professionals.'\n\nI'm sure you'll agree that this is an interesting finding. However, I think it's important to note that the authors themselves acknowledge that the results are correlational (i.e., they don't prove causation). In other words, we cannot conclude that the fact that players are more likely to develop depression and/or anxiety after playing for a certain amount of time means that playing football causes these conditions.\n\nIn addition, the authors point out that the findings do not apply to all professional footballers. It seems unlikely that the same correlation would hold true for players who only ever played for one club, or even for players who never played any professional football at all.\n\nFinally, the authors admit that the study was limited by its reliance on self-reported information about player health. This is problematic because it makes it impossible to determine whether the reported health status actually reflects actual health status. As the authors write:\n\n'Although our findings suggest that professional footballers are at greater risk of developing depression and anxiety than non-professional footballers, it should be noted that the majority of participants did not report their current",
    "\"On Monday, Moya's record-breaking run ended in dramatic fashion as she was knocked out by Janna, who looked impressive on her return to action. As well as earning an immediate title shot herself, this win also put her in line for another women's super fight later this year.\" In light of this, some fans have expressed their disappointment at Moya losing the match without being able to defend her title – and the decision seems to have divided the fanbase once again,\" says Matt MacGillivray… \"People were disappointed that the UFC didn't hold back when it came time for this fight - given Moya had been out since round one with injury and hadn't fought for almost three months - but I'm not convinced it's something they should be complaining about so quickly after giving Moya the opportunity to do what she does best - fight. We may get one more chance to give Moya more chances in March because Janna will probably go on an extended hiatus before returning around early January, which could cause problems for everyone if they want her back next month or even sooner.\" 'I don't think [Moya]'s upset.' said UFC commentator Brian Stann on The MMA Hour: \"One thing I'm sure Dana White would love to see happen - and you know his wish list usually comes true - is a bout between Miesha and Joanne Calderwood, and you could see why he'd prefer that. But I always thought fighting Moya wasn't an easy task for [Floyd Mayweather Jr.] because I think a lot of people consider Joanne's style very similar [to her own].

    "In Kenya, kids can enjoy games like Angry Birds and Words with Friends while teachers are at work. These mobile gaming consoles allow kids to do what they love on their own time - away from pesky homework – while their lessons take place via Skype or other screen-based technology. One such class uses the tablet game 'Auntie Addict' by iNtourage for its lessons. Kids get to interact with the characters through voice, text and avatar movement - no typing required, it looks like… The games focus primarily on teaching the fundamentals but have some fun extras to look forward too, including the ability to unlock achievements when reaching milestones in the campaign. The teacher and students also keep up with the latest social media trends from around the world, as they use a series of free apps available online. Parents will be pleased to know that not only is class organised using tablets and phones but also provides access to an app store to make sure that everything is fully supported (and available at home too). In another class from the same school another student has embraced this more interactive approach with a game called 'Cricket Keeper'. With both iPad screens turned towards each other, the phone becomes the cricket bat and you move players across the boundaries of boundaries without swinging and misses. A whole class gets hooked! Some might find it ironic though - for all its fun and energy, there's a dark side. Although iPads provide easy access for learning, this means these devices may not be used for tasks that require independent thinking or that involve complex problem solving. It's still early days to tell if such risks hold risk for pupils, as the studies involved aren't yet complete but so far there seems little reason to doubt them... Source",

    "A new ad campaign by Kraft Foods has been criticised as being too aggressive and inappropriate for young viewers, with one parent saying it was 'too much'. The company's latest adverts feature a boy who is told to eat his favourite snacks while watching TV. He then eats them all in front of the camera. One advert shows him eating a bag of chips, another a chocolate bar, and a third a Snickers bar. A spokesman said: 'We're not trying to be overly dramatic or over-the-top but we wanted to make sure that kids could see what they were doing.' But some parents have complained about the commercials, which are part of an advertising campaign called 'Kids Eat Right', because they appear to encourage unhealthy eating habits. One mother, who did not want to be named, said: 'I think it's too much. It's just too much. I don't know how you can do this to your child.' Another parent, who also didn't want to be identified, said: 'It's very hard to watch when you're a kid. You don't really understand why people would put themselves through that. It's like, 'Why am I doing this?''\n\nThis is a perfect example of the way that the media will always try to find something negative to say about anything that happens in our society. This is especially true when it comes to food.\n\nIn fact, if you look at the comments on the original article, you'll notice that many of the commenters seem to agree with the mom above. They feel that the ads are too extreme and unrealistic.\n\nBut let me ask you this question… If you had a son or daughter who was watching these commercials right now, would you tell them to stop? Would you tell them to eat their favorite foods? Of course not! Why would you? Because you love your child and you want them to grow up healthy and happy.\n\nSo why do so many people hate these commercials?\n\nBecause they are realistic. And that's exactly what we need more of in today's world. We need to start seeing things realistically.\n\nAnd that's why I'm going to keep fighting against these ridiculous food advertisements.",

    "It was against that backdrop that the captain of the Moore yacht, Robert Moore, took the unprecedented step of calling for his own dismissal from the British crew of the yacht to which he was travelling as the investigation into allegations of sexual abuse at the club's summer party progressed\n\nThe news comes less than two weeks after one of Moore's accusers, former crew member, Annabelle Lee, claimed that she had been 'blackmailed' by the captain, asking her to return to another night on the yacht.\n\nThere were also claims that Moore had not taken part in the drinks service during the event, despite his wife Gloria Moore's claim that he took part.\n\nSpeaking to the Mirror shortly after the latest allegation against the captain surfaced, a British police officer admitted that there were no grounds for his officers to pursue a manslaughter case.\n\nA member of the British police force's sexual offence and child abuse unit said he would not pursue a manslaughter investigation against Moore, in deference to the fact that the captain has so far denied the allegations all.\n\n\"The police are not prepared to charge the captain based on the available evidence,\" he said.\n\nThat has opened the way forward for the investigation into allegations at the club to continue with the co-operation of British officers on the scene.\n\nThe allegations first came to light in April, after the death of a crewman.\n\nMoore told the Mirror newspaper, that the allegations were \"bull\" that \"need the media to pick up\" saying that a manslaughter case was \"a bit like going after a rugby team after a player is sent off.\"\n\nBut a British police officer told the Mirror that there were no grounds for them to pursue a manslaughter investigation.\n\n\"If there was a clear indication that the crew member had passed away within days of being made aware of the allegations, it would be open to investigators to make a criminal investigation.\n\n\"But we have got no such indication and no one has died.

    "More power is needed to keep nuclear reactors safe - experts today warned, as safety fears over the nuclear industry threatened to make Britain the first country to build new nuclear reactors in more than eight decades.\n\nThe energy watchdog, Ofgem, wants the government to step aside \"for a minimum of five years to introduce new nuclear safety and security standards for new plants\".\n\nThe watchdog's chief executive, Emma Reynolds, said it was \"very important\" to act, following three accidents and a fire at the Sellafield site.\n\n\"Every new plant under construction should have a safety culture that is up to scratch with the current international best practice,\" she added.\n\nBut critics of the government's reliance on nuclear said a failure to invest in new safety standards would be counterproductive.\n\nDavid Pisoni, senior analyst of the Global Nuclear Energy Agency, said: \"Nuclear has now been the least-used energy source in the UK, and is therefore not well-sited for expansion.\"\n\n\"This has led to the current reliance upon the older generation of plants, which is now running at 40 per cent capacity, even as demand for electricity has fallen.\"\n\nSir Graham Walker, former chief of staff to the chief constable of the Met and chairman of the National Audit Office, said: \"Ofgem needs to do what they've promised, not just for UK nuclear but globally.\n\n\"The nuclear industry is facing the kind of problems which have led to the collapse of traditional industries around them.\"",
    "A new study has found that the actor's performance in The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button was not only one of his best, but also one of the most accurate portrayals of autism ever seen on screen.\n\nBenjamin Button, which won an Oscar for Best Picture and a BAFTA for Best Actor, tells the story of a young boy who develops a condition known as Asperger Syndrome after being diagnosed with it at the age of three.\n\nIt follows the life of Ben, played by Hugh Grant, through to his teenage years when he begins to develop symptoms of autism.\n\nIn the film, Ben is portrayed by Andrew Garfield, who has been praised for his portrayal of autistic children in films such as The Social Network and The King's Speech.\n\nBut now researchers have analysed the performances of all the actors who appeared in the film over the course of its production, and concluded that Garfield had performed better than any other actor.\n\nDr David Rutter, from the University of California, Los Angeles, said: \"We were surprised to find that Garfield did so well because we thought he would be more likeable.\"\n\nHe added: \"Garfield is very good at playing characters who are socially awkward or neurotic. He does this really well. But he doesn't do it quite as well as Andrew Garfield.\"\n\nResearchers used data from the Autism Speaks website, which tracks the progress of people with autism, to analyse the performances of all the actors who appeared in the film between May 2010 and March 2011.\n\nThey then compared these results against those of the original cast members, including Grant, who plays Ben.\n\nRutter said: \"Andrew Garfield is a great actor, but he wasn't as good as the others. We think Garfield may have been able to get away with some things because he was younger and less experienced.\"\n\nHowever, Garfield himself admitted that he felt he could have done better.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"I'm not sure I got everything right. There were times where I didn't know what I wanted to say. It's hard to explain. You just don't know how you're going to react until you see it on the big screen.\"",
    "A second judge, Sir Simon Burns, rejected the case and told Mr Wilson that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole was 'unsuitable'. He added: \"To leave open the possibility when this terrible offense took place if there should have been a different offender on sentence would constitute such an open invitation to future evil acts.\" His remarks will be seen as a sign of the increasing reluctance by judges in England not only to jail offenders who were at one time friends but also men considered unlikely ever to hurt anybody again – even if they have a criminal record for a previous offence or two which no longer figure. The court heard that a new victim had come forward with fresh details about how the attack left her fearing the worst after she saw CCTV images which showed her neighbour's friend hitting her three times with the axe just moments before his death. She spoke at length to John Wilson, now aged 41, following the verdict but did not wish to give evidence herself. Miss Oriel said today: \"I don't feel I can go back into my own life. But you never know. All it takes is a little lapse of judgement that he (Mr Wilson) has some issues we haven't heard about yet. \"If he didn't turn up any more than what he did at the start, maybe then we wouldn't hear anything else and say he was involved in those horrible murders.\" Mr Wilson had denied murdering John Wilson, 62, Robert Wilson, 76, Geraldine Smith, 77 and Leslie Chapman, 81 at their properties at Beeston Park Road Levenshulme, Hampshire, on January 20 2002 following an argument over loud music. On Wednesday last week, Judge Mark Brown QC asked a jury, made up of nine women and four men from across England and Wales, whether he properly believed Mr Wilson to still have a moral conscience and whether it was possible he could appreciate both the wrongfulness and unfairness of killing four innocent people. They all convicted him unanimously of manslaughter. At a lengthy hearing, which began yesterday, Mr Wilson had pleaded guilty to murder with diminished responsibility. Before starting on Tuesday afternoon, jurors gave short, detailed judgments, ruling out the prosecution's case that he had not intended to kill. However, because of concerns raised at the beginning, they were able to rule that prosecutors had proven beyond reasonable doubt, based upon a series of \"significant admissions\" by Mr Wilson, as to why he killed:",

The British Army said it would send two battalions of Gurkhas to help in the disaster response. They will join forces with Japanese troops already on the ground. The announcement was made by Colonel Richard Kemp, commander of the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, at an event in London today. He said: 'We are sending two battalions of Gurkhas to Japan to assist with the relief effort.' The battalion will be based in Japan for three months before returning home. It will include around 500 soldiers who have served in Afghanistan. The announcement comes as the Government prepares to announce its aid package for the region. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'It's not just about providing food and water but also medical supplies and other assistance.' The UK has pledged £1 million to the UN World Food Programme (WFP) to provide emergency food aid to those affected by the disasters. The money will go towards helping people in Fukushima prefecture, where more than 100,000 people were forced to flee their homes when the earthquake struck last month.

    "Opera has been accused of being too quiet on its latest release, which was released last week and is now available to download for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The new version, called Opera 12, comes with a number of improvements including support for HTML5 video playback, improved privacy controls and an updated design that makes it easier to navigate. But some users have complained about the lack of updates since the launch. One user said: \"I'm not sure why they haven't pushed out any major features or bug fixes.\" Another added: \"It's like they're trying to hide something.\" Opera's chief executive Lars Boilesen told BBC Newsbeat: \"We are constantly working hard to improve our products and we will continue doing so in future releases.\" He also denied claims that the company had deliberately kept the software under wraps. \"There were no plans to keep this product secret,\" he said. \"This is just how things work at Opera.\"\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, if you've ever used Opera before then you'll know that it's one of those browsers that doesn't really do anything particularly innovative. It's basically just a web browser with a few extra bells and whistles thrown into the mix. So when you look at the above quote, you can see that Opera is saying that it's not going to be pushing out any major changes to the browser. This means that there won't be any big feature announcements coming up soon. However, it could still change over time as Opera continues to develop the browser further.\n\nWhat do you think? Is Opera keeping its mouth shut because it wants to focus on developing other parts of the browser? Or is it simply waiting until it feels confident enough to announce more exciting developments?

    "Motorists are the world's most vulnerable group, a new study has revealed.\n\nThe report, published by travel search firm Expedia, reveals they face up to 10,000 more deaths worldwide before the age of 65 if drivers ignore all traffic rules.\n\nIt also reveals that motorists are more exposed to the dangers of getting into a collision than children.\n\n\nIt also states: \"Nearly 80 per cent of people (75 per cent) would never take an unexpected day off.\"\n\n\"However, half the adult population (48 per cent) would stop for a drink or a bite to eat,\" the study found.\n\n\"This is because, unlike children, individuals who have an opportunity to stop need less motivation to do so.\"\n\nOther areas of the report, which was based on a survey of more than 100,000 people, include:\n\n• 1 in 3 (35 per cent) of drivers have no idea about other road users using safety barriers, such as bollards (26 per cent).\n\n• 28 per cent of people (25 per cent) would travel in dangerous traffic conditions.\n\n\n• 21 per cent of motorists would not drive because of traffic rules – and 16 per cent would do so, irrespective of road conditions.\n\n• 441,000 deaths a year are the result of traffic accidents.\n\n• In 2013, traffic killed an estimated 1.12 million people worldwide, making it the world's fourth leading cause of death.\n\n• Traffic causes over 80 per cent of all road deaths in developing countries.\n\n• In the UK alone, traffic causes an estimated 12,400 deaths per year.\n\nThe study is the first of its kind to investigate the most vulnerable road users, comparing them with the average driver, said Matt Sturgess, chief executive of Expedia Europe.\n\n\"It is clear that many people drive without paying attention to other vehicles and their environment and that, like children, they may experience a temporary feeling of boredom when the road appears to be quiet,\" he said.\n\nThis is not surprising, given they only spend a small percentage of their daily time driving, and that for a car the road is a natural place for exploration, Sturgess told the Financial Times.\n\n\n\"Even a novice driver spends a third of their time sitting comfortably in the driver's",

    "AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A Mexican-American group that has been fighting for more than two decades to legalize gay marriage won its first major legal battle on Friday when a federal judge ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry.\n\nU.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia said he was not convinced by arguments made by opponents who argued that legalizing gay marriage would lead to polygamy and bestiality.\n\nGarcia's ruling came after a three-week trial in which lawyers for the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), which brought the case, presented evidence that gay marriage could be good for children and society as a whole.\n\nGay rights advocates hailed the decision as a milestone in their fight against what they say are discriminatory laws in many states.\n\n\"This is an important day for our community,\" NCLR Executive Director Sarah Warbelow told reporters at a press conference outside the courthouse.\n\n\"We're going to continue to work hard to ensure that all families can enjoy equal protection under the law.\"\n\nIn his ruling, Garcia wrote that while there were some legitimate concerns about the impact of allowing gay marriage on traditional family structures, he found no compelling reason why such marriages should be banned.\n\nHe also noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had already struck down bans on interracial marriage in 1967 and 2003.\n\n\"It seems clear that the Constitution does not require any state to recognize or sanction same-sex marriage,\" Garcia wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in 2008 by NCLR and other groups seeking to overturn California's Proposition 8, which barred gays and lesbians from marrying. The measure passed overwhelmingly in 2004 but was overturned by voters in November 2012.\n\nProposition 8 supporters said it was designed to protect traditional values and prevent the spread of homosexuality among children. Opponents said it was motivated by anti-gay bias.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Kamala Harris, whose office defended Prop 8, called the ruling \"a historic victory for equality.\"\n\n\"Today's ruling affirms that every American deserves the freedom to marry the person they love,\" she said in a statement.\n\nBut opponents of gay marriage vowed to appeal the ruling.\n\n\"I'm disappointed in this decision because I think it will open the floodgates to discrimination against LGBT people,\" said Brian Brown",
    "Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson, MP for Hitchin and Harpenden, has said he is concerned about plans for national ID cards. He said: 'There is no doubt a great deal of work in making a national ID card should be undertaken, but that work should be undertaken in a fully thought through and democratic process. \"Those who want it should be forced to stand for election to it. \"Those who don't want to accept its validity must be required to prove that they fit within the definition of a British citizen. \"The government's proposal seems designed to ensure an election without challenge and in a way that the most regressive elements of the Conservative Party could be reassured about their support for ID cards.\"\n\nThat news article has been shared over 1,900 times since it appeared on May 17th.\n\nDespite Alan Johnson's objection, the government has confirmed the idea of compulsory ID cards and a national ID database. The plans will be submitted for government approval within months.\n\nWhen the BBC contacted the Home Office in early August, the only comment they received was \"we will be considering the concerns set out in the Newsnight programme\".\n\n\"This is all part of making sure that we have strong identification systems for both businesses and people,\" said the Home Office spokesman.\n\nThe Newsnight programme was based on a BBC TV investigation entitled 'The ID card's coming'.\n\nFollowing the news report was released, the BBC's business and technology correspondent, Simon Gompertz, noted that the Department for Work and Pensions has since defended its controversial plan saying that \"the main objection to a national ID card from the government is that it might just result in a state of affairs in which people have to prove who they are because they've been forced to fill in a form\".\n\nAs we noted in our original article, there is a problem with whether they are forced to prove they were born in the UK.\n\nIn the world of free market fundamentalism, the idea of a national ID isn't the problem, it's the fact that one person's idea of a national ID will likely be different than a different person's idea of a national ID.\n\nIn his comments on the Newsnight programme, Gompertz said:\n\nAs a British citizen, what I'd object to is a system where I get the ability to prove who I am",
    "\"Blues fans were disgusted after their side's home game was played behind closed doors at a Blackburn Rovers match venue, with Blackburn player Stephen Clarke allegedly abused by a large section of the travelling support... \"At 2.07pm while the game with Barnsley was still going on in the away end at the Ewood Park Stadium, Clarke was shown a yellow card for elbowing Bolton Wanderers supporter Stephen Green, after which the crowd began to jeer and shout abuse towards him,\" added the report. \"It was shortly before 2.50pm, when the game ended 2-2, that Clarke was subjected to a standing ovation by his own side fans, who chanted 'Stephen, Stephen, Stephen!' and the home fans were heard to howl with approval.\"\n\n\nThe official statement on the Bolton Gazette website was a bit more diplomatic, but said what I wanted to hear: \"A crowd of around 200, mostly Blues fans from England, Ireland and the Middle Ages, made their presence known on the pitch during the last few minutes of the game for the visit of Blackburn [sic] to Ewood Park and began chanting \"Stephen, Stephen, Stephen!\". \"The majority of the crowd of supporters then broke away and went to a stand behind the Blackburn forward, whilst others began abusing him as well as other of our players. \"The players, who had been told of the abuse towards Clarke by one of the referee's assistants when he turned up to the match, decided to stand firm and continued to play the game.\"\n\nWhat happened today was an outrageous abuse of Clarke and other players on his own side by a group of unruly Blackburn-supporting fans, but that was before the match against Millwall was even over. Now, I was at the previous Ewood Park match between Millwall and Blackburn, and even without that incident there's something seriously off about the crowd, a group of mostly young men who seemed to be almost drunker and more drunk than the players themselves.\n\nBut, that wasn't the full story, unfortunately, because the Blackburn people went to the other Ewood Park game and it was even worse -- at least the match with Everton fans was still held behind closed doors so I'm sure those boys would have gotten what they deserved.\n\nIt's a fact that as a professional footballer you want to play in front of your own fans and",
    "'It was very unprofessional,' one player involved told Belgian media. 'They've taken off their gloves and now it's like a boxing match.' Another said: 'There wasn't even the slightest hint of protest or frustration.' The players believe the manager did it because the three-day trial was cancelled during the night before an important World Cup qualifier against Israel last Wednesday - as the squad went to bed - and they had not been paid for more than six hours, despite already having played in two games on Tuesday. There were five teams in training that morning and the first session finished at 11pm but nobody bothered to show up again until midnight, when all those who weren't ready to sign up left with no money in reserve. They also found out later that any player still wanting to come could pay $70 instead of just one week's wages. After what happened, Van Gaal has admitted that he was worried about how this would play out, even if it was only a trial. He decided to give the squad time off again and gave them another week to get their act together, making sure that they understood why. But it meant that the players ended up leaving in tears by noon Friday at the latest after Van Gaal told everyone there where they wanted to go. In case anyone is unaware, we're referring here to Belgium and to Ben Davies, Luke Shaw, Marouane Fellaini, Morgan Schneiderlin, Bastian Schweinsteiger (and Michael Carrick) and Ander Herrera for Holland who have left since these reports went public yesterday afternoon. The story comes amid ongoing tensions between both sides surrounding a salary-free playing budget planned into next season, and even before the recent decision to postpone Saturday's game in favor of Saturday's friendly at Switzerland and the possible departure of goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen for injury reasons. What are your thoughts on this?\n\n\nPosted By PSmooth : Sat Apr 13 00:17:43 2009 Posts 853 Comment From: Paulinho @ 7/14/2009 12:47 PM\n\nHey man. That story sounds rather bad...how can you tell if an international team is going through something bad? You'd need to know when a team actually does something bad. Or did something good happen over the course of this World Cup but when they won it is over? Also, I haven't seen anyone talk about the USA getting kicked out from qualifying",
    "It was another grim record month for trade in the US, as imports and exports saw the US trade deficit soar to nearly half a trillion dollars for the month of March (a total of $500 billion in 2004). Imports slipped by $40 billion from $475 billion last month to $457 billion last month to reach their lowest on record. This comes after the March trade deficit had peaked at $630 billion at the start of the year. The biggest loser was the car sector, which suffered the biggest decline since September 1991 when prices collapsed following the start of the oil crisis. The car sales slump - down by 32.5% from the start of 1992 - also caused production to decline by 27% from its April baseline, according to the National Auto Dealers Association. Imports also dropped by a greater share of what American consumers were buying, with goods purchased by car-loving Americans decreasing from 54.8% of total sales to 52.7% in March, according to the trade publication Auto Sales Information Services. This comes after some of the worst years of the recession saw car sales fall by 50% from December 1989 to November 1990. On the export side, exports of non-oil products are also declining by 5.3% from the corresponding month last year. The decline in exports is attributed to weakness in emerging economies like Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, while the US exported just 2.9% of the products it bought - down 18.8% from last year's levels. The US exported an estimated $3.2 billion worth of autos, $1.6 billion worth of machinery and 4.3 billion pints of beer in March. In terms of food, exports were down slightly at $2.7 billion, with beef, pork and poultry slipping out of the top 15 groups of goods that the US imported. \"The bottom line: the US trade deficit is shrinking by about $100 billion annually, and there's a substantial risk this trend could continue,\" says Jim Dettmer of the Congressional Budget Office.",
    "CALGARY, June 27 (TIMES) - After more than 2-1/2 months of debate, political leaders and industry activists came together Tuesday morning to endorse and fund a new oilsands oil pipeline that would reduce tanker traffic in Canadian waterways. Alberta Premier Alison Redford, Prime Minister Stephen Harper and former premier Jim Prentice signed a deal for Enbridge Corp's Northern Gateway Project with U of A president Robin Campbell. The new pipeline project would connect Western Canada's oil sands to the East Coast via a proposed terminal. With its approval by government officials late Monday night, more signatures were on the petition calling for its development by Enbridge than all previous calls combined. It now needs only about 200 more signatures to qualify as an official referendum or to compel the province to hold one. The agreement comes four days after Enbridge unveiled its proposal to pipe tar sands crude from northern Saskatchewan through two pipelines to market, which opponents say will worsen existing environmental threats because it pumps millions of litres of bitumen diluted with sand into pristine watersheds along the way.\n\nOn Monday night, during a speech at Calgary's Stampede Festival, Prime Minister Thomas Mulcair said he had long supported Keystone XL. Today, he reiterated his belief that any action by the United States would not result in a sudden reversal of American public opinion towards the building of this project.\n\n\nBut Mr. Trudeau seemed to walk back Mr. Mulcair's remarks over the weekend while discussing Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain expansion when it may lead to the passage of a moratorium in BC, but not the rest the country. Here are comments taken from a CBC news piece about it, titled \"Federal NDP leader says Keystone XL won't get green light until Ottawa steps up\":\n\nThomas Mulcair told reporters yesterday that Canada shouldn't approve a pipeline unless there is greater pressure from other provinces. \"I support both Kinder Morgan and Keystone XL … if we have that much evidence against either one of them then I'll do what every member of Parliament who has been involved in this issue was elected to do – I'm going back to Ottawa,\" he added.\n\nSo he's apparently saying what the Prime Minister said last Friday, but has now walked down again after saying it all the time. On Wednesday, the Prime Minister went on the record and offered some additional reasons why Keystone XL would NOT be approved before the fall federal election, but did nothing to stop",

    "Rugby icon Gordon Reid has joined an established list of international stars who have retired in recent months, but he fears that Scotland could once again be plunged into darkness as they prepare to host New Zealand on Sunday afternoon. The veteran lock cited the death of Scotland's last ever Test captain and skipper, Jim Hamilton at the age of 39 shortly before England's ill-fated series against Wales in 2005 when considering his own decision to hang up his boots at the end of last season.\n\n\nIn January that year, Rugby World Cup runner-up and former Springbok loose forward Roger Bannister - widely regarded as one of professional sport's finest players - was found dead after crashing his car into a tree while returning home from a wedding reception. It took less than three weeks for the sport to go through two major tragedies within four years, although many blamed this in no small part on England coach and former All Blacks coach Graham Henry's tough talk at the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia.\n\n\nI think it would shock a lot of people here what Gordon said about it. He had done great things during his career and there are lots of fantastic players out of this country - they've got a good group. They just need to get themselves together and take it game by game, rather than talking rubbish and creating problems in other countries David Smith Head Coach, Cardiff Blues\n\nAnd former international prop John Kirwan died in April 2006 from complications arising from multiple sclerosis, aged 48. A few weeks later Wales beat England 30-0, having been beaten 9-7 for more territory in 2010. The most surprising part of the story is that neither incident seems to rank among his list of achievements: it doesn't come even close. Even so, Kirwan does look back fondly upon playing alongside some of his Welsh and Irish contemporaries; including Mike Phillips and John Davies, who both made their All Black debuts against the British & Irish Lions earlier this month. In particular, Kirwan hopes that young George North can help restore pride in one of the most successful era within the current Welsh set-up between 1988 and 2000, the likes of George Williams, Andy Roberts and Andrew Little representing a generation born alongside him. \"With a large amount coming up from younger guys like George,\" the ex-Ospreys player says today, \"we are still really proud of what we achieved.\" 'Let's win",
    "The \"unusual hearing\" today, which heard from prosecution and defence in a retrial, heard from four former team officials in a bid by the Crown to prove Mr Hatfield and four other men, including team owner Graham Sharpe, took the £9.8m. He had admitted failing to pay £900,000, to settle a dispute over the club's finances with a group of shareholders. The Crown is seeking a further penalty of £1m. Mr Hatfield, along with Sharpe, is also on trial in Dublin, and is accused of concealing financial irregularities in the club and his purchase of it in 2002. All four men deny all the charges. Mr Hatfield, 50, is on trial at Dublin's Circuit Criminal Court on charges of misusing his position of trust. Prosecutors have submitted two books – one on Hatfield and one on Mr Sharpe – as evidence in the case. The defence team has been attempting to introduce two books, one on Mr Hatfield, and one on Mr Sharpe, as evidence.\n\nSo, is it fair to say that the \"special meeting\" is taking place in a court that was a venue for a financial fraud and cover-up?\n\nIt's hard to tell, but the headline might just be accurate:\n\nThe news seems particularly notable when you remember that, just a few months ago, we reported about an insider \"re-opening\" of the \"fraud\" case against Paul Ince and the \"fraud\" and \"carcinogen\" scandal against Gary Bowyer and Michael Thomas. While it won't change the judge's initial conclusions, it certainly lends credibility to the evidence put forward in court.\n\nHowever, the fact that Judge O'Hagan decided to move the original trial to Dublin (a rather convenient location in his mind, one would assume) does raise some questions. Who, exactly, is making the decision on where the trial will take place? I've reached out to the judge for comment and will update the story in the near future.\n\nEither way, the fact that this story has gone public on the Internet is an odd way for the story to end.\n\nHere's the story as it appears in the Irish National newspapers:",

    "A public exhibition of the work of Sir Winston Churchill has been held in London, as part of an effort to mark his 100th birthday. The event was organised by the National Portrait Gallery and the British Museum. It featured portraits of Churchill taken over the years by various photographers, including some who were not even born when he became prime minister. The exhibition included photographs of Churchill's mother, Lady Randolph Churchill, and his father, George VI, as well as those of other members of the royal family. The gallery said it hoped the display would help people understand how important Churchill had become to Britain during its darkest days. The exhibition also showed images of Churchill's wife Clementine, his son Edward, and his daughter Margaret. The exhibition will be on view until September 30.\n\nThis is a very interesting story. I have never heard of any such thing happening before. However, there are many stories about Churchill being photographed that do exist. One of them is this one:\n\nChurchill's portrait was painted by John Everett Millais, who was commissioned by the Duke of Wellington to paint him after the Battle of Waterloo. He was given £1,000 (about $2,500 today) to complete the painting, which took two months to complete. When it was finished, Churchill was so pleased with the result that he asked Millais to paint him again. This time, however, he wanted a more realistic portrait. So Millais went back to the drawing board and came up with a new design. His original idea was to depict Churchill as a young man, but Churchill insisted that he should look older than his actual age. After much debate, the artist agreed to portray Churchill as he looked at the end of World War II. In order to achieve this effect, Millais used a technique called 'negative' photography. This meant that instead of using light to create the image, he used dark shadows to make the subject appear aged.\n\nSo what does all this mean? Well, if you want to know more about Churchill's life, then you can read my book entitled \"Winston Saves the Day\". But if you just want to see some pictures of Churchill, then here they are:",
    "Retailers will open Christmas stores on Thursday, bringing an end to the long-held tradition of Christmas in November as consumers prepared to buy traditional gifts for loved ones.\n\nThe US Retailers Association (URA), who have the lead role in organizing Christmas in November, have announced that they won't be able to open stores on November 23rd and they want shoppers to take this as a moment to make sure the stores open on Thanksgiving Day instead.\n\nRetailers have asked consumers this winter that, \"For the first time this year, celebrate both Thanksgiving and Christmas in your holiday shopping.\" The Retailers Association and URA agreed on this in January of 2013.\n\nHowever, with retailers reporting weak sales in 2013 and fewer consumers willing to spend on holiday gifts, the retailers are planning on using the first day of November to open their holidays on the 25th.\n\n\"Some of our retailers are open just on the third Friday of November which is usually the busiest shopping day of the year, which we had the unfortunate problem of opening on the wrong day. We don't recommend that you do that,\" URA president and CEO Greg Foran, said.\n\nRetailers have tried to move holiday shopping back to November, but consumers are taking advantage of Thanksgiving in some places and even staying late, even making special trips to the store.\n\n\"Now that we are opening on Thanksgiving we feel that we are taking it back a little bit. But in all fairness to our retailers, we do encourage customers that you shop a lot between Thanksgiving and the end of December in order to maximize your savings this year,\" Mr. Foran stated.\n\nRetailers say that opening on the 25th will save retailers more than $1 billion annually and will help them be more competitive in the holiday shopping season.\n\n\"It's like the old adage; if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck; it probably is a duck,\" said Steven Schoch, executive director of Retail Management and Consultants America.\n\nAt the end of 2013 Christmas sales were the lowest in history. This year is not expected to be any better. According to a report released last week, holiday spending will be just $56 billion, meaning that the lowest holiday in history will likely happen this year.",

    "The US Department of Transportation is investigating how American Airlines' computer system is allowing passengers at Newark Liberty International Airport to board planes and change reservations without clearance from controllers – after airlines were forced to cancel more than 800 flights after a computer glitch.\n\nThe investigation could lead to civil fines for American Airlines.\n\n\"It is too early to tell what, if any, impact, if anything the investigation may have on the status of the investigation,\" US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told a news briefing during a visit to Washington DC, adding he will have more to say later. \"I'm looking forward to hearing more tomorrow.\"\n\nHe said the Department of Homeland Security, which is leading the investigation, will be \"making the decision on fines and what they consider appropriate\".\n\n\"I look forward to us having further discussions with the National Transportation Safety Board,\" Mr Foxx said, adding: \"I know they're working tirelessly to try to look for answers. Because I think they have a great deal of people working with them.\"\n\nThe investigation stems from reports that American Airlines was allowing passengers to change flights on its US domestic network and US international route without clearance by US air traffic controllers, which a number airlines said led to passengers getting off flights when they should not have been able to.\n\n\"We believe that we were made aware of it yesterday by some of our airlines and they're conducting their own investigation,\" Mr Foxx said. The situation was being \"managed at a high level\" at American. The department will wait for the board's findings, he added. Airlines said that all tickets for cancellations and adjustments were cleared with the airlines before passengers changed the flights.\n\nAn American Airlines spokesman said an announcement on the company's website on Wednesday morning had stated the airline had \"implemented additional and very specific procedures\" to ensure that all passengers on its domestic network were informed that changes without clearance from the system's operators, which operate under contract to the government.\n\n\"We continue to operate normally and are fully committed to provide passenger service,\" the spokesman added. American said it had made adjustments to systems that manage reservations, ticketing, flight departure and arrival times so that all reservations were routed appropriately and flight information could be updated without any interference.\n\nFAA spokeswoman Elizabeth Cory said that the agency has been notified about the allegations and that the incident is being investigated.

    "\"I can't believe Carroll was there. Carroll looked like he thought the ball was out of his hand and took a shot that didn't go in. He took it off his hands, got touched, I think there was a celebration afterwards because it was a huge call. I knew it was offside but that ball was not in our end - he's a player who has tried to hit us all season. He took a shot and I never thought the play was offside.\"\n\nThe following is the full text of an article from the Los Angeles Times:\n\n\"The goal was offside because, the officials claimed, the ball deflected off Marsch's left foot and bounced up in the box off Carroll's boot. (Marsch had no choice but to bring the rebound to his feet and shoot and not cross to the back post where Carroll could have tried to clear.) It was the fifth ball off the foot of a United player at the goalline through a first period that has led to United goals. It was also the first time this season that United has allowed a goal off such a play. In the first half, Seattle's Jack Jewsbury drew a penalty when he touched the ball inside the box in the third minute. In the second half, United's Kevin Harmse had a long ball bounce off Michael Parkhurst's leg when he was brought down by Carroll. Then, in the 85th minute, a bouncing free kick from a few yards wide of goal was tipped over the crossbar by United defender Taylor Kemp, who was whistled for kicking the ball. \"I don't think any of it would have happened had he (Carroll) not taken the shot. He's a player who has tried to hit us all season,\" United coach Mike Petke said. \"It's not like we have a guy in his 40s who is putting up the same numbers.\" Carroll, the league's leading scorer with 22 goals this season, left the court to a round of applause from many of his teammates. During the break, he said it was the fourth ball to cross the line that season. \"I don't understand,\" said teammate Nick DeLeon. \"I don't ever want to hear that from somebody.

    "In another setback to the Ferguson camp, Juventus have revealed today that they will not be signing up Manchester United's expensive starlet Michael Keane by offering €100k (around £85,000) a year.\n\nUnited manager Sir Alex Ferguson revealed to journalists that he was looking to add someone big to his squad, and had targeted the United midfielder to replace Rio Ferdinand. However, Keane is keen to move to the Serie A club AC Milan where he would be reunited with new Milan boss Silvio Piola from his time at Juventus.\n\nThe 26-year-old is being touted by Ferguson as a possible replacement for Rio Ferdinand and is considered one of his best squad players. But now the Old Trafford club are having to rethink that decision, not having any concrete bids received for the Irish international.\n\nIt is understood that Keane's price tag in Italy is €100,000 (£85,000) a year and there are now plans to look at other players who could potentially replace Fergie's preferred option, such as Arsenal midfielder Paul Scholes.\n\nIt should be noted that Milan manager Silvio Piola took a less lavish approach to negotiating his first contract than Ferguson.\n\nPiola, who managed in Italy for over four years with Juventus, made a new deal possible by agreeing a salary of €800,000 (£620,000) a season with the Serie A outfit. However, there have been reports that Ferguson was unwilling to pay £1million for a first-choice coach under the current transfer window rules.\n\nUnited would be liable to pay an initial £8million if they sign Keane but Piola could cut their bill by offering less cash back in the form of incentives.\n\nKeane's future is unclear for the moment but Ferguson would surely rather play him in the United midfield than put his trust in another midfielder, such as a Scholes, and risk him turning out to be less than spectacular.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Sport_Witness\n\nSource: bbc.com\n\nRelated\n\nArticle by Colin Young",
    "Telcos are fighting over the new Sky+ pay-tv deal because it provides no guarantee on future rights deals - meaning that consumers could be paying up to £150 for less popular sports with more channels if they do not keep switching. Telco executives argue that Sky is seeking unfair favours after the two agreed to scrap the previous Sky TV package and bundle Sky's basic service, Sky Go with its more valuable premium channel. They say that as soon as customers sign on for Sky+, their only option will be the new Sky Pay-TV plan, which means paying extra for fewer channels to reach fewer sports. The head of BT suggested last week that users shouldn't bother changing packages as they already have too many choices anyway. David Whittingdale, Britain's culture secretary, this week said he was \"seriously concerned\" because there were still 22 UK subscription TV providers – 16 of whom carry Sky channels, including Virgin Media, EE and TalkTalk. And Sky's joint venture with Deutsche Telekom and US media conglomerate Comcast in the US has allowed customers to add three major local channels through cable – Fox, ESPN and CNN/Udacity – which means some customers already have 12 terrestrial broadcasters' channels. Both Telia and Vodafone remain committed to selling broadband access across Europe when asked about concerns raised by Sky's merger plans.\n\nI have read (and tried my best to understand) every single day whether or not Telekenatordisket can really claim ownership over a key aspect of the European market due to its merger with EKRO; I know what Telefonista has claimed to own regarding a few related issues: that of providing public access to their fiber television networks which should, ideally, exist equally throughout all EU member states while keeping out rivals' services such as Time Warner's; and whether Vodafone owns any significant interest in the German telco O2 in the context of bundling. There are certainly enough elements which may allow me as a consumer in an EU state to make some very reasonable assumptions as to whether or not any one company is likely to ultimately take over control of the market in those cases, but I suppose we'll find that out once an actual takeover decision takes place and not in the wake of mere speculation. At least as far as European citizens go, Telepenator's claims to ownership seem pretty solid given my admittedly limited analysis: as",
    "French president Jacques Chirac was scathing about Britain's rebate on EU income taxes, accusing the British government of using the payments to prop up its fragile economy. Mr Chirac, who came close to sacking Tony Blair when he returned to power 10 years ago, said the rebate, paid by Britain to the EU, amounted to \"unjustified plunder\" of public resources and was an attempt by Britain to get out of its \"painful\" EU commitments. \"What does the UK rebate mean? You have to pay up, you have to pay something because that is the sum you have accepted and you have got to pay up in order to stay in the EU. And now for three years Britain has had to pay that by itself. Nobody else has said what our rebate is. That amounts to looting. We won't take it because it's unjustified. In any case, all that could have been recovered by other means,\" Mr Chirac said in an interview. Mr Chirac's comments come after the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) lent the UK an aid payment worth £70bn at a rate of 0.08 per cent (£1.2bn) - a small but significant sum for a country the size of Scotland.\n\nThe story notes that the European aid aid is \"a small but significant sum\" for a country the size of Scotland. However, that is a mischaracterization: the British aid was not small – it was about 0.5% of the UK GDP or approximately $30 billion, which translates out to about $80 billion in 2010 British pounds (UK).\n\nThat's about $15 billion less than Australia (also about 0.5% of their GDP). As far as I can tell, Australia didn't request a rebate either. It's possible that Britain's aid was much bigger than Australia's and perhaps Australia requested relief from Britain for its own welfare budget. (Australia's welfare budget is approximately 0.5% of its GDP [or roughly $3 billion, $5 billion, or $6 billion in GDP]), but I haven't been able to determine the exact number.",
    "Britain's economy will be in recession by the end of this year if it does not take urgent action to boost growth and cut its budget deficit, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF said that Britain was on course for a 0.5 per cent contraction in GDP next year as the country struggles with high unemployment and weak productivity. It warned that the UK would need to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio to below 90 per cent by 2015 to avoid a double dip recession. The IMF also said that the government needed to do more to stimulate demand and create jobs.\n\nThis is an interesting statement because it seems to indicate that the IMF believes that the UK has already entered into a recession. However, I have been unable to find any evidence that the IMF actually believes that the UK has entered into a recession. In fact, the IMF has stated repeatedly that they believe that the UK is still growing at a healthy rate.\n\nIn their latest World Economic Outlook report, the IMF states:\n\nWe expect the UK economy to grow by 1.7% in 2012, which is slightly above our forecast of 1.6%. We expect growth to slow further to 1.4% in 2013 before returning to 2.0% in 2014.\n\nSo, while the IMF does not think that the UK has officially entered into a recession, they are confident that the UK is still growing at a healthy pace. This is consistent with what we see in other countries around the world. For example, the US economy grew by 3.1% last quarter, while Japan's economy shrank by 5.2%, Germany's economy contracted by 4.9%, France's economy shrunk by 6.3%, Italy's economy shrank by 7.8%, Spain's economy shrank by 8.1%, and Greece's economy shrank by 9.5%.\n\nHowever, there is one important caveat here. While the IMF does not think that the UK has officially entered into a recession, they do believe that the UK is currently experiencing a mild recession. They state:\n\nThe UK economy is expected to contract by 0.5 percentage points in 2012, compared with a previous estimate of 0.4 percentage point. Growth is projected to return to 1.4% in 2013 before slowing again to 1.3% in 2014.\n\nIf you look at the chart below",

It is followed by Nokia, which clocked up 1.3pc, Apple with 0.1pc, Audi at 0.2pc and Honda on 0.4pc. Blackberry did get 11.5% market share - roughly half that of the 3,600 or so total in production and those sold today.

But one thing is clear; if you want premium phones these days, they need more people playing around for them.\" The fact is, most consumers appear to be content with using their current phones (some would argue, too happy). According to statistics supplied by Gartner, 92% of consumers globally still use personal cellphones as their primary device while only 8 pc prefer other form factors and 4pc use tablets.

    "A prominent Irish journalist has hailed Italy's decision to allow free movement across its porous border with France as a signal that all EU countries are struggling for influence, adding that most people in the Western world will not believe it until it happens – and then they must start taking action immediately.\n\nSean O'Sullivan was speaking at what he described as an \"unwieldy gathering\" in Rome on Thursday. During his hour-long presentation, the former Sunday Business Post editor also criticised the Irish government for cutting public spending after three years in charge in 2014, saying it had failed to show a willingness to tackle tax evasion and increase wages. Speaking to the attendees, including top Italian journalists, Mr O'Sullivan added that his own country's approach had been too timid.\n\nOne young European told the meeting it would be very difficult in their part of Europe, which borders both northern Europe and African migrants in particular, to have a prosperous future if nationalities were unwilling to work together effectively on challenges they share – ranging from reducing the effects of climate change to sharing common borders or even immigration issues such as refugees and terrorism.\n\nMr O'Sullivan said people inside Ireland – particularly among business bosses, civil servants and politicians - had been disappointed with the way they appeared not to hear this warning when it first came from Italy during World War I and it may need to rekindle that faith by letting migrants into the country now to challenge what their governments think should happen next.",
    "A multi-sport event that promised to fill a hole in Liverpool's public calendar has failed to attract any large crowds despite making its initial public offering last weekend. T in the Park attracted two people to watch it play during its first day on sale, according to police, but organisers hoped for 30,000 or more per hour – the figure typically spent by fans at football matches in major towns and cities worldwide. Some tickets were sold online before they became available for general release, meaning none could be guaranteed when they went on sale for anyone else to purchase on Friday 5 January. A spokesman with Liverpool FC said sales had been slow but the overall response had been positive, pointing to a 60% interest among potential purchasers. For the new event which started on 23 November as part of the city's official rebranding process, it makes the announcement more frustrating because events organised via the Reds' Facebook page made far better use of their allotted time (nearly twice the amount of time allocated for an event on the council's website). But for all those who didn't make T in the Park's initial attempts to sell off tickets, the future remains unclear. While the venue had booked the land for a range of events since it opened last June, it will remain vacant until the developer delivers on building two luxury flats. The final bill from that sale isn't known. If no one comes forward to buy the site then it may fall into a redevelopment scheme, which could delay another stage in plans and also means that local communities don't get complete control over what happens there. Despite the event attracting far fewer than expected visitors though, it appears that the government did not put too much stock in this single bid. Just nine months ago, the government was giving strong encouragement to developers eager to build thousands of homes around Anfield due to promises that they would help pay for it and other housing stock. A few hours after selling all five million tickets, chief executive Ian Ayre confirmed he needed another £250m extra funding for big housing projects ahead of next May's general election. This would include the new housing development for Liverpool City Council currently in construction and other large houses built in the past seven years, a decision some called on Liverpool's councillors to reverse. However, Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said during his speech at the unveiling of the ticket scheme in October's City Hall reception suite that more should have been done given all he",
    "Howard will use stem cell donation to fight Ebola in Africa and donate the tissue to research firms in the US. His decision comes as a new scare is spreading over the Ebola virus at London's Heathrow Airport. The airport declared a 'level 1' incident in the terminal, the highest level, after some passengers in protective suits complained of \"swelling, tingling and severe aches\".\n\nAs reported by the Telegraph, the health authorities have been working on a project to grow Ebola organs as a possible 'cure' for the deadly virus.

    "Britain's economy has been boosted by an improving global outlook and a strong pound, according to official figures today. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that gross domestic product (GDP) grew at its fastest pace since early 2009 last month as exports rose and consumer spending picked up. GDP growth was 0.7 per cent in the three months to September, compared with 0.4 per cent in August. It was also the strongest performance since the first quarter of 2010. Economists had expected GDP growth of 0.5 per cent. The ONS said that while the UK economy was still struggling to recover from the financial crisis, it was now on track to grow by 2.1 per cent this year. That would be faster than any other major advanced economy except Germany. The recovery will be helped by a stronger currency which makes British goods more competitive abroad. Inflation remains low but economists expect prices to rise next year as the weak pound pushes up import costs.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, if you look at the chart below, you can see that the UK economy has grown by 3% over the past 12 months. This means that the UK economy has grown by about 1.6 times the size of the US economy during the same period. So, the UK economy is growing much faster than the US economy.\n\nThis is not surprising given that the UK economy is smaller than the US economy. However, the fact that the UK economy is growing so fast is very encouraging. If we compare the UK economy to the rest of Europe, we find that the UK economy is growing at a rate of just under 4%. This compares to a European average of around 5%, meaning that the UK economy is growing at a rate similar to that of the US economy.\n\nIn addition, the UK economy is growing at a rate comparable to that of Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia, Malta, Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates",
    "In the wake of revelations about US surveillance, some people are asking whether it's possible to be completely secure in today's world.\n\nBut what if you could have complete confidence that your communications were safe? What if you could rely on the security of your mobile phone or computer without having to worry about hackers stealing them?\n\nThat's exactly what a new project called Signal aims to do. It uses end-to-end encryption - meaning no one but the sender and receiver can read the messages - to let users communicate securely with each other.\n\nIt was developed by Open Whisper Systems (OWS), an encrypted messaging app which has been downloaded more than 100 million times since its launch last year.\n\nNow OWS wants to make Signal available for everyone, so anyone can use it to send and receive private messages.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The NSA scandal has led many to ask how they can remain secure online\n\n\"We're trying to build something that will work for everybody,\" says OWS co-founder Moxie Marlinspike.\n\n\"There's a lot of interest in this because there's a real need for this.\"\n\nEncryption is used to protect all kinds of data, including financial transactions, medical records and even internet traffic. But it also protects our personal information when we talk to friends and family over the telephone.\n\nFor example, if I want to tell my mother I'm OK, I don't want her to hear me crying on the phone. If she hears me crying, she might think I've broken up with her.\n\nSo why would someone want to encrypt their conversations?\n\nOne reason is that it makes it harder for governments to spy on us.\n\nIf the government wanted to listen in on my conversation, it would have to break into my house and get hold of my laptop. That's not going to happen.\n\nAnother reason is that it allows us to share information privately with those who may not necessarily agree with our political views.\n\nWhen I write a blog post, I don't want to give away any sensitive details. So I encrypt it using strong cryptography.\n\nAnd if I want to send a message to my friend, I don't want him to see my email address. So I encrypt it too.\n\n'No backdoors'\n\nHowever, there",

    "Parmalat, Belgium's largest savings bank, has been banned from suing over the financial collapse that plunged Belgium into crisis in 2007, a Belgian court has ruled.\n\nThe court said the banks' lawyers had failed to prove that a Belgian law for insolvency made it impossible for the banks to sue each other.\n\nAn earlier ruling in Brussels had blocked the banks from suing each other, in part because some firms' debts had reached the European Central Bank's bail-in limits, which would have required them to pay in cash and not on their assets.\n\nAn earlier ruling had also delayed the banks' filing for claims for compensation until next year, which is when their legal claims against the government should have started.\n\nThe court in the capital Brussels has been asked to overturn the decision of a lower court.\n\nParmalat, the country's third largest lender by customers, has been battling a wave of bank closures and a prolonged slump in consumer confidence.\n\nThe total loss at Belgian banks from the crisis will now not exceed an estimated €1bn, which does not include claims from other banks.\n\nThe Belgian law for insolvency says that if a creditor has €1bn (one billion pounds; $1.03bn) in a bank, then it must be allowed to pursue a claim against the bank for the difference between its liabilities and the value of its assets.\n\nParmalat, whose name means \"little bank\", was given an ultimatum in 2007 to either boost capital by €750m or close and merge with fellow Belgian lender Laval.\n\nLaval has since been merged with Belgian bank ABN Amro to create ABN Amro Group, the world's largest bank, which has a market capitalisation of €6.57bn.\n\nThe bank has struggled in recent months to shed its international reputation, which suffered in part from concerns over the role that it played in the collapse of the U.S. housing market in 2006, which led to a global recession and a global banking crisis.",

    "A court has ruled that an American company accused of copying patents for making home furniture designs won't have to pay compensation in a lawsuit by people it claims are their wives or girlfriends. The U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month rejected a motion made by Mark Kowalski, who runs Reverb Publishing, against Paul Pfeiffer of the California-based maker of similar line-up of items. (This is not the first time he's tried to assert ownership over those designs.) In ruling otherwise though, Judge Susan Illston wrote on Dec. 11 that Kowalski failed to show sufficient facts establishing legal personality through which the patents could be asserted.\n\n\n\"No one ever said to someone at a parties when these designs were patented — do you know me?!\"\n\n…and how did a married couple have any connection with what has now become known as the Reverb design \"stamp?\" It was Kowalski himself who initially started inventing them by his own hand (i.e., starting something new). A New York Times story about one of them describes the process in detail:\n\nKowsky had been selling novelty items online before the site went global. After meeting someone there who needed some work done and found him in California, he offered to help him out while he found an appropriate material. Eventually, the man decided to use wood rather than metal—to get rid of the carbon footprint. He selected oak because that was popular among carpenters, yet flexible enough so that he could shape it around objects he wanted to attach to it. … When the guy saw the finished product, Kowalski soon had one dozen or 20 versions of the design being handed out.

Within two years — and with no marketing at all — Kowalski received the U.S. Patent Office registration for the stamp and became involved in lawsuits over its patent rights several other countries.

    "Technology gets the creative bug\n\nTechnology gets the creative bug The world has given people access to countless gadgets that have made us all more productive – from the calculator to the smart phone. Now there are even a few that can actually make us more creative. As it happens in every modern economy, the more of a person's time, attention and skills are devoted to an activity or product, the greater the likelihood is there are products or services at the \"producer\" end that can help or be of service to the person. As a result, people have created a thriving sub-culture of designers, programmers, product managers and many others who are trying to out-do our more \"mundane\" counterparts, many of whom are at a professional disadvantage as a result. One example of that is an app that has had the creative bug. If you've used Pinterest, you'll have seen the website's collection of inspirational images that are being repurposed by people across the globe. A version of the app called The Pixel Fits was created to allow people with visual-arts and animation skills use these images in apps, websites and films. It also offers a service to people willing to give up their normal workflow to create graphics for their creations. The app's creator, Matt Gebbie, says the app has already helped hundreds of artists and engineers out of boredom. Matt Gebbie, creative director, Pixel Fits: \"We started this to find people who are out of work in graphic design or computer software and that is what we've found — quite often people just don't know what else to do in a creative way so they want to go out and work on something they like, they don't realise there are other ways of getting involved and being creative.\" This was the idea behind Pixel Fits.\n\nAs well as inspiring thousands of users worldwide, it's also opened up the possibility of people making a tidy profit (although it appears many of them are more interested in their privacy than making a mint).\n\nIf you are currently the owner of a Pixel Fits-branded product, you may not have realised the opportunity is yours. Although there is a fee to download the app for free, the app has been in demand due to a large number of people wanting to turn their idle hands into something productive.

    "A new study has found that more than half of all letters sent to UK households are junk mail, with one in five containing no information at all. The research by the Royal Mail and the University of Surrey also revealed that nearly two thirds of people receive at least one piece of junk mail every month. The findings come as the Government prepares to introduce tougher rules on junk mail after it was revealed last week that some firms were sending out millions of pieces of junk mail without authorisation. The survey of 2,000 adults found that almost three quarters (72%) received at least one piece of junk mail each month. More than half (56%) said they had received at least one letter which contained no information whatsoever. One in five (21%) received at least one letter which contained no information at all. A further 14% received at least one letter which contained only a picture or logo. The researchers say that this suggests that many people may be receiving junk mail without realising it. They warn that the results could have serious implications for society if people do not take action to stop being targeted. Professor David Stuckler, Director of the Centre for Consumer Research at the University of Surrey, who led the research, says: \"We know that junk mail can cause problems for consumers, but we didn't realise just how much. This research shows that there is a huge amount of junk mail circulating in our country.\" He added: \"It's important that people understand what junk mail is and what it isn't. Junk mail should never contain any personal details such as names, addresses or phone numbers. It should always include an unsubscribe link so you can opt-out of future correspondence.\" The Royal Mail has already announced plans to crack down on junk mail after it emerged that some companies were sending out millions of unwanted letters without authorisation. In March, the company launched a campaign called 'Stop Sending Us Your Junk'. The campaign will see the firm send out a million letters to customers warning them that their mail is being used illegally. The company claims that it has been forced to act because of growing concerns over the number of illegal junk mail scams. The Royal Mail has previously warned that it would launch a crackdown on illegal junk mail after it was discovered that some firms were sending out millions of unwanted letters without authorisation.

    "Stephen Crabb (Liberal Democrats) has quit his post as Chief Executive just 26 days after taking up the role. The ex-Chancellor, who will be replaced later this month by Robert Halfon, is believed to have decided not to stand for re-election at the next election. Conservative insiders are reported to have been shocked when Mr Crabb told colleagues he was leaving immediately in a meeting on Tuesday afternoon. He would normally have only been replaced a few weeks into a four year term but after an initial leadership contest and a subsequent reshuffle, there were fears that they could now fight to hold onto him instead of a local MP. The departure comes exactly three years after Stephen Gilbert officially took up a career position with McKinsey. Last week it emerged that Mr Crabb's father Ralph was working for Goldman Sachs while holding dual roles there. That followed reports last summer which claimed he had been paid millions of pounds by one of the most influential financial firms during a time when many of Britain's major firms faced questions about their exposure to Europe's debt crisis. One Tory said: \"I don't think there was any doubt in anybody's mind before Mr Crabb got the job that David Cameron was going to be prime minister.\n\nIt seems strange that the \"Conservative insider' says, after one day on the job, that the \"expectations were so low, but they're obviously disappointed.\" In any event, Crabb served a fairly short two year term prior to this resignation, meaning he will leave the party within a couple of months. But the real question now is what replaces Stephen?",
    "The story first appeared in the December 2013 issue of \"Butler,\" \"Butler's Guide to Spain,\" a quarterly magazine for chefs and food-lovers.\n\nButler hit the bull's-eye this week as the European country awarded the acclaimed restaurant a three-year, 20-million-euro grant to help with the renovations to one of its favorite watering holes – the Plaza Picasso.\n\nThe money, the country's first-ever grant for such a project, is one of the first steps in a strategy that, for the next 12 months, will provide the Spanish with a monthly contribution from the world-famous restaurant.\n\nThe grant—which will benefit the Plaza Picasso from next March through early February 2016—represents a victory for the ambitious New York restaurant.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to see us get to the point that we can start to use that money to continue adding to something that we love,\" says co-owner of butler, Simon Cowell.\n\nNoting that the last year has been a busy one for the restaurant, Cowell says it has been \"an incredibly exciting year for Butler: the first time in our history we've opened five restaurants in one year and we've opened a restaurant every day for the past two months.\"\n\nIn addition to opening the Plaza Picasso, that year was notable for being Butler's busiest ever. This is due, in large part, to the opening of the butler's new restaurant on the roof of the restaurant in Pizzella in Madrid, which Cowell explains, \"in some respects is a second home to the restaurants here in Madrid.\"\n\nHe adds that \"one of the big differences between Madrid and NYC is that we have an open plan, not much of any walls around here and that's something we have to accommodate.\" Cowell and his father, Tony Cowell, a French-born pastry chef and chef-owner of three Paris restaurant brands, have opened nearly 500 restaurants in 39 countries around the world, so it comes as no surprise that the Spanish capital proved irresistible.\n\nCowell says his most favorite feature of Madrid is its diversity.\n\n\"There's a lot of different food traditions in Madrid in the Spanish-speaking part of the city, and then there's a very cosmopolitan and global feel to the rest of the city.

    "A former Conservative Party councillor who described her party as \"disgusting\" and claimed that immigrants are less likely to work hard has quit UKIP. Mary Kilroy left the Conservatives just weeks ahead of national vote counting, accusing Nigel Farage's campaign of being sexist and racist. In interviews with various newspapers before and since she took her decision Mary accused those on board \"of playing the race card\". Kilroy – the leader of the Green group in Brighton's Westminster constituency – stood down after four years in UKIP. She said that while others may like UKIP but they were not welcome: \"I think people have got to realise when you vote for something like this it doesn't necessarily reflect their character personally or politically.\" It was a shock move, given that Kilroy had taken up the role of deputy chairwoman and would normally be seen at Tory conference. But in response Ukip said: \"Mary has been an active member on many occasions including meetings and events hosted by the party during the leadership election. We wish her well in future.\" As recently as November, Mary publicly defended Nigel Farage about his anti-Muslim rhetoric in interviews with local media in Brighton and Hove after criticism began mounting from around Europe over comments made by the UKIP leader. During a debate on Europe hosted by the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Farage warned that \"there is going to come a time soon in Europe where we've got to manage our borders\". And earlier today he told the Radio 4 Today Programme in London that UKIP voters will also vote for candidates \"who disagree with them on immigration because if your family doesn't fit into the Muslim community then there are no migrants worth taking in\", while arguing that the party will never support open door migration policies such as free movement of labour which has seen huge numbers of eastern Europeans claim jobs from British workers.\n\n\nYou may wonder why the Daily Mail chose the date of UKIP membership application (in 2001) to publish stories on Kilroy's departure from the party. Perhaps due to embarrassment over her accusations against members of the Conservative and Labour parties, Kilroy felt too much like a victim. Or perhaps she believed things would change once Farage did become the next prime minister and won an election rather than remain on the sidelines, as previously anticipated. The former Conservative was even willing to admit she would have preferred Ed Miliband over David Cameron, but then again what choice does anyone really have",
    "Robinson, who has been in charge since 2010, was furious after being told by his bosses that he would not be allowed to play for England at next year's World Cup finals in Brazil. He said: 'I'm very disappointed with the way it all went down. I've got no problem playing for my country but I don't think they should have done this.' The FA had initially offered him an alternative role as head coach of their Under-21s team, which will take on Germany and Portugal in the European Championships in Poland and Ukraine later this summer. But Robinson refused to accept the offer because he felt he could do more good coaching the senior side. He added: 'It's disappointing because I feel like I can still help them out. It's just one of those things where you're left feeling frustrated.'\n\nThis is what happened when the FA tried to get rid of him:\n\nIn January 2011, the FA announced that Robinson would become the new manager of the under-21s. However, he was sacked two months later after failing to win any games in the Premier League or Championship. In March 2012, he was appointed as assistant manager to Roy Hodgson, who took over as England boss in June 2013.\n\nSo why did the FA want to sack him? Well, according to the BBC, it was because he didn't believe in the system:\n\nHe believes the FA's structure is flawed and says he wants to change it. He also feels the FA are too focused on winning trophies rather than developing young players.\n\nAnd here's another quote from the same article:\n\n'I'd love to see the FA go back to its roots,' he said. 'We need to look at how we develop players and give them opportunities to succeed. We need to stop looking at the short term and start thinking about the long term.'\n\nThat sounds pretty much exactly like what the FA were saying when they fired Glenn Hoddle. And if you read between the lines, it seems like the FA wanted to fire Robinson because he wasn't going to follow the rules.\n\nBut then again, maybe they weren't trying to fire him because he was right. Maybe they were trying to fire him because he was wrong.",

    "BUSTED singer Mark Lanegan has taken time out for \"a little bit of family life and rest\", with girlfriend Danielle Houghton in Los Angeles, before flying back tomorrow (Saturday) ahead of their UK tour on Sunday night… The pair have been dating since last October but had planned it as just an exciting summer romance. But they soon fell head over heels after they went public about his divorce. Then came an offer of a job offer to be at their home when they saw each other off to LA so they could finally go public by telling all their fans what was going on. Well now the plan has turned into one big thing which is bound be a source of envy among many of them. \"It's my first real chance to do anything new,\" says Lanegan, who admits he feels like he mustn't disappoint his fans yet. \"We've done four songs together already – I mean four.\" He laughs while telling me everything will sound different if he's not writing anymore, adding that she hasn't told him she will also start her own musical career… In typical pop band fashion, Busted recently released albums on both Tresor and Virgin Records. They are set for an American tour this spring through May before performing in Europe beginning in January.\"\n\nThere weren't any stories about how he had to take some time away from getting ready or making music to support their careers that we are aware of, nor were there reports that an announcement regarding his future plans would happen anytime soon.

That said, that didn't stop several people from expressing concern over his choice to publicly release something that he knows to be untrue before saying much further.

But Christmas shoppers remain very happy with how things turn out. Sales, which rose 5% during November, may well reach 1 million units this year, according to some experts. In all years through 2007, holiday spending averaged 954.4 billion euros while this year's forecast shows an increase of about 10%. The number-one reason given by consumers who cited increased spending is better weather than they expected. On average across Europe – including Britain – the best months were June to September and those least favoured were December, January or February. It means retailers can sell off old stock before Christmas when stocks of certain items run low. Overall, according to the European Commission, euro area goods exports have fallen for five straight quarters while imports of these goods only slightly rose as China continued a slump and Germany rebounded from last year's eurozone crisis. Euro-area consumers spend roughly twice as much as Americans on household products such as shampoo and deodorant so rising demand could help boost the European economy ahead of the key US presidential elections in November. Consumers here also took advantage of lower prices between early 2011 and 2012 and have since spent nearly 50% more this year, compared with a year ago. As the first cold snap hits today (Tuesday 2 December), many experts forecast that shoppers should continue spending heavily for the remainder of the month. However, holiday traffic was likely to pick up in the next few days.\n\nAs per data gathered by Bloomberg, UK retail sales were reportedly at their highest ever in November, beating any previous record set during last year's record-breaking Black Friday weekend which attracted billions of pounds worth of overseas purchases including clothes, toys and furniture.",

    "In just two years, Apple has transformed itself from a quirky startup specialising in high-end electronic items into one of the most powerful companies on Earth... The transformation started with the launch of the iMac computer and tablet computers which became instant hits. It was only the beginning for the company who had until then been focused entirely on selling hi-tech products. But within 18 months it transformed itself to become one of America's most important technologies giants as its mobile devices such as iPads, iPhones, iPod Touch and iTunes Store all went global. Apple now sells more than 10m units a quarter and accounts for five per cent of the entire world market of electronic goods.... But it wasn't long before these successes brought further excitement - particularly after the iPhone launched last year. Despite initial scepticism that this would succeed, consumers quickly warmed up to the idea of having their own device. Within ten days of its release Apple sold nearly a million phones a day. That figure rose steadily as demand continued throughout the holidays when few new smartphones were being released. By January, three million Apple customers had made sure that the first generation iPhone was not just a hit but arguably the biggest success since the Macintosh computer debuted in 1984. Now with sales of more than 7 million phones so far this has helped the company regain lost confidence in the PC industry despite a strong recovery in prices on older models. And by March this year Apple was already predicting even greater gains in both revenue and unit sales next year as more shoppers were willing to make the switch to the'mini' version of its latest phone and iPad.

    "David Cameron will say today that it's time for an energy policy to take Britain forward, and he will deliver it with a fresh set of proposals in the Queen's Speech next week – but without committing himself completely to any particular way of delivering the changes his party has long called for.... At a gathering of Tory Party members at The Grove pub last night Mr Cameron's campaign chair David Davis had already ruled out including a new tax on fracking, which was once supported by Energy Secretary Amber Rudd as part of her vision for lower costs and more security.... Instead he would announce plans to create hundreds of thousands of new manufacturing jobs through a programme of infrastructure projects... There could also be a rise of 0.5p per litre fuel duty imposed when refilling diesel cars that run on gasoline at higher prices. This is not what they really want.\" [BBC, 29th May 2015]\n\nAccordingly British Gas has joined the ranks of shale gas companies which have warned of a price rise if the increase is implemented despite their claim of being competitive against domestic production. \"The oil prices of the summer are going up,\" said a source: \"'They will go back down again.' They're making sure people know exactly what's coming.\" And British Energy too, after announcing that it may end customer discounts in 2016, has asked customers to accept much tougher terms if it cannot win a large share market share elsewhere - a move which would likely result in prices rising sharply since much of the existing stock is now beyond its sell-by date of 2026. But what of renewable sources? It seems that many would welcome such options but others argue that no politician who wants to retain electoral support should seek to make climate change a cause célèbre for political advantage (the same accusation could perhaps be levelled against those arguing against carbon trading). Even so, some environmentalists remain concerned about the impact of such measures given the current UK climate legislation means we're unlikely to achieve world emissions reductions within two decades - we've been told repeatedly that this target isn't achievable within a reasonable timeframe anyway - and that's assuming renewables can continue to grow exponentially whilst maintaining technological innovation. Yet most experts view solar PV panels and pumped hydro power stations as the future based on proven technology; and while there remains a lack of commercial deployment models which allow us to produce cheap, reliable clean electricity then these technologies will doubtless play a big role on a",
    "A Bank of England committee has voted to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% - but only if inflation stays below its 2% target. The decision means that the Bank will not raise rates until next year, and could be forced to do so again in 2017. It comes after the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted unanimously last week to leave interest rates unchanged. But it also follows warnings by the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, that the economy was growing too slowly to meet the Bank's 2% inflation target. Mr Haldane said there were signs that inflation was rising faster than expected, which would make it harder for the Bank to hit its target. He warned that the Bank needed to act quickly to avoid higher prices and wage rises.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, firstly, we have seen the MPC vote unanimously to keep rates where they are. This means that the majority of members believe that the current low level of inflation is sustainable. Secondly, the MPC has decided to wait until next year before raising rates. In other words, the MPC believes that the economic recovery is still weak enough to allow them to delay any further increases until 2016.\n\nThirdly, the MPC has decided to wait until next year before increasing rates.

    "LONDON (BBC) UK users were warned on Thursday to beware computer screen savers after being plagued by unsolicited e-mails and online advertising. The Royal Mail has warned that fake offers are being displayed instead of legitimate ones due to the'spam-blocking' service Screensaver running on user computers in its customer support centres throughout the country. In addition, it has advised customers that as some of the screensavers don't follow any of its guidelines or industry standards for image quality, they risk damaging their computer systems. It suggests that if necessary they should turn off the feature so as not to damage them further. A spokesman said that the feature had been installed by operators \"to help people block unwanted emails\", which have been popping up at a rate of more than one per minute. However he acknowledged that the company would always recommend against installing it unless absolutely needed on certain machines with high usage. \"We would never install a screensaver unless we really felt we should,\" the newspaper quoted a Royal Mail spokesman saying. \"But we do need to be able to check what's being used.\" The spokesperson also confirmed that Screensaver was only an option for users concerned about unwanted messages, but insisted: \"This is very widely known now - the vast majority of this behaviour happens through phishing attacks, where criminals email people using links to malicious Web sites. We've noticed that many scammers will send out large numbers of these links over a short period before contacting individual users individually via a scam.\" But some computer professionals say Screeners create problems for users who run operating systems other than Microsoft Windows, including Macs. They say that although hackers must often circumvent existing security measures such as anti-virus software, the software does not necessarily protect against all threats and adds additional clutter that is confusing to system administrators. As well as scanning computer connections, Screensaver scans Web pages, too at the users' request and can force them close. Users complain that these actions reduce desktop file sharing opportunities and could even prevent them from visiting their bank or post office for example, since their accounts frequently open in separate desktops. Asking a potential victim for personal details (including names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses), or attempting to use them to initiate contact can also prompt warnings from Screensaver when it encounters them that they have contacted someone who might try and buy drugs or pose as a telemarketer.

It is helping to achieve the Conservative commitment to increase National Insurance by just 3.5 per cent in real terms for those in the lowest tax brackets.\n\n\"We are making a new investment of over £17 billion over the next five years as a result of the new funding mechanism for National Insurance and the Government will also create over 100,000 jobs as a result of the policy.\n\n\"People working in employment have their premiums frozen from April 2016.\n\n\"The health of the NHS is the responsibility of all parties in power and we will listen and learn from their proposals to build on these sensible and practical measures.\"\n\nMr Cameron has said the government will deliver the greatest transformation of the NHS in its history but has been questioned about any further cost and the possibility the policy would not save the NHS from the financial crisis.\n\nHe was forced to clarify the policy this morning after Conservative MP and chair of",

    "A new poster campaign has been launched to help Londoners get around their city more easily, with the aim of making it easier for people to find out where they are going and what time they need to be there. The posters feature a map showing the location of all tube stations in the capital, along with information on how long each one will take to reach by public transport. They also include a list of the most popular routes into central London, as well as the best times to catch the Tube at peak times. The posters have been produced by advertising agency JCDecaux, which says that they were designed to make it easier for people to plan their journeys. It said: 'We wanted to create something that would encourage people to use public transport more often.' The posters are being rolled out across London over the next few weeks, but the company says that they can be found in many other cities including New York, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo and Hong Kong.\n\nI'm not sure if this is an example of \"the government's war on the poor\", or just a case of bad design.

    "Activists believe the challenge is part of a larger trend of people reclaiming the street – whether it's taking over the National Mall in Washington and replacing the national flag with a giant green one, or setting up encampments at airports where they refuse to fly. Protesters are calling it the \"Global Day of Action\". It can be seen as a response to the growing influence of corporations in politics via SuperPACs and lobbying, as well as to climate change activists fighting to protect the Arctic. Some say the challenge is an act of civil disobedience designed to make a statement, especially as President Obama prepares to deliver his speech on climate change from the White House on Monday… Activists said the Global Day of Action should be seen as something other than an act of civil disobedience. \"The goal is not to shut down the airport or the flights,\" said Scott Crowder, an activist in the movement. \"It's a response to a larger system that's broken.\"\n\nNow that's interesting. Not only is this action against a company whose CEO is a billionaire, the protestors are also calling what they're doing an act of civil disobedience while using a hashtag that's been used at multiple mass actions that have involved taking to the street of people's homes and businesses on behalf of specific causes and political aims – i.e. #blacklivesmatter.\n\nThe same is going to happen at airports and on other public streets during the President's speech tonight.\n\nThis is what being \"civil\" looks like?\n\nAs I predicted back shortly after Barack Obama was elected to office, the same thing that once had the public in a frenzy over the threat posed by an \"elite\" who would \"make war on the American people\" is becoming the new mantra that's promoted by those who are now being depicted as \"out of control\" and who are going too far in their \"disruption tactics.\"\n\n\"Civil Disobedience\" has become the brand of those who have the power and control – which is exactly what those who are pushing the \"truce with terrorists\" narrative were able to achieve through their military actions and the use of massive military intervention with no regard for the consequences.\n\nAnd that's why now is where the country is having the hardest time separating fact and fiction when it comes to these events – because people are being bombarded with news reports, television reports and videos that",
    "The Chancellor had already signalled his intention the day before, by setting out a five-year timetable for reform and promising to use his new influence on the chamber to encourage peers to adopt more moderate opinions. But Mr Osborne's comments yesterday highlighted that more drastic changes are planned - which he suggested were needed because Labour has been in effect \"waging war against people over many years\". He said MPs must change their mindset and do everything possible to convince peers that they need reforms - but hinted they may have some difficulties, describing it as \"a process like any other\". On Tuesday evening, after a breakfast meeting with Lord Ashcroft, who donated £1 million towards David Cameron's election campaign last year, Mr Osborne chaired an audience discussion hosted by the Sunday Express newspaper, drawing an enthusiastic response from the group. Asked repeatedly whether peers should be disbarred altogether or simply forced to resign if voters found them disloyal, Mr Osborne did nothing more than emphasise that \"all powers should belong to Parliament\" and warned they must make sure their views can be taken into account by politicians. Conservative Baroness Warsi, one of those present at the news conference, told BBC News its format allowed her to be much clearer about what needs to happen to get rid of all of its backbenchers : It was a great way of having straight answers from him [Mr Osborne]. You have got two or three journalists here and you want me to just give my opinion? I am not going to give that opinion now!...This process is for everyone within parliament who wants to help remove MPs from Parliament, it is not really aimed at members of parliament themselves.\" While Labour welcomed Mr Osborne's suggestions, sources within the party cautioned against getting ahead of plans being discussed in the Cabinet Office this weekend, saying while Mr Miliband agreed people in high office should expect \"the benefit of the doubt\", some issues would only be addressed once the public trust has been restored. One senior party source said any proposals put forward on Thursday from Ed Miliband, will only involve changing rules around how peers are selected after the next general election while no outright disqualification exists. However Ms Cooper said there won't necessarily be such drastic consequences, with former leader Sir Edward Heath getting immunity during his lifetime. She added it was up to Westminster government to set its own agenda when it comes to reforming Parliament. Meanwhile Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna defended the PM's appointment of",

    "David Cameron and Nick Clegg have agreed that spending restrictions will be eased on welfare payments in an attempt to ease Tory anger about David Miliband's pledge not to raise income tax by more than 10%, an official close to both men said today. The agreement also includes plans to improve business rates – something both leaders agree was crucial if voters were to believe they had heard what Ed Miliband really meant when he promised people would not lose out because of economic change. A source close to Mr Romney told reporters in Boston this morning that they hadn't discussed their differences on taxes at all, which has been one of his main complaints as he fights to reclaim some of the ground lost over the past two weeks since conceding defeat. But sources described Mr Clegg's move as \"good\" for a number of reasons, with a focus on business rates and an easing of capital allowance rules also part of the package. They said it would avoid any perception of a split and Mr Cameron's spokesman added there had recently been a great deal more political activity between the two men than usual, suggesting there could even already be talk within No 10 about forming a new coalition. The official described the talks as serious but also said they were not expected until mid-July – far too late to block Labour's chances of winning – and that neither side wanted such dramatic decisions announced in the run up to parliamentary elections. For now the leaders are committed only to changes worth 3 per cent to national insurance contributions (NICs) and VAT because MPs would vote against any other policy proposed. In return, the Tories will accept Labour calls to allow working families who are on low or medium incomes to claim £5,000 extra from a personal savings account during a financial crisis.\n\nThat sounds reasonable enough. I am skeptical of changing taxation without a specific fiscal response; however, there may well be a significant amount of interest groups pushing for this change. Also, a very important caveat must exist so let me address the most likely objection I see to raising NIC/VAT. As our readers know, I think that if I can choose my own NIS/VAT schedule in real terms instead of making use of projections based upon inflation that then my decision won't make much difference. However, once you start moving it towards a certain amount of money being paid, it isn't clear whether your situation will improve, reduce, or stay basically the same or deterior",

This is America, this is a melting pot. It is very difficult to understand for me that they would be offended because I am an American and I don't understand.\"\n\nIn fact, when the word'miner' is mentioned in the US, it's usually with an associated derogatory term such as 'nigger'. It appears as if Navratilova has mistaken black people for their former colonial overlords.\n\nWhat is really fascinating about this is the fact that in 1999, the US government declared that all the mines in Kosovo were unsafe and that no European mining company would do business there, unless the Yugoslavs took action against the 'threat' of Albanian workers being imported to do the dangerous and dangerous work. That's right, the US government thought that there would be fewer Albanian workers in the mines if they were given a chance to learn the trade rather than being stuck in the mines all their lives.\n\nIt has been proved repeatedly that the mines in Kosovo can only be operated by people with substantial experience in working in mines before. When, and they never do, they come back to work. The best solution would have been to allow people in to work before they took away jobs from people in Kosovo.\n\nThis is what all the people with a degree in economics have been talking about for years: it is not a meritocracy, it comes down to hard work.

    "A new survey has found that house prices in England and Wales have risen by 0.2% over the past year, but are still well below their pre-crisis peak. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the annual rate of growth was 1.1%, down on last year's figure of 1.3%. But it added that the average price of a home had increased to £217,000 - up 2.5% compared with last year. Prices were also higher than they were at the start of 2008, when the economy was hit by the financial crisis. In London, where property values have soared, the ONS said the average price of a home stood at £450,000. However, the figures showed that the number of properties sold fell by 3.4% in the 12 months to March 2015, while the number of people buying homes rose by 4.6%.\n\nThis is not true. The headline statistic is correct, but the rest of the story is misleading.\n\nFirst, the headline statistic is accurate. It shows that the average price of a UK home has increased by 2.5% since the beginning of 2014. This is an improvement on the previous year, which saw the average price rise by just 1.7%.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the average price of a UK home has increased by more than inflation. As we've seen above, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is currently running at around 2.9%.

    "The Guardian's David Leigh and Chris Elliott have made an embarrassing request for the White House to provide complete documents about its emails, as well as some other correspondence involving Trump officials in the past week. The requests reflect that those two conservative journalists – along with a new band of investigative bloggers seeking to publish stories on the most sensitive details – are getting restless amid what they regard as Trump's refusal to stand behind his repeated claims that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama during the campaign. Trump has so far shown little inclination to support the reports of White House spying, after repeatedly denying that such activity took place as recently as Friday morning. Meanwhile top intelligence officials have confirmed that there was no secret order for surveillance activities against the president or any other US citizen; rather, such activity originated from within the NSA itself. Leigh told the Washington Post this month he may be looking into emails because he believes Donald Trump Jr was working with WikiLeaks' Julian Assange when he agreed in July 2016 to meet with a Russian lawyer in hopes of obtaining \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton – though it isn't clear what would be said in such a meeting. That report came just hours after The Wall Street Journal published a story alleging that members of Trump administration had emailed or been in contact with Russian government employees prior to November 8. The new reporting found at least five White House aides – including national security adviser Michael Flynn, White House counsel Don McGahn, former assistant attorney general Sean Spicer, communications director Hope Hicks and spokesman Alan Cobb. It also identified Jeff Sessions as one who didn't communicate with Russians, raising questions about whether his meetings last year while serving as President-elect were properly disclosed. In all the meetings listed by the Journal, none involved Russia, although Trump reportedly hoped for better relations should he become president.\n\n\nWhy won't President Trump release ALL his tax returns?

    "A new study suggests that gamers are more likely to be obese than non-gamers, and that they're also less likely to exercise regularly. The research was carried out by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), who found that men who play video games for an average of three hours per day were twice as likely to be overweight or obese compared with those who played for two hours or less. Women who play video games for an average of four hours per week were also twice as likely to be overweight or obese. The study's lead author, Dr Michael Mrazek, said: \"We know that people who spend time playing video games tend to have higher levels of physical activity. But we didn't expect to see this association between gaming and obesity.\" He added: \"It's not clear why some people become obese while others don't. It may be because some people are simply more physically active than others.\" The study involved 1,000 adults in the US aged 18 to 65. They were asked about their level of physical activity and whether they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease or cancer. Those who reported spending more than three hours a day on computer games were almost twice as likely to be overweight or obese compared with those who spent less than two hours a day. The study was published online today in the journal Obesity.\n\nThis is a very interesting study. I'm sure it will get lots of attention. However, there are several problems with it. First, it doesn't take into account how much time people actually spend playing video games. If you only play video games for 2 hours a day, then your chances of being overweight or obese go up by 50%. Second, it doesn't consider what kind of game players these are. Are they hardcore gamers? Casual gamers? Or do they just like to sit around all day and watch TV? Third, it doesn't look at the amount of time people spend watching television. If you only watch TV for 3 hours a day, then your chances of becoming overweight or obese goes down by 40%! Fourth, it doesn't take into account other factors such as age, gender, race, income, education, etc. That means that if you're a woman who plays video games for 4 hours a day, but you're also a college student, you'll still be twice as likely to be overweight or obese as",
    "A man from Leicester has been crowned a Video Games Champion in Las Vegas after he beat hundreds of others at an elite tournament to secure £9,500. The event saw gamers compete and play games such as Call Of Duty Black Ops 2, FIFA 14, Battlefield 4, Assassin's Creed 3 &4, The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct, Madden NFL 25 &26, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and more at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino on August 15th 2014.

Watch the video below which outlines Dave Crampton's amazing accomplishment, or simply read on for details from the official World Champion website: How did it feel winning your first ever World Championships? It feels like I'm in first place. That's where it all started back in 2011 when I'd met Rob Hodson via email (yes, that Rob). As usual whenever we get together people tend to say some rather crazy things so I thought \"what are you thinking!\" It sounded good in my head; I would be playing top tier EA titles and Rob would have his PS3 hooked up to what appears to be a giant TV screen right next to us, a pair of consoles were in the middle while the tables behind him showed actual action (forgive me if I'm wrong because no words can really convey how awesome this was). What followed next was several late nights before arriving but once we arrived things settled down quickly. When Rob and I got seated there were around 20 tables sitting out and each table had 12 players. Naturally everyone wanted their shot with the golden goblet but this isn't necessarily the case in most tournaments although Rob and I didn't know these guys so our strategy was just make sure there weren't any surprises! In order for any sort of analysis of players ability we've actually used a method a couple of years ago by taking two pictures with both camera (a regular GoPro for reference) pointing at different positions within the scene and using software to do motion interpolation to remove camera shake. We took that and applied it (to a lesser extent still) to each player in relation to each other. By doing this we're able to build a relative \"score map\" of who had made better moves or who seemed to move more consistently. This allowed the computer AI teams to determine who was the best of roughly half of",

    "Rome, 23 November (CEST) - Juventus president Andrea Agnelli is a serious man. He may be a little slow, but he's got guts. The Italian football club, despite rumours linking them with a swap deal with Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo, has agreed to sell defender Leonardo Bonucci to fellow Serie A club AS Roma for nearly €30m.\n\nThe Italian-Greek star was not an option for Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri's team after being dropped from the squad to face Udinese with a knee injury, but AS Roma has offered Bonucci an improved five-year deal.\n\n\"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the fans for their incredible support, as this is one of the greatest and most beautiful performances for Juventus,\" said Bonucci. \"I would like to thank my family and my teammates, among people I respect a lot. Today was not a very easy decision, but I had decided to leave. I will miss the many things that Juventus for three decades has given me. I have a great team close to my heart and all of them are incredibly important to me.\"\n\nGreece goalkeeper Giorgos Karagounis has also been linked with a summer switch to Roma.\n\nAfter making his debut for Italian club Catania in 2003, Bonucci joined the San Siro outfit just as Juventus were set to win the 2010 Serie A title. He quickly made a reputation for himself by playing a huge part in Juventus becoming the last Serie A team to win it all, winning the Scudetto on their debut against Bologna on 26 May, 2010.\n\nAs a result of his excellence and dominance, Bonucci was voted the top player of the world in the 2011 FIFA World Player of the Year Ballon d'Or, which he won two years later.\n\nFollowing the departure of the legendary manager Claudio Ranieri following two seasons in charge, Juventus announced that they had agreed an initial €80m purchase option on Bonucci. It was only confirmed in July 2012 that the former Juventus president had exercised this option, meaning that the Turin side have finally got the deal they have been seeking for the last 11 months.\n\n\"Juventus has always had a strong team with great players and we were fortunate to be able to find two exceptional players in Bonucci",
    "Campbell, 40, becomes second Liberal backbencher to call time on parliamentary career\n\nCampbell is back!\n\nThe Liberal Party of Canada has confirmed that MP Bruce Campbell has returned to his cabinet post in the House of Commons after being forced to cancel his own re-election bid last November.\n\nA party statement said Campbell is also now vice-chair of the party's election campaign. The party also said that the election campaign team for Campbell will be led by Chris Rogers, general secretary of the Ontario Liberal Party (OLP).\n\nCiting sources, the CBC reported on March 2 that Liberal leaders were unhappy with the decision and that there had been internal discussions regarding the move. On the same day, however, the House of Commons returned to the House of Commons for a scheduled two days of question period.\n\nCampbell was forced to withdraw as an MP in November as he announced in December he would no longer be a candidate. Sources said he was facing criticism from grassroots Liberal members for his failure to deliver the party's campaign promises.\n\nWhile the Liberal Party was quick to publicly praise Campbell's appointment, former Liberal MP Adam Vaughan, who lost an October 2008 by-election, said that his return to the party's cabinet was \"unnecessary.\"\n\n\"Bruce Campbell obviously has the potential to move the party forward and make things better,\" he said. \"But he's also had a long line of Liberals who've lost their seats, and they're not coming out of this game without some sort of payback.

    "EMI shares hit by profit warning as stockmarket falls to new record low\n\nThe news that global shares have fallen more than 3 per cent over the last month and are trading at historic lows is enough to send shivers down the spine of all EMIs, as well as a fair amount of fear. In its latest investor presentation, the French company which does all sorts of businesses from insurance to hotels to distribution centres to food processing company, acknowledged that this was the end of a run of success stories where investors were buying shares thinking they were'safe'. A look below the headline news reveals that the situation is dire. Despite a steady rise in profit in the past years, the share price fell 5 per cent this year and is now at a record low at 14.5p.\n\n'It's the end of a golden period and we are very much aware that the shares of all our businesses are trading at a level that is beyond a normal value,' said the company's chief executive, Emmanuel Petit. 'We are not at the bottom, but the bottom for the financial sector does not look auspicious. We think the whole sector needs a serious reassessment and we are asking our investors to take note.'\n\nThe shares have dropped in the last month largely as a result of poor news on the economy, which has seen the EU referendum result cause a decline in confidence amongst consumers, especially in the UK market. However, the most recent news also appears to have impacted negatively the fortunes of the company's insurance division. Petit said that if the economy continued the way it is going, it was likely that the insurance sector could end the year with a year-on-year loss of around 14 per cent, which would put it in the red for the first time in 20 years. This was confirmed by the recent report on the economy from the Bank of England, which saw it downgraded from'stable' to 'negative'.\n\nEMI will be hoping that the report won't last so long before it has to report earnings. Despite the recent downturn in the share price, shares continued to rise throughout the latter half of 2015 and through the first three quarters of this year, however they have now fallen back to levels lower than they were when they topped the market, over a year ago. It is also worth noting, however, that the decline in the stock price has been mainly",
    "JARED Piers Hodges has announced he will be retiring from international sport at the end of this year's Sevens Series, with the Newcastle Falcons and Australia lock announcing his final curtain call on Tuesday. In April 2014 when he was unveiled as one of Rugby World Cup organisers' nine coaches in action for the inaugural tournament, Hodges said it would see him fulfil his lifelong dream that he wished to do throughout most of his career by playing for one country. He made more than 600 Super Rugby appearances over 13 seasons in New South Wales before moving to Melbourne Storm the same year where he has been ever increasing his influence on a number of younger players which culminated in last season when he took over as head coach following Warren Gatland's resignation after their record-breaking Rugby Championship wins. Last week Hodges told his club Falcons that he had reached the age at which they felt he could no longer commit to sustained national duty, citing an increased ambition in coaching as well as injuries affecting his mobility. On Monday night after his side had lost their opening match of the series against Auckland Lions (31-27) at St James Park, he admitted he'd already made up his mind about wrapping up the curtain on 2016. \"To say I've retired wouldn't cover how much time, dedication and passion I put into this game,\" he said. Hawks head coach Rob Hewett said with the World Cup coming around again for four years Hodges's next opportunity might take place outside NSW or Australia \"but you never know\".\n\nOn top of making 521 appearances in 20+1 seasons, Mr Hodges also represented Wales in 23 Tests during that period - a feat that would have earned him a place in history alongside his fellow Welshmen Matt Mullan, Nicky Smith, David Pocock and Gethin Jenkins. Having captained them to victory at the 2005 Rugby World Cup - won as Wales were beaten 16-10 by Australia – the 26 year old also led Wales five times, including 3 golds and 4 silvers while with France. His best performance however comes under the tutelage of Wales captain Sam Warburton: in 7 Test matches together from 2013-14 at all three venues, he averaged 54% pass success, 6% turnovers and 8% offloads. That's pretty good. Also note that his pass successful ratio per game was above 80%.",

    "A controversial new system of care packages for childless couples has been slammed by ministers for a lack of transparency and for breaching a principle which the prime minister said earlier had \"greatly helped turn around\" the welfare state.\n\nThe care system was described as \"broken\" by Philip Hammond when he announced that changes to it were announced today, which will see couples facing up to seven years in prison for failing to provide their children with \"fundamental human right\" of adequate care.\n\nThe government is in secret discussions with charities and families to establish a \"revenue neutral\" scheme which will charge couples up to £5,000 a year for services to meet the \"genuine emotional and physical needs of their children as well as for their health\".\n\nMr Hammond said the new system was a way for couples to help their children to \"ensure they are growing up in a safe, stable and caring environment\".\n\nBut Labour accused the coalition government of using the current economic crisis as a pretext to turn the country into a \"guinea pig\" in a scheme they hope will be extended across the country.\n\nThe Daily Mirror understands that in the latest phase of the reforms, couples with the same income would be given the same package, but the exact amount they would pay for it would vary depending on how many children they have.\n\nThe change also means that couples who had children during the last few years would receive less support. It is believed that those families with children under three would gain more, while those with children over the age of 18 would lose out on extra help.\n\nMr Hammond said: \"Our new approach is about ensuring that families have the financial support they need to ensure their children are growing up in a safe, stable and caring environment. It is about being fair, fair to the taxpayer and fair to people, and I think it is the sensible thing to do.\"\n\nCouples could be found guilty of \"gross misconduct\" if their child support payments were \"grossly excessive\" and the minister urged the public to contact their local authorities to raise concerns.\n\nHe insisted that some couples could benefit as a result of the reforms, with the \"realistic case\" of a new mother with four children being provided with a care package worth between £7,000 and £8,500 a year.\n\n\"I think it is very",

    "Internet of Things (IoT) security firms are warning the public not to open or run their smart device's IoT application over public wi-fi networks. Researchers at Kaspersky Lab in Russia found dozens of applications that access the web, including webmail and social media services, for free when connected to public wi-fi hotspots across major cities. As the name suggests, if the app accesses your internet connection then it must be downloaded as the system will connect to the open wifi network you are on. In other cases the apps accessed the Wi-Fi but were redirected through fake VPN servers rather than your own network – and, unsurprisingly, many users fell prey to this scam. So far, Kaspersky has tested more than 20 of these scams across Russian cities and found they work best with the most popular free apps.\n\nAccording to an Ars Technica report, the malware researchers discovered was targeting various popular platforms from Android to Apple iOS devices through the App Store and Google Play Store. The Android versions are designed to target the Android 2.3.7 or higher baseband version without any additional user interface modifications, while the ones for iPhones allow developers to install modified apps with just one click. However in both instances Apple automatically removed any malicious apps installed during the first attempt because of restrictions within its mobile operating systems built upon Xcode Developer Studio. Since a modified app could potentially damage an iPhone by opening up sensitive documents to unauthorized access, Apple recommended removing and installing an official anti-malware solution from its app store in order to keep iOS secure.\n\nThe good thing about this kind of malware is that people who get scammed usually don't know anything about it until after they receive a phone call from a fraudulent company threatening legal action against them. As it happens, the majority of the infected devices have already been sold on eBay and bought used instead of fixed or repaired so there are also reports coming out of China related to those types of sales. This isn't the first time that companies have resorted to spamming fake ads like this and we've told readers before how such fraud can affect unsuspecting victims – but here comes news that puts things into perspective.\n\nThis post originally appeared on ReadWrite.",

    "A new online gift shop has opened in London, offering customers an array of gifts including jewellery and watches, as well as books, DVDs and games. The website, GiftShop.co.uk, was launched by two brothers who have been running a successful business selling clothes on eBay. They say they are now looking to expand their range of products into the world of online retailing. The site offers items ranging from £5 to £100, with prices starting at just £1.99. It also sells a wide variety of other goods such as clothing, toys, home decor and even furniture. The company's founder, David and James Hargreaves, said that they had decided to launch the site after seeing how popular it was among people who wanted to buy gifts but were not sure where to start. 'We've seen so many people buying things online,' Mr Hargreaves told BBC News Online. 'It's very easy to get started - you can search for something you like or browse through our huge selection.' He added that he hoped the site would help people find more unique gifts. 'I think we're going to be able to do some really interesting things with this,' he said. 'For example, we could offer a range of different types of jewellery, which might appeal to someone who likes to wear gold or silver. We could also sell watches, which are often expensive, but are still quite affordable.' The brothers hope to open up the site to other countries soon.",
    "QUICK-START QUICK-END QuikSwim has announced it will be launching its own line of products, including a new line of footwear and apparel called QuikSwim. The company says that the new line will include shoes, clothing and accessories designed to help athletes perform at their best in all conditions. QuikSwim's first product launch will take place on June 1st when the brand launches its first collection of footwear with the Nike Air Max 90. The shoe features a lightweight mesh upper with a rubber outsole. It also comes equipped with an integrated lacing system which allows for easy on/off functionality. The QuikSwim collection will feature three different colorways of the Nike Air Max 90, each featuring a unique design. The first two colors are black and white while the third colorway is a bright red. The QuikSwim collection will retail for $150 USD per pair.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this. I think it's pretty clear that QuikSwim is going after the sneaker market, but I don't know if they're going after the right one. If you look at the QuikSwim website, there's no mention of any other brands or lines besides the Nike Air Max 90. That's odd because QuikSwim is known as a brand that focuses on performance running shoes. They've been around since 2009 and have released several models over the years. In fact, they were the first company to release a performance running shoe with a built-in GPS tracker back in 2010. So why would they go after something like the Nike Air Max 90?\n\nIt could be that QuikSwim wants to get into the running shoe business so badly that they can't resist trying anything. But then again, maybe they just want to try something new. Either way, I hope they do well enough to keep making more shoes.",

    "A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE GALAXY A dramatic new film will tell about those who shaped how we see stars. The story begins with one man – a lonely man and a very good camera - called George, who met two people who changed his life forever. They were actors who began to take him under their wing, giving him direction, creating characters for himself that transformed in front of everyone's eyes. He would go on to become one of the world's most famous cinematographers, capturing dozens of blockbusters including Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Ghostbusters in close-up style. He worked closely by his side until he left to pursue his own ambitions. Filmmakers have been looking carefully at photographs taken during production to try and recreate what it was like to work there. After extensive analysis, they've narrowed in on just six iconic pictures which illustrate the day to day lives of actors taking part in production. With the help of a talented team of historians including author Michael Kirk, who edited the pictures into a book, you can now read their thoughts on how our images of celebrities – and actors more generally - change as the years pass before becoming a permanent record of our history. The photos were originally compiled by an unknown American photographer named Louis Dimauth (1876-1959) but when his wife Annie found them she alerted Warner Bros director Robert Richardson, who then showed them to Arthur Fellig, who had been doing some investigations of his own after learning of his father's fate. He hired New York City researcher William Devereaux to piece together the history of each image based on its original source documents. He also consulted historian David Greenberg at Yale University who dug through archives of newspaper clippings, TV news reports, books and even old studio blacklists in the hope of finding more clues about the men in these images. In 1999 David turned out the results, adding another layer of mystery and intrigue to this often-overlooked era. Some have suggested it might be the only period in human history when every single individual – male and female alike -- could be considered royalty. What happened? One might argue the answer to this riddle has been recorded already… But now – for the first time ever – all-new information comes in the form of more than 100 colour stills depicting a group of working-class performers of all races getting dressed backstage at Paramount Studios around 1931: \"",

    "'People have become paranoid,\" says Dr Richard Peebles, one of the co-authors of the paper. We've now been here for 17 months and people start talking to us about things they heard last year or even earlier.' They see us as spies by day - what a terrible thing to do, he thinks. 'But if you make them look at it objectively, that's actually probably what they want to see. If only their friends could see these extraordinary findings, we'd be laughed out of university very often.' Dr Dobbins agrees: 'Most research done in our field has never come back with conclusions because there are too many questions left open. It takes time - years, maybe decades. So the whole point was to generate something useful that no one would ever get caught doing again.' What were their results? The volcano looked remarkably similar to another nearby mountain that had erupted recently. Geologists knew volcanoes didn't lie down, but in this case the difference between the two seemed stark: the previous eruption was 300 times more extensive than the current one - about three times the volume of Mount Pelée. Also significant was how quickly they had grown since 2014; just six months went into a major volcanic explosion and within months after the second eruption a third hillside started moving up its slope. A fourth now threatens them. 'To me it looks like an eruption,' Dr Trower said. 'It looks like the volcano will be able to hold itself for a while longer, so we should expect some increase in hazard from all this activity. Now it is really quite serious.' In July 2016 the US Geological Survey (USGS) issued a level 4 evacuation notice, indicating imminent danger. Most scientific scientists have urged caution and called further work needed before reaching such drastic conclusions 'Before you panic', said Dr Molnar-Szakacs. 'Just look around you - you'll find hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens living close to Mount Thiessun. You can go outside, drive to the supermarket, shop there, sleep over at your mother-in-law's house — but there isn't any evidence we're going extinct. And I'm pretty sure it won't happen if you take the next step and blame science.' Why bother, given humans are so unlikely to threaten such a huge volcanic body? Dr Peeble dismisses the idea.

    "A British man has admitted that his weight loss mission to reach and eat all the McDonald's fast food fast food in Britain led him, as revealed on Channel 4 series The Big Fat Surprise, to binge-eat more than 18,000 pieces of crisps, cake mix and other junk food within three months.\n\nSimon Cowell's latest effort, which included five days - four of them at home - eating nothing but hamburgers and fries while living with celebrity chefs Andrew Zimmern and Jamie Oliver, became a global phenomenon when seen by some 1 billion viewers last year. However...\n\nIn February 2009 it was revealed Cowell had not been happy that his TV show, which began broadcasting in September 2008, was only broadcast in 12 countries and he needed £300k (€352k) for overseas distribution money after just six episodes. Since then, however, the programme, dubbed 'America's Worst Cook', has taken him worldwide and Cowell appeared onstage for two shows in Britain before a crowd who paid around £100 each or more for a ticket. He then toured Germany and Switzerland and received the prestigious People's Voice Award - Germany's best honour at an awards ceremony. There also were sold out concerts throughout Germany and France.\n\nTo achieve the astonishing transformation of losing 70 kilos over six months he reportedly joined up with a former restaurant supervisor and dietitian called Ian Beaumont (a pseudonym), who is well known not only in the UK but worldwide due both to his books including The Man Who Loved Burgermeister and Eat Like A Predator, as well as being the former head chef of two famous London restaurants, Le Page Restaurant and Bistro de la Paix, where The Big Fat Surprise took place.\n\nIt is feared that, upon his return to the UK, The Big Fat Surprise may not be able to go beyond its 10pm broadcast slot again and will have to close down unless he can find another channel to air the show at times that suit his schedule. A friend of Cowell recently commented, saying, \"He really doesn't know how to get off this programme so things are likely going well for him now.\" Simon said, however... It came down to a choice between staying there or coming back here because if you're living there it has been fantastic...

It is first cutting costs via its recent cost saving plan, which saw employees made redundant and managers let go.\n\nIt is also cutting production in the U.S. to cut costs, the report said. As the car industry struggles with foreign competition from Asian firms, the report said, foreign suppliers are driving down prices and putting pressure on American auto companies.\n\nHowever, GM said it expected sales to pick up in the fourth quarter of 2005.\n\nIt said it will report earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of between $3.9 billion and $3.95 billion, which would come on the backs of record sales in 2004 - $41 billion - and gains from stock sales.\n\n\"We are making important changes to improve profitability and growth,\" said GM chairman and CEO Lee Iacocca, referring to the two things that make up GM's operations.\n\n\"In 2005, we are investing in the people and products that will drive future growth.

    "A German court has ruled that former oil giant Yukos must pay $50bn (£31bn) in damages to shareholders and creditors, including Russia's state-owned energy company Gazprom. The ruling by Germany's highest appeals court comes after years of legal wrangling between Yukos and its Russian owners. It also follows an arbitration award last year which found that Yukos had been illegally nationalised. The decision could have far reaching implications for other companies involved in similar disputes with their foreign partners. In a statement, Yukos said it was disappointed by the verdict but would appeal against it. \"We are convinced that our actions were lawful,\" it added. \"We will continue to fight for justice.\" The ruling came as part of a long running dispute over who owns Yukos' assets. The company says it owes billions of dollars to investors and creditors around the world. But the Russian government claims that the company was nationalised under pressure from Boris Yeltsin during his presidency in 1991. The Russian president has repeatedly denied this.\n\nIn addition to the $50 billion figure, the court ordered Yukos to pay $1.5 billion in interest on the amount owed to shareholders and creditors. This means that the total amount due to Yukos shareholders and creditors is now $51.6 billion.\n\nYukos is one of the largest oil companies in the world, and was once one of the most successful in the world. However, it went bankrupt in 2001, and was subsequently taken over by the Russian government. Since then, the company has been trying to recover some of its losses through various lawsuits.\n\nHowever, the company has not been able to do so because of the ongoing litigation. As such, the company has been unable to pay out any dividends or share buybacks to its shareholders. Instead, it has been forced to sell off large chunks of its assets, including its stake in BP's Russian joint venture TNK-BP.\n\nAs a result, the company has seen its stock price plummet since the beginning of 2012. At the time of writing, the shares of Yukos were trading at just below $10 per share.",

    "A new study has found that the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011 caused an estimated $200 billion (£130bn) worth of damage to the country's economy, with most of it concentrated in the manufacturing sector. The report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was released on Tuesday, said the disaster had led to a sharp fall in GDP growth, as well as a rise in unemployment. It also warned that the impact would be felt for years to come. The IMF said the loss of life and property was likely to have been higher than previously thought because many people were not able to return home after the quake struck. The report said the Japanese government had spent more than $100bn on reconstruction efforts since the disaster, but added that this figure could rise further if the cost of rebuilding continues to rise.\n\nThis is a very interesting piece of information. I am sure that there are some who will argue that the losses suffered by the Japanese economy due to the earthquake and tsunami were relatively small compared to other countries' economies. However, the fact remains that the Japanese economy lost over 20% of its value during the period between March 11th, 2011 and April 15th, 2012. This means that the total amount of money that was lost due to the earthquake and tsunami was approximately $200 Billion. If we add up all the damages incurred by the Japanese economy, then we can estimate that the total amount of money lost due to the earthquake and tsunami was around $300 Billion.\n\nNow, let us look at the US economy. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the US gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.2% in 2010. In addition, the US unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in October of last year. So, the US economy did grow during the time period between March 11th, 2011 and April 15th, 2012. However, the real question is whether or not the US economy experienced any significant negative effects from the earthquake and tsunami.\n\nAccording to the BLS, the US economy lost about $500 Billion in 2010. Therefore, the total amount of money that was lost due to the earthquake and tsunami was roughly $600 Billion. Now, let us assume that the US economy experienced no negative effects from the earthquake and tsunami. Then, the total amount of money that was lost due to the earthquake and tsunami was approximately $700",

    "Banking officials say they have not seen any big moves in world markets, but investors continue to pile into US debt amid renewed concern about slowing Chinese growth and financial turmoil at home. The dollar has been drifting lower against its strongest trading partner for more than eight years, hitting a two-week low of 94.01 - well off its level just five months ago. While the global outlook remains uncertain on worries over China's economy and tensions with North Korea, it seems some currencies are doing what they can protect themselves. A basket of six major emerging economies will keep their dollar debt steady this week while sending the euro tumbling to multi-month lows of $1.1140 – its weakest since February 2013. It was the biggest percentage fall against the dollar for two, three and four weeks this year but still less negative than the slump last month that preceded Britain voting to leave the European Union. Brazil's real is down 2% against the greenback, reaching 1.5646 and its lowest point in nearly 14 months. Meanwhile Germany and France both edged down against the buck and yen respectively, making it the second week running that these two advanced nations dropped versus one another. India saw the Indian rupee hit yet another record low at 58.25 per dollar as concerns grew that the central bank could take up interest rates. With gold prices falling unexpectedly, silver fell 0.2%. Silver is often viewed as an attractive alternative due to its supply being greater than demand, though it may be a safe haven should China experience a slowdown. Gold slipped back below $1550 a troy ounce for the first time ever Wednesday after surging above $1660 earlier in August.\n\nAs Bloomberg notes, the euro has now sunk to levels never witnessed before, dropping by 7% so far in 2017, which is the largest yearly decline in all of Europe, or even Africa apart from Algeria.\n\n\nJust how deep does this latest slide need to go? According to Paul Volcker, there comes a certain point we've reached where we are \"on borrowed time.\" The former chairman of the Federal Reserve noted yesterday on CNBC's Squawk Box that a combination of political uncertainty in France, a potential downgrade of Europe's credit rating by S&P/GSCO, the eurozone sovereign debt crisis, Russia and Ukraine, Brexit, and economic weakness in Asia means we face a new phase in the long downturn in economic activity",

    "Economic growth was almost twice as strong in 2015 as in 2012, official figures show today, just as the race to replace David Cameron in the coming election focuses on how much of his promise to'make Britain a Great Britain again' can be re-kept.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.4 per cent in 2015, above the 2.1 per cent rate recorded a year earlier.\n\nThis rate was higher than any economic expansion since the second world war, with the exception of 1974.\n\nUK growth over the last 11 months was twice as fast as the 3.2 per cent recorded in the previous 12 months, and is now higher than that in the three decades before the war.\n\nThe figures confirmed that the economy grew by more than predicted in the Tory-Lib Dem post-election budget a year ago, with the Government predicting that GDP growth for the year would average just 2.9 per cent.\n\n\"The economy has seen strong growth over the summer and has continued to do so over the first six months of 2016,\" an OBR spokesperson said.\n\n\"It still remains below trend and the Chancellor has made clear that the Government remains committed to keeping the economy on the right track.\"\n\nThis is quite similar to what Osborne said a year ago. He said the economy was \"strong\" and \"set to grow faster than any other major advanced economy over the next decade\", and that while \"Britain is not yet back to the same powerhouse level as in the 1990s we still have room for more\".\n\nAlthough there have been fluctuations in the economy, like a fall in oil prices, some economists had said that the next government would probably \"need to do far more to restore economic momentum ahead of the next election,\" adding that \"the new Government needs to establish both a clear economic framework and a clear plan\" to grow the economy over time.\n\nBut the latest figures show that the economic recovery has picked up over the last 18 months, and Osborne's plan to boost the economy over the next couple years — with interest rates set to go up, unemployment under control, and public investment and support for small businesses — has been well received.\n\n\"Overall growth has been broadly consistent over the last two years, but it is being spurred by a raft of policy",

    "Former British and Welsh heavyweight boxing champion, William Llewellyn will be knighted by His Majesty, The Queen today at Buckingham Palace. (The event will take place in his honour.) Mr Llewellyn, now 79 years old, was known to millions of people throughout the world as one of the all time great heavyweight boxing champions.\n\nSir William was born in London. Like many of his generation who were born and grew up in London, his home town was an obvious place to start as a career fighter. After winning his only professional victory on the streets of the capital in 1960, Sir William moved to Liverpool to work as a plumber.\n\n\nDespite some early troubles, the fight game soon became the second career he chose to pursue after working. His second bout on this side of the pond was in London against George Burns, and even at the age of 33, he looked and sounded the part. Burns was also known as a superb striker in the ring and this lead to an unwise decision by The London Times to not provide a handicap in the fight, which resulted in one round for the home team and a five minute delay for betting windows to open throughout the world. The next time Sir William faced to the ring was in the United States where he defeated the young John J. Fagan, a future four division world champion and also a man who many thought should have been inducted into the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter the first two encounters, Sir William moved to the US to work for the US military. When the United States entered World War II, he was given the opportunity to fight in Italy. There he defeated several top ranked European boxers, including the reigning world champion Joe Louis. He then moved on to meet the very impressive American champ Tony Karpets, who had won his world title with a perfect 7-0 record, against who he gave the perfect 3-1 victory over in the final of the New York International in 1945.\n\n\nSir William retired from boxing in 1947 but still maintained his love of sport. He ran the New York State Boxing Commission and his great compassion for the poor won him many fans. His last outing was in the fall of 1951, but his love for boxing lingered on. It is thought that he retired with an overwhelming desire to go on a world tour to raise money for wounded servicemen.",
    "BANK VOTED 8-1 TO NOT RATE CHANGE AT CHEAPER RATE\n\nOne bank voted against a 4.8 per cent annual rise as the government's attempt to keep lenders on a tight leash was dealt another blow with the prospect of a rate freeze.\n\nThe Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will not change the base rate to 4.8 per cent at its next meeting until June 2017, the MPC announced after the meeting ended, despite a growing clamour from the majority of banks for a move ahead of inflation.\n\nA number of banks have publicly backed a rate increase if inflation hits 3 per cent, after the Bank trimmed the cash rate last month to 0.5 per cent.\n\nThe number of banks publicly in favour of a change is likely to have increased after the vote, with the Bank indicating that they will be allowed to move rates from 0.25 per cent without the fear of needing a vote.\n\nHowever, the Bank did not explicitly rule out a rate rise, suggesting the committee is yet to make a final decision.\n\nAt its meeting on Wednesday, eight of the MPC's nine members voted to keep the base rate unchanged.\n\nFour – Ian McCafferty, Andrew Haldane, Graeme Leach and Esther George – voted to raise rates.\n\nFour voted to keep base rate unchanged\n\nThree abstain from voting\n\nFour didn't vote\n\nFive said they had not heard about the decision\n\nThe remaining member – Ramez Menghal – was absent and his absence was not explained at the meeting, leading to speculation that he could have abstained.\n\nThere is now increasing pressure on the Bank to change the current stance.\n\nA total of 42 members voted in favour of a rate rise, with only three votes against. Those votes were split by the Liberal Democrats' one abstention.\n\nThe MPC, the bank's seven-member board and the Governor all agree on a return to higher rates, and this week's announcement has led to speculation that the committee will back a change from its current 0.5 per cent base policy.\n\nThe Bank's interest rate decision is the fourth time it has been faced with an argument that the Bank are not raising rates but will only lower them if inflation hits",

    "In an exclusive interview with BBC Radio Manchester, former Rangers defender Jimmy Greaves spoke about his time at Ibrox and the current state of Scottish football. In total, he has managed 36 Scottish clubs as well as being involved in English management as a player and manager during spells with Charlton Athletic (1982-89), West Bromwich Albion (-1990), Wimbledon (1991-) and Manchester United (-1992). He admitted when he represented Scotland it was tough but now he feels its easier than in previous eras because there's less pressure and expectations – which is great for younger players. The veteran also revealed that Scottish referees are \"screwed\" – so much so that refereeing standards in England are not good enough anymore to warrant calling many matches – and he believes that one reason why some clubs have moved away from English football is because they could be more effective at playing games at a higher standard. 'At times they just don't know what to do,' he said. 'There shouldn't be any problems with my generation.' Greaves also touched on some of his favourite European moments and cited Barcelona as especially important – particularly their 7/14 win over Juventus (a 4-3 aggregate extra-time victory) where they led 3-0 late in the game but eventually conceded four goals inside 90 minutes. Greaves said: 'If you look back to Barcelona against Juventus [in the 2014 Champions League final] that was like watching two teams go at each other without the ball. They didn't play well. You saw them trying to score in the last minute and never getting close against such pace. 'Even at 6th level teams can learn from what we did. That showed us what players would actually take to a high level really quick! The quality was shocking – and still is. If you look back to [Barcelona's 7/14 Champions League defeat by PSG] it still shocks me today!' Greaves admits Rangers have been knocked out of Europe twice and points to the need for greater communication between the manager and players, saying: 'They can communicate better. We went over the pitch during this year's cup tie and I asked him how our play had started; our system, the way I wanted us to play, his vision of what he wanted…It should come from within.' But despite struggling in recent seasons for league positions, says Greaves, he remains confident that Rangers will get back",

    "Internet thieves are stepping up their attacks against hospitals and banks as hackers try to steal sensitive details and personal data including names, social security numbers and banking passwords in an escalating cyber threat.\n\n\nAccording to recent reports, there has been a marked increase in data theft by scammers. In addition, financial institutions were also targeted during what appears to be their worst ever cyber attack on November 29 where over $400m was stolen from more than 3,600 accounts at JPMorgan Chase's UK branch. The hack is suspected to have been carried out via phishing emails originating in China. On top of that more than 2,000 US and British government agencies were caught in one of the most sophisticated phishing scams in history which forced bank employees to verify personal information held on corporate systems in order to access accounts and make withdrawals before it was discovered.\n\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced that it had shut down illegal trading networks involved in massive hacking of hundreds of thousands of customers who had given them money for stocks and commodities. According to a spokesman for DoJ, the network known as Ponzi scheme operator known as Genesis Financial Group was being driven by high leverage betting activity, which posed serious potential risk to investors such as pension funds who believe they will earn high returns from investments made by the group. At least 14 states and several American cities have passed laws requiring online traders to register with authorities and regulators in order to avoid similar scams against people hoping to invest in the securities markets.\n\n\nWhile some firms are trying to beef up their cybersecurity capabilities by installing firewalls and other anti-spam technology, others remain in the dark about the tactics used by cybercriminals whose attacks are rapidly improving. A recent report by security firm Symantec suggested that phished emails targeting healthcare companies had significantly increased, likely due to the rising popularity of so-called \"cloud hosting\", or moving internet files in the cloud rather than installing and maintaining copies on servers on premises themselves.\n\nBut just because all of those websites, servers or even computer code may not have malicious code inside or run an exploit (malicious software intended to break your system), doesn't mean you can't get hacked. But don't worry too much just yet! If I wrote \"If I write \"If I write this\", though, I might get attacked. If this is really true then that",
    "My wife and I will be watching an NBA game (we are NBA fans, BTW) tonight...a Spurs/Magic playoff match-up...so we decided to go out dressed like the stars (the same team as my wife). We were told on the way there that you have to wear socks over your shoes...and we both had to put them on! I was kind of excited after I realized this as I'm a foot athlete and my feet are really good and didn't want to damage anything lol So when we got here we went into our dressing room area where they show different thongs. First one was tiny which barely covered my dick, but still no problem right? Wrong! As I pulled the leg up my penis popped pretty clear through (just a little bit). The next pair was even smaller and covering very essentially nothing! Not only did the material make my manhood pop quite clearly through, it made the feeling all the more awkward because everything else around me was covered and I couldn't see through the thing at all. They also said these should cover just over half the vagina...that's ridiculous, you guys need to come up with something better than that already! In the meantime I kept thinking the whole time how these should cover the actual vulva area too, as the thong does not properly wrap in the slightest around the clitoris because every time my erect member is pressed against the fabric it slips forward and down a small notch right...which also leaves some nice open space if someone walks by and just sits there for any period of time haha! To sum the experience up. There needs to be change for this type of clothing...nowadays there's not. At least give us a sock or two I don't care if you think this is weird...but I'm telling ya, you're exposing a lot of stuff by leaving us naked. What if there weren't cameras anywhere near us.

    "This morning, I was disappointed to see some \"shared wall\" posts and photos popping up on all the blogs. My first opinion was that maybe this had something to do with the fact Facebook (perhaps in response to user criticism) removed or limited more features for some users who used Shared Walls last month. However, as time has passed, it appears other sites have started using these shared photo walls for different purposes--some simply share related content like artworks or fashion -- while others appear built to support specific businesses or events. So I dug deeper into the sharing practices to uncover why this change was made. The reason shared wall posts became less prevalent is because those are not the types of images we choose to share most often.\n\n\nIf you visit facebook, just look at your feed; there's probably one. If you browse r/pics, one of those likely will make the cut too. Your average \"photo post\" would require one image if viewed through my eyes alone, but I think about 10 percent are photos. At this point, the idea seems so silly--what makes me want to send you photos through the mail for nothing? What makes me want to post them up here when your site won't let me submit this kind of thing for free?! Anyway, it becomes apparent that sharing images isn't really what people want to do on reddit anymore even though it remains an integral part as our overall community. Instead, I found another trend. As many sharers mentioned while commenting on my previous posts, one common source is mobile devices. For instance, in today's r/gif, I received over two hundred comments on Reddit from folks pointing out how I'd posted pictures and GIFs. This same dynamic played out for several other submissions I saw with the added bonus of being shared by Facebook. These folks were sharing things they knew they could post easily and regularly around their networks when browsing Reddit. Why? Because sharing and posting gifs via mobile devices wasn't such an intimidating task! They didn't need tools or knowledge to use a simple share button. And since a picture is worth 1K words, sharing more than one animated GIF is clearly better value.\n\nSo what can we learn from the rise and fall of shared wallers on Reddit? Well, first and foremost, you can definitely expect new posts to become increasingly interesting once they hit the front page of their respective subreddits. Second, shared",

A collection of nude photographs? Or maybe just a bag containing thousands of dollars worth of goods stolen while they were travelling through customs?\n\n\nHere are some responses: \"My friend went to Kanyetothe in Philly yesterday and got something great and a little funny which he bought him off the guy he did the deal with but the guy turned out not to be who he said he was,\" user ck_wtf posted. Someone identified as rdft wrote of his experiences at Paris' Parc de la Villette: \"I paid over $50 for 6 pieces (4 hats) which the French guy sold me for around 600 Euros… The items in question were never released and most likely will not be released unless someone takes legal action against KANYETOTHE… I guess my conclusion will be there'll probably never be anything of value like that in France again.\" It would take several hours until someone in /r/GIFS took up the challenge.

    "I have been having dreams about a large empty field, near a pond that I often go to swim in. It's been over half an hour now and so far nothing is happening outside the window at night, but during the day something will be just the two of us lying on the ground by the water, looking up towards the sky. There were things growing out of it which had once looked like a small dog/kitty but then became human. The little girl who lives there keeps making strange noises when we come out of the sun or if she's getting into trouble, she'll cry and beg for my mom and dad to get her inside. When she's asleep she just sits with me staring up at the sky for hours until one day all sounds stopped and nothing happened but no one was dead. So I guess she died somewhere between 3 am and 6am today…\n\nAdvertisements",
    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've seen it mentioned on several other forums and blogs. It's an interesting question that deserves more attention. The short answer is no. There are currently no funded PhD programs in the United States. This is true for all countries except Canada (which has a few). In fact, there are only two places where you can get a PhD without going to graduate school. One is at a university or college, and the other is through a fellowship program. These fellowships are usually run by private organizations, such as the National Science Foundation, which provides funding for research projects. They're also often called \"grants\" because they come with strings attached. For example, one grant might require that you spend 3 years working on your project, while another might require that you work for 2 years after graduation. So, even though you may have gone to grad school, you still don't have a degree. You could go to a community college and take classes, but you won't be able to apply for any grants until you finish those courses. If you want to do something like a Ph.D., you'll need to go to a graduate school. But again, these aren't paid degrees. Most people who go to graduate school end up doing some sort of teaching or research. And then, once you have a doctorate, you can apply for jobs. But you will probably never make enough money to pay off your student loans.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, first of all, it means that you can't just walk into a university and ask for a job. That would be illegal. Instead, you'd have to go through a process known as \"admission.\" Basically, you'd have to submit a letter of intent to study somewhere, and then wait for a year or so for them to decide whether or not you should be admitted. Then, when you finally got accepted, you'd have to start taking classes. After that, you'd have to wait another year or so for your dissertation to be finished. Finally, you'd have to wait another year or so for your results to be published. All of this takes time and effort.\n\nBut here's the thing: most people don't bother applying for these things. Why? Because they think that they'll never get in. Or, they think that",

    "I am an American citizen who has lived in Turkey for over 10 years, and I have been living here since 2004. My wife and I are both Turkish citizens, but we were born in the United States. We have two children, one of whom was born in Turkey and the other in the U.S., so we are not technically dual nationals. However, our kids are all U.S. citizens by birth, and they will grow up with the same rights as any other U.S. citizen. The only thing that makes us different is that my wife's parents are Turkish, while mine are American. So when it comes to voting, we can vote for either candidate, but if you ask me which candidate I would rather support, I would say Hillary Clinton because she supports women's rights more than Trump does. But I'm sure there are many people out there who feel the exact opposite way about this issue.\n\nAs someone who has lived in Turkey for almost ten years, I know what it feels like to live under a dictatorship. It's hard to imagine how difficult life must be for those who don't have the luxury of being able to travel abroad or even go outside their own country. And yet, I've never seen anyone criticize Hillary Clinton for her stance on abortion. In fact, I've never heard anyone suggest that Donald Trump should be criticized for his position on abortion. Why? Because he doesn't want to ban abortions. He wants to make sure that women have access to safe and legal abortions. That's why he opposes bans on late-term abortions.\n\nSo why do some people think that banning abortions is okay? Well, let's look at the facts. According to Planned Parenthood, there are approximately 1.5 million abortions performed each year in America. Of these, roughly half are done after 20 weeks of pregnancy. If you take away the abortions performed after 20 weeks, then you're left with around 600,000 abortions per year. This means that roughly 2% of all abortions are performed after 20 weeks. Now, if you take away the abortions performed after 20 weeks, then you're left with around 400,000 abortions per year. That means that roughly 0.2% of all abortions",
    "Let's all get comfortable with changing names in our daily lives. We want to start naming our friends and family the first two letters of our first names. We want people to use our new names and don't care if they've never heard of us before. Just use the name we want to use and change the middle name. I bet anyone in the entire world would feel weird that way.\n\nI know that sounds ridiculous. Here's a couple more reasons why:\n\n–It's pretty simple — people are used to hearing one name. One name is so widely shared that when you name yourself something that's not a regular name (like \"Ivan\") there's a heightened sense of disconnect between the person having that name and his or her actual identity.\n\n–You can feel it. You get uncomfortable a lot when people start changing their names. It feels more like you're being forced to adopt a new role, to \"pass\" as something else. But if you choose a name that's been given to a person, and then that person names himself or herself after that first name, I think you'll feel pretty comfortable.",
    "I'm not sure if I've ever been so depressed in my life, and I don't think I'll ever be able to get over it. It started on Friday when I was driving home from work and got pulled over by police for speeding. They asked me what I was doing and why I had such a high blood alcohol level (BAC) and I told them that I'd just finished watching The Dark Knight Rises. They said they were going to take me to jail but then decided against it. Instead they gave me a breathalyzer test which came back as.08. That means I have a BAC of 0.08% or more. I was arrested and taken to the station where I spent the next two hours being questioned about everything I could remember about the movie. I couldn't even remember the name of the character played by Christian Bale. After spending an hour with the cops I was released without charge. I went home and tried to sleep but couldn't stop thinking about how stupid I looked. I felt like I was going to throw up every time I closed my eyes. I didn't want to go out anymore. I called my mom who lives in Florida and she drove down to see me. She took me to the hospital where I stayed until Sunday night. My parents are both doctors and they're very understanding. They also let me stay with them while I was there. I still can't believe that I'm actually here. I feel like I'm going crazy. I haven't eaten anything since Saturday morning. I've only slept four hours total since Friday. I'm scared to leave my room. I keep having nightmares about Batman and his henchmen coming after me. I'm afraid to go outside.

Every Sunday I was supposed to go into church with my parents, I would always say ok if you'd just pick me up later or that I had some problems with the sermon but nope they wouldn't accept this. Just as soon as I said this they were so upset by what I was telling them that I don't think I could ever bring myself out right there in front of people without my mom scolding me about my heart and how bad it felt! Anyway, we ended up going to church anyway. We usually prayed and talked before getting down. This Sunday my mom finally gave me a call asking me why i wasn't there yet. So, I tried saying okay but she didn't allow it. She told me to wait till we got home because I am such an idiot sometimes. While waiting in my room I felt that I was a god awful person and should know better. So after a minute or two of struggling through it I went away disappointed. Not long after though my Mom called again after saying her husband and I got off work and wanted to get something to eat before heading back to their place to watch television together. As usual when someone goes off to help go get food and things are packed up in preparation for them for dinner, I was nowhere to be found. This time with that phone call came my Dad calling telling me he was coming over in a little while (this happened everytime dad called him) after checking around his house i heard his car pull up with a bunch kids in it. To make matters worse he decided right then &there to take me on top of it, like they actually made a plan like that when none of us were able to come up WITH ideas beforehand or even talk to the adults regarding anything. He started driving towards our old neighborhood. The car ride took an hour- maybe more. Then as we drove through the empty streets, all these familiar faces greeted on the opposite side by my dad: my Aunt Judy(my other favorite aunt in the world), Grandpa, Uncle George, uncle Bob, etc. etc. At one point he even stopped and shouted hello to me as his wife & 3 year daughter looked in amazement behind us.

    "You're probably wondering why I've decided to share this. Well let's face it, not all men have the opportunity to explore their sexuality in a public place. In some ways this is a blessing in disguise, but I believe that the fact that this is a blog post means that it has to be spoken.\n\nWhen I was in my late teens and early 20s, an unfortunate incident happened in a public park. As I was walking with a female friend near the main entrance of our local park one night, two male teens from behind me started to chase after us. My friend and I panicked and in an attempt to get away my friend decided to take a nude walk. While I followed, I was unaware that my actions might cause these two guys to go away, but as I made my way towards the forest behind the gate- the boys had passed by and were running around a deadfall. By the time I was in a safer location, there were two of them running towards us. A female voice called out from the bush \"You're wasting everyone's time, just take a picture.\" My friend started to run, but by that time they had already gotten into position, and I couldn't see clearly what they were attempting to do. I wasn't scared enough to keep running, so instead I made sure to get as far away as I could without crossing the boundary. They both ran at me trying to punch me, they swung at me with their arms, I was struck in the eye several times as I rolled around, and when they finally finished hitting me, I rolled over on the ground. As I lay there, completely out cold, I heard one of the guys scream \"Are you fucking kidding me?!\" I got up and began walking towards my friend's side of the park. I turned around to see them, and they were making a run for it. I immediately turned to watch them as they continued to run, and to try and get my friend to follow. I don't know that I could've got them all, but I was definitely in some degree of shock and panic. There was a man who was standing by the forest behind the park who happened to be a friend of my father's. He told me to get in his car and go back, but from where he was I had no idea of where I was. He helped me navigate inside it, and",
    "\"This is a difficult day for me and a difficult subject for me to write about. Over the years I have heard a lot of stories about how my personality has caused me suffering in this life, and how it makes my life and my family difficult. I have heard that this is because I'm an introvert, and therefore I am not able to empathize with other people—though I do my best. I have heard that I have very little empathy, because I'm not interested in the feelings and emotions of the other—though I try to understand and feel what others are feeling but usually can't make sense of it. I have heard that I am so self-focused that I only care about myself and never anyone else.\n\nAnd over and over and over again, I've heard this—always with the same name. I think I have a name for it now. It is called empathy bias.\n\nI find myself a very uninteresting person.\n\nEmpathy bias has always been my problem, and I see it every day in my life—from a friend in a bad mood when they lose a fight. From having a tough exam to thinking of getting a job that I love, and feeling that I can do as much work as they are expected to do, when the other person is happy, or a year into a relationship and I can't understand why they don't want to end it. I find it in the people around me with no explanation, in people who seem to be the same on the inside but on the outside are completely different inside and out, on the people I've had the opportunity to meet but they're not like the people I knew, and in some people, I can't really connect. It is something I've been looking to change—and slowly.\n\nSo I'll start with the simplest thing you can do here: make yourself more interesting by connecting with other people. Just remember that people are just like you too. Have fun with it—you are good at it.\n\nWhat other people think can be as much of a turn-off as what they are. That is why I would love to hear what you think on this subject.\n\nAriel\n\nComments\n\ncomments",

    "I've been playing since launch and have had some pretty good experiences with my favorite class, the Engineer. I was hoping to see more of that in game but it seems like there's less of me than before. The drop off has been noticeable for me as well. It feels like I'm not getting any better at what I do or am just not doing as much as I used to. I don't know if this is because I'm not using the new weapons or maybe I'm just not being as effective as I used to be. Either way, I feel like I'm losing out on something by not playing as much as I used to. I think I need to get back into the groove of things. I'll keep you posted!\n\nThis is an interesting observation. In the past, I've noticed that when I play a lot, I tend to perform better. This may be due to the fact that I'm trying to improve my performance rather than simply having fun. However, I also notice that when I play less, I tend to perform worse. So, does this mean that I should stop playing? Not necessarily. If I want to continue improving, then I will need to find ways to make myself play more often. For example, I could try to practice more with my current weapon loadout. Or, I could try to use different classes. But, I would still need to find ways to increase my overall skill level.\n\nIn addition, I'd like to point out that I haven't played Overwatch for very long. I started playing around two weeks ago and have only logged about 20 hours so far. That means that I'm probably not performing as well as other players who have been playing for longer periods of time. I can't say for sure whether this is because I'm not playing enough or because I'm not practicing enough. I hope that I can figure out how to fix these issues soon.",

    "Hey there. I wanted to get the response to the new meme being floating around this sub. I don't often ask for help (except from people I know who are usually interested in helping, and even then it's hard), but wanted to ask if anybody had any general experience with \"but you have to love your mother.\" You can find a link to this as well as the meme in comments here. I can't find any recent media about the meme, so if anybody knows of any videos or anything about it maybe you can contribute?\n\nAlso here is the full text of the post that she linked to in her second comment.\n\nIn a recent episode of The Daily Show, Stephen Colbert interviewed Steve Jobs about a possible future Apple store in China — an idea I've written about, here, here, and here. The Chinese government has been in a bit of a tizzy about it ever since. Colbert went into great detail about it, even making a joke about how Apple won't be allowed to sell iPhones inside the Apple store. The Chinese government isn't the only country to have an issue with the stores — there are also Vietnam, Taiwan, and Indonesia, among others.\n\nAs it turns out, there are even users within Apple who are against the store. On Reddit, users are sharing pictures and discussing whether or not they will buy something or not, based on Apple's decision. Below are some of the comments on the reddit thread, which is titled \"But you have to love your mother.\"\n\nThis post has been adapted from the author's \"You can run, but you can't hide\" Tumblr.",
    "I'm not sure if this is an actual problem or just me being overly sensitive, but I've been noticing that when I use the word \"feminist\" in conversation with people who are not feminists, they tend to get defensive and say things like \"well you're not really a feminist because you don't believe in equality between men and women.\" This is true, but it's also completely irrelevant. The fact that someone doesn't think feminism is about equality between men and women does not mean that they aren't a feminist. It means that they have different ideas on what feminism actually is. And those ideas can be very different from each other. So let's talk about some definitions.\n\nFirst off, there are two main types of feminism: social justice and political feminism. Social justice feminism focuses on issues such as gender inequality, racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. Political feminism focuses on issues such as economic inequality, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism, ableism, etc. Both kinds of feminism focus on the same basic principles, but they differ in how they go about achieving them. For example, social justice feminists would argue that we should fight for equal pay for equal work, while political feminists would argue that we should fight for more equitable distribution of wealth.\n\nSocial Justice Feminists\n\nSocial justice feminists believe that all human beings deserve equal rights regardless of their race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, class, ability, age, disability, or any other characteristic. They believe that these rights must be granted by society at large, rather than through laws passed by politicians. In addition, they believe that these rights should be extended to everyone without regard to their gender, ethnicity, sexuality, or any other characteristic.\n\nPolitical Feminists\n\nPolitical feminists believe that all human beings deserve equal rights regardless of their race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, class, ability, age, disability, or any other characteristic.

    "I love the look of the Airpod 2 – and I love the feel of the Airpod 3 – but they both run about half the cost of the Freebud. I was so curious as to what would happen if I used my own money to buy both. What should I expect to pay? What are my savings? Is it worth it?\n\nI decided to purchase two units – one to use with the Freebud 3, and one for my own use. The Freebud is an all-in-one, Bluetooth enabled, charging cradle/transmitter for your cell phone. I am using the Airpod 2, which is a more compact, and more cost effective solution for my needs.\n\nWhat I learned (and may or may not make you want to buy an Airpod 3):\n\nThe Airpod 2 costs about the same as the Freebud 3 $50. I got the smaller Airpod 2 because I wanted an integrated mount (which is an option on the Freebud) that was also compatible with my Garmin GPS. It's cheaper to buy 2 units rather than 1 unit that's not going to work with my GPS. The smaller Freebud costs $25 if you want to use the Garmin GPS. If you want a unit that's compatible with your cell phone, the unit is $45. If you choose to go for the Garmin mount and just use your phone for the majority of your rides, you can get the larger size of the Freebud for under $30.\n\nIf you have the ability, you can save money (and get more features) by using the Airpod 2 instead.\n\nThe AirPod 3 costs about the same as the Freebud 3 just a very little bit more. I got the larger unit because I wanted a mount that was compatible with my phone (with a larger screen) and because I didn't want to have to add another mount that was also going to connect to anything.\n\nI would recommend reading the full reddit post, it's a great read!\n\nSo let's start with the actual unit:\n\nThe Freebud is very similar to the airpod product that had been discontinued. It's more compact, and it's still water resistant. I still would recommend it because of it's great battery life (which can last hours,",
    "\"On Friday I accidentally downloaded a program called \"Doxbin-NGer\", which I had never heard of but which I had not seen in any reviews (even of pirated programs). The description said the program was about \"identifying files you didn't want elsewhere on the Internet\". Apparently \"Doxbin\" does exactly that for a very simple purpose: it deletes files without your permission. This isn't a program with an advanced or novel purpose, just one that can make your browsing experience as unpleasant as possible.\n\nThis program has the interesting feature that its uninstaller cannot be undone. It works immediately: when you click on the \"Uninstall\" button, you are presented with a link to the program's official site, which then removes the program. The link also deletes any data on the machine it links. I do not know enough to judge this part of the program's operation; however, I see no reason for people to install it, since it causes nothing of value. It would be hard for me to use a program like this for the intended purpose: to get files I didn't want otherwise.\"\n\nThe Pirate Bay's founder, the anonymous admin known as The Pirate Bay, has been known to use viruses, malware, and other malicious software and apps to attack users' computers.

    "I'm not sure if this is an actual question, but I thought it was worth asking. The answer is that they would both be capitalist and socialist. In fact, there are many ways to define capitalism and socialism. For example, one could say that capitalism is when all property is privately owned (i.e., no government owns anything). Socialism is when the state owns everything. So, for example, if you own your house, then you're a capitalist. If you don't own your house, then you're a socialist. But if you own your house, then you're a capitalist. And so on. There's also another way to define capitalism and socialism. It's called the \"free market.\" This means that everyone has equal access to resources, including land, capital, labor, etc. That's why we have markets. A free market is where people can trade their goods and services with each other without any restrictions. So, for example, if you want to buy some apples, you go into a store and ask for them. You pay whatever price the store owner wants to charge you. Then he sells you apples at whatever price he thinks is fair. Now, let's say that the store owner doesn't like selling apples at $1 per apple. He might decide to sell them at $2 per apple. Or maybe he'll only sell them at $3 per apple. Whatever the case may be, you still get what you paid for. So, in this scenario, you've got two different types of capitalists. One type is a capitalist who makes money by selling his product at whatever price he chooses. The other type is a capitalist who makes money by buying his product at whatever price he chooses. Both types of capitalists make money by selling their products. They just do it differently. So, in this hypothetical situation, you'd have two different kinds of socialists. One type is a socialist who buys his product at whatever price he chooses. The other type is a socialist who makes money by selling his product at whatever price he chooses. Both types of socialists make money by selling their products. They just do it differently. So, in this hypothetical situation, you'd have two different kinds of capitalists.

    "A very nice way we could try out a new feature on Valorant right now would be adding some sort of verification/approval system. Right now, there's no real reason why a person may not get their report verified unless you have them do extremely stupid things such as talking about sex with themselves or sharing information that might reveal private matters such as medical conditions. This feature would give us tools so that it doesn't matter what sort of information gets shared in public forums, only if the person sending you the link is actually who you think he/she is! I believe this would probably reduce many of the trolls, but it makes you wonder just how well it'd work.

    "I'm in my early 20s and have been dating for over two years now. I've had a few girlfriends, but none that really stood out to me. One day, I was at work and saw this girl on the street. She looked pretty hot, so I decided to talk to her. We started talking and she asked if we could hang out sometime. I said sure, and then we went back to her place. After hanging out with her for a bit, I realized that she wasn't as into me as I thought she would be. So I told her that I didn't want to date anyone else right now because I wanted to see what it felt like to be with someone who actually liked me. She seemed okay with that, so we hung out again. This time, she invited me to come over to her house later that night. When I got there, she was sitting on the couch watching TV. I sat down next to her and we talked for a while. Then she asked me if I'd like to watch some movies with her. I agreed, and we watched a couple of them. It turned out that she was very into kinky stuff, and she showed me how to tie up guys and stuff. She also gave me a blowjob, which I enjoyed immensely. Afterwards, we went to bed together. The next morning, I woke up to find her naked on top of me. She told me that she had an idea for something fun to do tonight. She pulled off my pants and panties and tied my hands behind my back. She took off her shirt and bra and put on a pair of black thong panties. She then proceeded to give me a hand job. I loved every second of it. She then let me take control of the situation by fingering myself until I came all over her face. She then licked my cum off her lips and swallowed it. She then told me that she wanted to fuck me, and I said yes. She fucked me hard and fast, and I came several times. She then told me that she needed to get ready for school, so we stopped fucking and just lay there for a little while. She then got dressed and left. I fell asleep after that. I woke up the next morning feeling good. I couldn't believe how great sex had been. I knew that I had made a mistake by",
    "I am a currently enrolled film & television student at Florida State University. I have been trying to raise money over the past two months to fund a multi piece film project. In order to fund the project, I have to spend money over the next few months since I have a ton of expenses. The majority of this money will go towards my travel, food, and other basic needs such as rent, insurance, rent, taxes, etc. The remaining amount will cover the cost of marketing the film as well as producing and uploading the film. Most of this money will go towards the following: The Film Lab - This will serve as a home base for the film and I will have studio space and a number of tools that will provide a platform to share the film. I have already acquired rental equipment and a small crew. Additional funds will be used to rent additional space, obtain editing equipment and a camera. I plan to shoot in 35mm film stock at first but I aim to transition to Cinerama and film stock with the help of the Lab. The Film Lab has already set up a number of productions.\n\nThe Kickstarter Campaign - This campaign will be in order to cover all the items above, as well as some things that I've been lacking in this process. The film and film props will be donated to me by the film makers. I can't provide the costumes and props without their permission.\n\nFilming - I've been planning out where I will be shooting and what props I will need. I've already received quotes from several companies to shoot on location of my location.\n\nPost Processing - I have purchased a ton of equipment to do my post production on location. I have a large number of color correction and retouching tools to use. I have already begun retouching some of my film. This Kickstarter will cover the costs of that.\n\nVideocamera - I need to buy a good videocamera to help record everything and to help edit the film.\n\nLarger Camera - I have already purchased the large camera that I initially planned for the film. I would then shoot the film in standard digital video with a very professional production value.\n\nThis is the film that I have been in talks with.

    "Lately I'm feeling very weird, like maybe it's not my mind trying to push me out into reality but something else… There were times when even thinking about death would make me feel really bad and scared but not on purpose, no sudden panic attacks, nothing. I was thinking like crazy for most of last night as well then at some point everything went cold again (I guess I slept through the lights going off). Anyway today after waking up this morning I felt fine, then again around lunch time during one of those periods where everything felt all wet and stuff I felt sick and it started to look like I had been in a big messy struggle. But then things got a bit easier right? Oh right no that wasn't normal either, I think now there are three scenarios that are playing out simultaneously (which sounds weirdly impossible but is actually completely possible) and I don't know which I will be able to deal with first so just sit down for now with your back against the door, if you want to hear what would happen next go ahead and listen 🙂 I'll explain each thing in sequence, hopefully this makes sense. You could start by imagining yourself inside a bathtub at your house, and you can see every little detail. Or you could imagine having a huge battle royale fight happening at a public pool – there are so many pools all fighting against each other and the whole thing is taking place under water but not all the places have to be submerged. Next imagine being somewhere really warm outdoors, or indoors (maybe a garden, kitchen sink or an elevator/couch/etc if you're still a basement dweller). Your friend is standing outside and he suddenly turns around to look at you and asks why don't you come in. Another person comes into sight, he is saying all sorts of random words and making gestures while talking with his arms folded. Then someone drops something, turns around to face you and says \"Hey let me check what's behind here\" and leaves. The other two people turn towards him and ask why didn't you try to open or something but they simply say okay and leave as well.

    "I am 25 years old. I got fat and was bullied as a kid. At first a bunch of the kids were mean to me, but over time it became more serious. I did not talk to anybody for years.

We haven't spoken since.\n\nI had a conversation with my wife about it. After a couple of days of silence, she said in jest that we need to talk to him now! I said ok, and then after a few e-mails, he said he didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't get it. I didn't go to him, just emailed him. It wasn't good.\n\nI did a google search for him and saw in the beginning of the \"about\" section that his ex is a lawyer. She has many lawyers. She has a company so I know her.

    "I like our present ISP and have some issues with it, but when you start getting into these plans and their tiers and tiers-up, your going beyond being satisfied and having been a customer.

I should point out here that there are multiple sources of information regarding Comcast bandwidth management, and it varies significantly among them (not to mention between devices). My general feeling is that the company is definitely experimenting with network management policies--though all things being equal it tends for a lot of people to produce net favorable effects. It may sometimes backfire for customers--especially over broadband services such as FiOS where more advanced QoS can prevent problems if management mechanisms work. The first part is aimed at explaining why this matters in practical terms and how it could affect you, while the second part is meant to offer advice, best practices, and suggestions about dealing with congestion on your own ISP (or with new ISPs)--all of which will hopefully aid other users in finding common ground so there won't be another Internet meltdown like the one the last few months created.",

The Ivy League offers what most high schools offer for free, it is easy to get into, even moreso for those of us who are from low income environments.

This isn't necessarily bad; it just means that our perception of ourselves as individuals will change when we find someone who fits into our image of what we want.\n\nThis is why I believe that many people feel uncomfortable around those who are polyamorous. They see themselves as being different than their partners, and therefore they feel uncomfortable around them. It's because they've been taught that they should only date other people who look like them. And if you're not attracted to people who look like you, then you must be gay! Or something!\n\nSo, here's my advice: Accept yourself. You're not the same person you were yesterday, and you never will be again. If you're attracted to more than one person at once, then that's fine. But if you're attracted to only one person, then stop trying to fit in with everyone else. Stop trying to make your partner happy. Stop trying to please everyone else. Just be yourself.\n\nAnd if you still feel uncomfortable around people who are polyamorous, then maybe you need to reevaluate your own beliefs about relationships. Maybe you need to start thinking about what makes you happy. Maybe you need to learn to love yourself first before you try to fix anyone else.",
    "How do you feel about the job(s) of technical theatre artist? In your view, what role of technical theatre (a) could be most desirable, (b) most plausible, (c) most enjoyable, or (d) most reasonable to start off with with the intention of learning more about technical theatre, possibly working in that industry or at that level, and then, having done so, taking a new job with the intention of furthering your career, or retiring with a pension/career level at a reputable company? (I've broken out the most valid options, with many responses, below.)\n\nMany of you responded that you'd like a career in technical theatre as well, but feel the roles of performer and director are not the best fit for you, so that's the path I'll walk here. I'll go through each and every possible answer, and I hope you'll take a minute or two to do the same when making your own selections.\n\nA few of the common responses in what I'd consider to be the top three choices\n\nMost Likely: Technician of the future\n\nMany of these replies say I want to perform in the future (this is often the \"me and my friends\" response) or that what I want would be very difficult in this current day and age. They may also say that I'll feel a bit redundant as it will be difficult to find the skills required. In short, the responses that say I want to be a technician in the future are generally ones that feel that technical theatre is something that may only be suitable for an academic. This is not how I feel, as I'm happy in a more mainstream career path, where I've had the time to learn my instruments and learn my craft.\n\nThe answers to the question in the title \"How do I feel?\" that I asked of you in this particular exchange, were varied, but pretty much every single one came with some variation of \"I'm very interested on the technical side of it, but I want to work in the mainstream theatre/music/film world and I'm not so interested in technical theatre\". This is a fine line, and I can see why people have that reaction. I think this is why I'm a musician and not an artist; this feels much more to me like a career path and less like a place to study",
    "Relapsed yesterday 9/12/2014 and a friend of mine from highschool recommended the community. i've been on and off for a few years, and have become pretty addicted; been on one of those once a month since i turned 18. for the past couple of months i've finally decided to make a permanent commitment (to myself and to my sanity) to stop, and stop now. i'm pretty sure i'll never be able to quit. i've tried it before and i know that it's a waste of time. the relapse is a result of too many good intentions and too many good intentions not working. i've been there for a good while now i've known the true depth of addiction so i always tried to keep at least one good intention in mind; now i've realised just how much i'm wasting of other people's efforts trying to help me. for a while i did manage to stop and only used when i was out of my mind and there was no need. i am an addict, my mind can make me feel just fine, I'll be damned if i'll ever be so far gone that i'll go outside of that little box that has me hooked. i'm an alcoholic; i would never, never want to do that to my family and friends. i just don't want to. there are other options to keep you and your thoughts together. no one can make you stop (unless they want to, I'm not doing that) and they will only make you feel even more pathetic. i'll never get over this and I'll never, ever give in. It's going to be tough, but it's going to happen no matter what else you try. I've been doing this for over three years, and this is the last time. I'm going through hell anyway, but I know that the first part will have the most impact.\n\nThe full text of the post is below:\n\ni have been going through a pretty rough patch recently.. i thought i was done being clean. my first month I did no hard drugs and i wasnt having any problems for the first few months. like i said; i was pretty dependent. a few of my friends (who are friends of other friends) actually suggested i might be doing this for attention, etc. I got into the habit of hanging",
    "In addition to this, and my previous blog here, which also contains more data on NEO/Sachs-Baez numbers here. There doesn't seem to be any explanation anywhere about why any of these are different from their usual numbers for the last 10 years or so besides the comment at the very end - it's still puzzling to me as well that some of these things have been happening for a decade (the most recent one was not counted this year) whereas others took up to two decades before being noticed by mainstream media sources or publicizing to skeptics! It just seems to imply that something big is going on but perhaps this isn't necessarily something we need to worry about because there could easily occur in the following months or even years.",
    "It's been a while! I've finally gotten around to doing another release, and one with an entirely new game (Corsair Battlegrounds) in it as well! As usual I'll be using RetroArch build 0.7.9-r1142 for this release and all other versions. Since there were no significant changes between 0.7.9-j1 and 2 so far, we're going straight into the 2.0 branch now, which will eventually end up being the final stable development release. This means major new features from tomorrow onwards will not only go into 0.8 but the next minor release. The reason is because most of these things are currently under testing/dev builds. These include such big features as Steam support, OpenGL updates, and more... so until they become production quality the work on them may or may not occur while I'm in grad school (which is fairly typical lately), but some may happen anyway if people feel as though their hardware/software can handle them well enough and aren't having troubles working with retroarch yet. However once I get my degree and can afford to dedicate myself exclusively to this project, none of it would just cease to exist without me anymore :) Also in particular: If you're getting this message over bluetooth (i.e. via something like Gamepad Link, XBox360 controller emulator) you're probably missing my recent fix to that problem; and if your game doesn't start then try reinstalling SDL. That should hopefully fix all your problems. There are still about three hours left before I head off for finals and thus the rest of today's release won't be completely open-ended atm. So I'm gonna ask everyone if anyone feels like helping out a bit with coding to test games in advance of 1.2 releases, especially when it comes to the upcoming controller code. While SDL didn't receive any gameplay improvements nor does it even implement the new libretro input protocol I added, its documentation also got significantly better making things considerably easier overall (i.e., with less manual reading and digging). Once it gets to 1.2 however, this will essentially disappear as it needs even larger amounts of help for most basic gaming related tasks whereas these days there's usually pretty good tutorials available already :-) Anyway, to make sure everyone has decent coverage, all pull requests are welcome regardless of whether its new commits or",
    "In the last decade, the growth of the \"data mining\" industry has resulted in a large number of software packages and solutions that aim to automate the job of mining high-dimensional data and create reports.\n\nOne of the most popular and prominent are SPSS for Microsoft Excel and R for Unix/Linux. These are good candidates for anomaly detection in anomaly handling as they take advantage of machine learning to solve the problem. One of the reasons for using anomaly detection software was the huge amount of datasets being created. The availability of such data has given rise to many tools for the task, including SPSS and the more recent variant called SPMD. Here is a simplified example using this method:\n\nWhen we have an anomaly on a website we often know that it was created in a specific year. The problem is that we have never seen something like this, and probably never will. Most of the reports are produced on an annual period (yearly, quarterly, monthly, etc.). That is what makes use of anomaly detection so useful (we can expect more anomalies in the future!). However, what if, when the report is generated, we are interested in the period before that anomaly appeared? In such cases (if we can control the length of time in which the report will be generated), using machine learning to determine if this is a real situation or just one that was created later can be quite a useful tool.\n\nIn this post I want to illustrate how we can use anomaly detection to build a tool that can help us detect when anomalies appear in the data we have available. I will use data extracted from various commercial datasets to accomplish the task and use a real example of a business and its data to illustrate what I mean by \"a good light weight automatic\". In particular, I will focus on a model that was proposed by a group of researchers (S. F. Reis, P. Hahn). The paper called \"Machine Learning for anomaly detection and detection of anomaly-induced artifacts\" [pdf] has many good figures that might actually interest you. I will also try to illustrate one practical example of using machine learning to identify anomalies [pdf].\n\nOur problem\n\nThe scenario is simple: we have an inventory of products and we would like to show it as a picture on a desktop, so that customers can quickly identify the most recent order.

    "I'm not sure if this is an actual question, but I thought it was worth asking. The title says it all. Was Attila the Hun especially conservative?\n\nAttila the Hun was a very interesting figure in history. He's often considered to be one of the most successful generals in history and he had some pretty extreme views on how to rule his empire. For example, he believed that women should only have sex with their husbands or fathers (or brothers) and that they shouldn't even speak to other men unless they were related by blood. He also believed that the best way to conquer a country was to kill every single man, woman, child, and animal living there.\n\nHe did manage to take over much of Europe though, so maybe he wasn't as conservative as we think.",
    "I'm sick of having to write excuses for not taking medication. You want to know why? Because I'm sick of being told why I'm not taking it. After being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is different from the kind that affects more men than women (and has a slightly different type of cancer), I've made the point over and over that I cannot be expected to take the medicine they give me if I don't want to. I have the strength to carry life with dignity in spite of being sick. I love and accept myself just as the day I was born. I've made those statements many times, but have rarely felt the desire to say them. Recently, when I did, a man who I never met approached me at work (he was a friend of a friend who has been diagnosed with the disease) and told me, \"if I didn't take that medicine, I would be dead in a few weeks.\" I cannot stand by in silence as people say things which tell me that being sick is my fault, that I need to give in to them, that I am weak and should hide in the corner and allow things to happen for me.\n\nThe person who was asked to leave the meeting is the one who began this tirade with this statement:",
    "A few friends and I had just finished a long walk and started heading back into town, when this happened:\n\nThe guy gets right in front of her and says something along the lines of \"what's up girl?\" with his \"I told you\" face.

    "http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fjmvq/whats_up_with_people_thinking_their_shots_are_p...\n\nI know it's been a while since I've done a post that's had people talk about it, so bear with me! As you may have noticed, there have been a few threads in the LoL Off-Topic sub-Reddit that are about whether or not shots are actually supposed to go in. That's in response to a thread from the LoL General Discussion forum that was about the issue. The thread had people asking about the legitimacy and effectiveness of \"hook into a shot\" shots. I was particularly intrigued (and still am) by seeing someone who seems to own this style of shoving an item into the opponent's chest. There seems to be some belief that you have to go in first. What you don't see is where the shot comes from if you were to hit someone that wasn't expecting to be hit. It comes to them like a bomb and you have to get in their face. That's what I'm still trying to figure out though...\n\nFrom an early thread on Team Builder.com:\n\nhttp://www.teambuilder.com/discussion/1177/the-game-of-lee-pushing-with-your-hook-only\n\nThe answer I came up with was that they are all in line with each other. I also thought there was some question of whether or not you're supposed to hook into someone if they are being moved. I thought the way to think of this is the way we think of an arrow. If you're going to fire an arrow, you fire it with the point in the center. In the picture you see an arrow pointing in the distance toward the middle. You may think the arrow's not going to hit the target, but in this analogy, the arrow has already hit target at the edge of the circle... When a person's positioning is \"off\", then the arrow is supposed to be fired from its full power - with its full potential - and that point goes in (or comes in contact with, as it were). In other words, this isn't a new",
    "I dreamed that I was getting out of an elevator back into the living room, and there were candles and music blaring from the speakers. My boyfriend was there, too, though it could have been a combination of our two separate bedrooms. We got out of the elevator, and I noticed the lights were all off in the room. A strange foggy feeling lingered in the room, and I couldn't think straight. As I walked into the room, I was immediately greeted by what looked like a living room from a movie or TV show. I was confused, and started opening doors and cabinets as if they belonged there, but I quickly realized it was just a hallway and that the hallway was in my own bedroom. The curtains were drawn up tight, and I could hear music coming from above the speakers. After a series of closed doors and a few moments where I thought maybe the music was coming from somewhere else, I heard a voice say, \"Hey sweetie, you need to look in your drawer.\" I had no idea what the voice was talking about, but I opened my drawer and started digging around. I found an old photograph, but it was clearly of a man wearing a trench coat and trench boots. \"Hey,\" the voice said again, \"that's not a picture of your grandfather. No, he died in WWII.\" I started to get really scared, and pulled out my iPhone to take a picture for proof. The voice continued to say, \"Don't worry, we can bring him back to life. We can build him a shrine to his wife and children.\" I was shaking and felt my heart pound really fast, and the camera went crazy and started taking pictures randomly. The voice said, \"Wait. Don't take that. That's a photograph of your grandfather. He's very important to us. It would be disrespectful.\"\n\nRedditors have described the scene as surreal, and one redditor even claimed that \"I didn't know what to think, but I couldn't get it out that I just woke up from a nightmare,\" adding, \"And then my dad came home and I told him what happened, and he just said, 'I'm sorry you had a nightmare.' And he went back to sleep.\" Several others have since described their own similar dreams.\n\nA spokesman for the University Health Services tells the Washington Post that it is investigating",

She had a boyfriend, she liked me, she wanted to get married, etc. But then something changed.\n\nShe started acting more distant and distant. She stopped talking to me as often, and when she did, she didn't seem happy or excited. It wasn't until she told me she was pregnant that things really took off.\n\nAt this point, I knew something was wrong. I felt like I couldn't trust her anymore. I thought maybe she just needed time to figure out if she wanted to have kids. But then she said she wanted to keep the baby. And then she said she wanted to move back home with her parents.\n\nThis was all happening within a few months of meeting her. So I tried to explain to her that I loved her, but I also wanted to see where our relationship went.

    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've found it very helpful in my own life. It's a short list of things that you can do to make your life easier when you're trying to quit smoking. If you have any questions or comments about this, please feel free to leave them below.\n\n1) Don't smoke. This one is pretty self-explanatory. You don't need to be an expert on how to quit smoking, but just know that you will be much happier without it.\n\n2) Get up early. Smoking is bad for your health, so get up earlier than usual. The best time to start is around 7am.\n\n3) Eat breakfast. Breakfast is important because it gives you energy and helps you stay alert throughout the day.\n\n4) Drink water. Drinking lots of water helps keep your body hydrated.\n\n5) Take a walk. Walking is good exercise and helps you relax.\n\n6) Do something else. There are many other ways to help yourself quit smoking besides just smoking. For example, there are tons of websites out there that offer information on how to stop drinking alcohol, how to stop using drugs, etc.\n\n7) Try to find someone who smokes with you. If you live alone, try finding a friend who does too. If you live with others, try finding a roommate who doesn't smoke.\n\n8) Make friends with people who smoke. If you want to quit smoking, you'll probably have to deal with some people who won't like you for it. But at least they won't hate you.\n\n9) Find a support group. Many groups exist online where smokers can talk about their problems and share tips and tricks. Some of these groups are called \"smokers' forums\" and are run by ex-smokers themselves. They may even give you advice on how to quit smoking.\n\n10) Read books. Books are great for learning new things. Reading is also a great way to learn about different cultures and religions.\n\n11) Watch movies. Movies are great for learning about different cultures and religions.\n\n12) Listen to music. Music is great for learning about different cultures and religions.\n\n13) Talk to people. Talking to people is another great way to learn about different cultures and",
    "So here I am, sitting in my house, on a weekend evening after a really long day at work, and I've got a call from my girlfriend. The problem: she said she's worried I'm going to be cheating on her with that other guy we met at the party. She tells me:\n\n\"I'm sorry… we're together and I'm not sure if I can trust you right now, but I got this really bad feeling. I don't know how you feel about your relationship, but I'm not too sure. I feel so confused…\"\n\nI'm at the point where I feel sick to my stomach, to be honest.\n\nI don't want to believe that she's saying this.\n\nI know it's probably stupid of me, but I'm just not comfortable answering, in front of her, that I never did anything to her.\n\nShe tells me (she also sent me a text message, she says it's my job to say) that she thinks she's losing my trust again, but I don't really want to believe that I did anything wrong, because she told me that we'd love each other, all weekend, all of last week, etc.\n\nBut now I know… I know she did something… And she's just trying to justify it.\n\nSo she doesn't tell me what? No, because she's scared of getting me into more trouble. And she's right to be.\n\nI don't want to call her. I want to call her and explain myself, but instead of explaining it, she says, \"Well… you already know.\" She's not asking if she can help me, she's asking me not to reveal any secret information. So the only reason I call her is because I'm the kind of person who feels shame when I make a joke or act like I don't care about what I say, or I'm not interested. I still say I don't care, because I have the power to make her feel like I do, whether or not her feelings are 100% accurate.\n\nShe's also right when she says \"I don't know.\" I haven't been keeping track of my feelings about her. Because I don't want to know. I don't want to be guilty until proven innocent. This is not really something I'm comfortable admitting",

    "Oh, please don't take this as a defense for pedophilia or homosexuality– it's just pointing out that in some circles you can be openly gay and still have friends who are into young boys (like my older brother). The people that said this post was not enough to justify his expulsion were probably looking at other posts he made. If you are upset with him being expelled, then maybe do something like block his account– but we should all be really surprised if we find out later he's still hanging around. He seems more interested in promoting LGBT issues and making money, despite what his brother says. It's very disturbing to read comments on news sites about how they should 'keep homosexuals away' from their children.",
    "I've been playing around with some new character concepts for my upcoming game, and I thought it would be fun to share them here. The idea behind these characters is that they are all villains in their own right, but have one thing in common - they're all very shallow. They don't really do anything interesting or different, and they're not even particularly memorable. So what makes them so bad? Well, let's take a look at each of them individually...\n\nVILLAINS\n\nBaron Samedi (the Baron)\n\nSamedi is the main antagonist of the game. He's an evil wizard who has taken over the city of Krasnogorsk, and he wants to use its magical resources to create his own army of undead minions. His plan is simple: kill everyone in town, then turn the corpses into zombies. This is where things get interesting.\n\nFirst off, there's no way you can defeat him without using magic. You need to find a spellbook, which will allow you to cast spells. Once you do this, you'll notice that your enemies start turning into skeletons as well. That means that if you want to survive, you'll need to keep casting spells on them until they die. It's a bit like the old days when you had to fight against hordes of zombies before you could actually beat up the living dead.\n\nThis isn't the only problem with Samedi. He also has a weakness to fire, which means that you'll need to make sure you're constantly burning down buildings. If you burn down a building too many times, Samedi will become enraged and attack you. In order to avoid this, you'll need to stay out of range of his attacks while keeping your distance.\n\nIf you manage to defeat Samedi, you'll receive a quest reward. However, once you complete the quest, you won't be able to access the area again. Instead, you'll have to go through the entire level again, fighting the same enemies you did last time.\n\nKraven the Hunter\n\nKraven is another villainous character. He's a hunter who lives in the forest near the village of Vorkuta. Kraven is obsessed with finding the legendary sword known as the Dragonstone, which was said to grant immortality to whoever wielded it. Unfortunately, Kraven doesn",
    "I'm not sure if this is an actual quote, but it's what I was thinking when I saw that the new Star Wars movie had been released and I wanted to see it again. The first time I watched it, I thought it was great. It was a good story with some interesting characters. But then I rewatched it recently and realized how much I hated it. I don't know why. Maybe it's because I've seen so many other movies like this one before. Or maybe it's just because I hate myself for liking something so bad. Either way, I think I'll be watching the next one in a few years.\n\nThis is a very common sentiment among people who have never actually seen a Star Wars film. They love it, they want to watch it again, but they can't bring themselves to do it. This is understandable. After all, there are hundreds of films out there that you could choose to watch over and over again until you're sick of them. And yet, we still go back to them. Why? Because they're fun!

    "I'm not sure if this has been mentioned before, but I've noticed that some people are upset about Mastery unlocks being removed from the new game. The reason for this is because they were originally intended to be part of the progression system. They weren't supposed to be an end-game feature, and they certainly weren't meant to be a way to get better at the game. So why did they go away? Well, it's pretty simple really. We wanted to make the game more accessible to everyone. We didn't want players to feel like they had to spend hundreds of hours grinding out their characters just to unlock them. That would have made the game less fun for us as developers. Instead we decided to focus on making the game easier to play, so that anyone could jump right into the action. This means that you won't need to grind out your character to unlock all of its abilities. You'll still need to level up your skills, but you can do that later. And since we're focusing on accessibility, we don't plan on adding any additional content or features that require you to grind out your character. If you're interested in learning more about how we designed the new game, check out our blog post here.\n\nSo there you have it. It seems that the removal of Mastery unlocks was a result of the design team wanting to make the game more accessible to everyone. However, it also appears that the removal of these unlocks was done with the intention of making the game easier to play.",

    "I have been using this mesh system for about 2 weeks now and I am very happy with it. The only thing that I would like to see changed is the fact that there are two routers in my house, one inside the house and one outside. This way if someone were to break into my house they could not access my internet through the router outside. Also, I would like to be able to use the wireless network from the inside of my house but still have access to the internet from the outside. I know that this can be done by adding another router inside the house or by having an external router connected to the mesh. However, I do not want to add more hardware to my home because I don't want to deal with additional wiring. So what should I do?",
    "I have been reading about psychic phenomena for years now, but I am still not sure what exactly they are. I know that there are many different types of psychic experiences, but I don't really understand them all. I've read some books on the subject, but I'm still unsure if I get any real insight into my own experience. So, I thought I'd ask someone who has experienced this stuff first hand. I want to make sure I'm getting the right information here so I can better understand what's going on in my head when I see things like this.\n\nSo, I went ahead and sent an email to a friend of mine who claims to have had a lot of psychic experiences. He said he could help me out with this question. Here's his response:\n\nHi, I'm a psychics reader and I think I can answer your questions. First off, I'll say that I do believe that we are all capable of having psychic abilities. However, I also believe that most people are just not aware of their ability to receive psychic messages. This is because most people tend to focus on external events rather than focusing on themselves. When you're focused on yourself, you tend to ignore the fact that you may be able to communicate with other people through your mind. The reason why this happens is because you're trying to control everything around you. You try to control your emotions, your thoughts, your actions, etc. But, as soon as you start to notice that you might be able to communicate with others, you begin to realize that you can actually influence other people's minds. It's very easy to become distracted by external events and forget about yourself. That's why I always recommend that people practice self-hypnosis before attempting to contact another person. Self hypnosis helps you to focus on your inner feelings and thoughts instead of worrying about what other people think of you. Another thing that I suggest is to take a few minutes every day to write down your thoughts. Write down what you feel, what you think, and what you imagine. Then, after a while, you will begin to notice patterns in your thoughts. For example, if you were thinking about a certain topic, you might find yourself writing about it again",

    "Last month my ISP introduced two new measures to restrict access to certain websites for everyone else: P2P usage was restricted to 1Gb/s, and downloading was limited to 300KB/s (it's around this time that you'll notice some slow downs at high traffic times). I believe P2P limits are being rolled out globally now; apparently they're in place because of their connection performance issues on one big Internet Service Provider at an international airport. For all intents and purposes it seems like this has prevented many international travelers who use P2P with them having any fun at all - if you just want to browse the web or stream movies there is virtually no way it works right anymore. Also, for what I hear, there were reports yesterday of Verizon's own DSL peering partner throttling their users to up to 200Mbps on several popular Netflix content providers including Netflix.\n\n\nThis brought me back to thinking about how our wireless carrier is behaving these days...\n\n\nSo we took the advice of @zdaglar on HN and tried a small amount of P2P over T-Mobile WiFi this evening on WiMax with a laptop that wasn't connected to its WLAN. Nothing terribly interesting happened at first.\n\n\nThen, well within 10 minutes, my phone started lagging a lot. After 20 mins, I thought something might be wrong since my computer/laptop itself had been fine when I downloaded hundreds of megabytes of data before, it couldn't get much faster when it ran a browser. Then shortly after, my data throughput went borked. It never got better than 40 Mbps, every 15 min after 20 mins. Now I have to disconnect immediately as the device will not load at anything above 50 Mbps (the top available speed that is supported by Samsung Galaxy S4) - only down, so I will have to do away with a router altogether to avoid future problems. As far as I know, though, this should happen even without the latest software update; no such problem occurred earlier this week when the same method failed.\n\n\nI'd go ahead and delete any TMobile hotspot account info related to my phone that may remain connected via wifi. There aren't very many places near where I live that are offering the internet over that technology unfortunately, but still..... The device actually shuts down completely once I unplug it from tmo hots",

    "Why does Riot Games choose to use a skin as a promo for a game that will be released only in Japan?\n\n\"We don't know why Riot chooses to use any given skin,\" said Riot Games Community Manager Trion Worlds in an Ask Me Anything forum post on Thursday. \"We only know that when you buy one, the game and characters inside will be exclusive to Japan for the duration of the promotion, but we do not know why we choose to. We do not have many information to provide because we don't have one, but we are looking at all possibilities,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA post from the subreddit said that all of the skin for the new PBE skin are exclusive to Japan, because they were created and developed there, so it wouldn't be an accurate skin to use in other regions and would not be sold as a special skin through the store. An earlier post from a mod said they got multiple messages from people asking why these are exclusive to Japan, since they are not available via PBE or skins.\n\n\nThe first new skin that Riot Games releases in 2014 is the jungle champion Amumu, a concept skin that was first revealed at the 2013 Riot Game Developer Conference. At the launch of the 2014 season, other skins were introduced, such as the black and white skin of the \"World's Most Dangerous Man\" (previously known as the \"World's Most Dangerous Woman\") or the \"Lustrous Challenger\" skin of the blue mid laner, Shaco.\n\nYou can compare the skin, along with all the other skins in this skin sale, here.",

The first thing I found was a list of books by various people who have written about media studies. This seemed like a good start, so I started looking through them. But then I realized that most of these were written before the internet existed, or even before the advent of television. And while I can't say that I know everything about media studies, I feel like I could at least get a general idea of what they're talking about. So I thought I'd write down my thoughts here.\n\nFirst off, let me just say that I don't consider myself a scholar of media studies. I'm more of a fan than anything else. I love learning about new things, and I find that many of the best ways to learn are through the process of discovery. That being said, I am interested in media studies because I believe that it has a lot to offer us as individuals and as a society. I also believe that we need to be aware of the way our culture influences our understanding of the world around us, and that we should try to make informed decisions based on facts rather than opinions.\n\nSo with all that said, I'll give you a quick rundown of what I learned from each book listed above.\n\n1) Media Studies Is Not A Field Of Study\n\nThis one surprised me the most. I had always assumed that media studies was a field of study, and that it would eventually become one. However, when I looked into it, I discovered that it isn't. There aren't any formal programs or courses taught in media studies. Instead, there are several different types of classes offered throughout the year. Some of these include:\n\n• History of Media Studies (HMS) – This class focuses on the history of media and its impact on society. Students will examine the role of media in society, including the rise of mass communication, the development of print media, and the evolution of digital",

    "Hi, I'm a recent college graduate who just got hired at a startup in NYC. I've been working for them for two weeks now and have no idea how to handle this situation. My boss has been very nice but also extremely demanding. He's constantly asking me questions about my life, my family, my friends, etc., which makes it hard to focus on work. I feel like he's trying to get inside my head and see if there are any red flags that might indicate something is wrong with me or my personality. I'm not sure what else to do because I really want to be happy here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThis is an excellent question. It's one that many people face when they're first starting out in their careers. And while you may find yourself in a similar position, your circumstances aren't quite as dire as those described above. In fact, you could even say that you're lucky to be in such a good place right now.\n\nHere are some things to consider before you start worrying about whether or not you'll ever be able to make ends meet.\n\n1. You can always quit.\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed by all the demands being placed upon you, then quitting isn't going to solve anything. The only way to truly succeed in your career is to put in the time and effort necessary to learn everything you possibly can about your field. If you're willing to put in the time and effort, then you will eventually become successful.\n\n2. Your employer doesn't owe you anything.\n\nYour employer owes you nothing. They're not obligated to pay you more than they need to. They're not required to give you raises every year. They're not required to provide you with health insurance. They're not required to offer you benefits. They're not required to hire you. They're not required to promote you. They're not required to keep you on staff after you leave. They're not required to compensate you for any of these things.\n\n3. You should never take someone else's word over yours.\n\nYou shouldn't let anyone tell you that you're doing something wrong. You should always look into the source of information before making decisions. Don't believe anyone who tells you that you're doing something wrong unless you actually try it yourself.\n\n4. You",

    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've noticed that there are some people who seem to have an obsession with being obsessed over something. It's like they can't stop thinking about it and obsessing over it. They're constantly looking for ways to get more involved in it or to find out what it is they're so obsessed with. This seems to happen most often when someone is trying to figure out how to make money off of their passion. For example, I recently saw a guy on Reddit who was asking for advice on how to start his own business. He had no idea where to begin, so he asked for help. Someone replied saying that he should just go ahead and do it himself because he'd already done all the hard work. The guy responded by saying that he didn't want to do it alone, so he wanted to know how to get started. Another person said that he shouldn't bother because he would never succeed. So the guy kept going back and forth between these two points until finally he decided to give up. He then went on to say that he wasn't really interested in making money at first, but now that he knew how to do it, he felt like he could actually make a living doing it. That's when I realized that he was probably just obsessed with being obsessed over something.\n\nThis is a common problem among those who are new to entrepreneurship. They don't realize that they need to take action to become successful. If you're not taking action, you'll continue to feel stuck and frustrated. You won't see any results and you'll keep feeling like you're wasting your time.\n\nHere are some tips to help you overcome this problem:\n\n1) Don't try to solve everything yourself. Instead, focus on one thing at a time. Start small and build momentum.\n\n2) Focus on building relationships with other entrepreneurs. Find people who share similar interests and learn from them.\n\n3) Learn as much as possible about your industry. Read books, watch videos, attend conferences, etc.\n\n4) Be patient. Take things slow.\n\n5) Keep learning. There will always be something new to learn.\n\n6) Never give up!",
    "There I was, sitting at my desk with my head in my hands, a laptop in my lap, a glass of wine in my hand. I was having a good day. A perfect day. But then out of the blue, this asshole walks in, his face contorted in an unprintable expression. He walks like he's having a seizure. He moves in such a rapid and erratic, irrational way that I could not possibly anticipate when he'd just get out of his chair and walk directly at me, without pausing to take any breath between steps. It was not long before we were face-to-face, his eyes scanning my entire body for signs of movement or the slightest hint of hesitation, like, you know, a drug test for heroin in high school. He'd take a deep breath as if to say, \"Okay, I see you.\" And that's when my heart was going to shatter. My heart was going to go all fucking a-quivering and pop out of my chest and go splat over the fucking floor. He was so close, so close. He was so close. He was so close. I could hear his deep, rumbling breath over our shoulder in the kitchen— I just had time to think, \"You're so fucking close. Wait. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. He's so close!\" He comes around the corner, he stands right in front of me, his face screwed into the classic, white-necked-guy-smiles thing – and his eyes, like they hadn't seen a reflection for three fucking seconds, were so fucking wide, so fucking glassy, I mean, we were right in front of each other. I could see him smiling wide and holding his drink to his lips, which was more or less par for the course: there's a line of men, a line of red-faced, paunchy, hairy-chested dudes behind the bar right now, holding plastic cups and trying not to have people see them. You know what my favorite thing about the world is? It's that those red-faced men are fucking amazing at not being noticed, despite the fact that they have every right to be noticed. They seem to just exist in the room, invisible until something is done to them. It doesn't bother them",
    "So let me get this straight- The IWSTT aims to prevent you, and ultimately your clients or clients future (and potential) failures via low stress in terms of mental health.\n\nThis could be done by reducing stress at home and work/school/housing to allow for a more active life if your personal goals are in that regard. Or it could mean making sure other social areas where people can have time for themselves are avoided or minimized. You do what works for yourself and makes the most sense given your unique living. Do note there is no benefit to trying to change your environment so drastically as many companies do because unless they see results in 3 months, then the impact will be too small and not worth the effort. It will take a very special person dedicated to making changes and working toward the ends of these programs in order to make long term effects with minimal impact on their lives. That is simply asking you to sacrifice some well being. But as you have learned already with your IWT program – you don't get better until you stop doing things for yourself. So we say: go find something else that makes you healthy, happy, and successful!!! No one needs to watch other people in their life and act like them to get results. As far as our clients – we only know if they are accomplishing anything at all. If they aren't then what good are they after you spend millions of dollars? When someone thinks 'wow I didn't believe in myself' then no matter how much we might show them different methods- the message is still just the same. To put it another way…. if we were able to give you our 100 days of support that includes everything above then… what would you need next??? I wouldn't tell people to waste resources like going through something difficult just bc its expensive. Instead I'd offer them a more detailed plan on building up their life skills while keeping themselves busy and helping them achieve certain goals along the way. Letting them succeed or failing based on success in any endeavor allows them to keep moving on into a new chapter instead of stopping and saying 'well if you want to live an unhealthy, boring, high stress lifestyle now please be my guest'. There should be NO excuse for you to feel bad about anything anymore. Every day",
    "What if every hospital admitted ALL cancer patients? What if we cured many more fatal diseases with just a few percent of drug sales? How about curing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's before they even develop oncopathies/progression/disease progression? We could save millions of lives! Pharmaceutical companies would be able to sell more drugs because all profits go directly into research (as you guys have proven!) which in turn leads to new drugs that are cheaper per dose. Imagine people who don't need medication because their skin can heal itself. Can anyone see how great this would be?? I hope any one reading this will start an email chain asking other senators if they support this bill because it is simply phenomenal. Here is further proof and evidence of why we must do something to cure, mitigate prevent, treat Alzheimer's Disease; otherwise our country would fall apart. The link takes you to google search terms: Alzheimer's Disease Treatment Act; Cure ALS…etc. Please send this article to everyone at your local senatorial office! Thank You!!!",

    "Hello,\n\nAs you may or may not be aware, last Sunday, I wrote a post on my blog about the subject of sexual harassment (for anyone who's not familiar with it, it's not just about sexual harassment, although that is a part of it!).\n\nAfter seeing that post, an anonymous user decided to make an offensive joke about the sexual harassment, saying \"You're not going to believe what I did to this poor girl, but I left the post up on reddit for a long time because she was being such a slut who wouldn't shut up about it...\"\n\nWhat this joke didn't mention were the words \"slut\" or \"slut shaming.\" In case you didn't catch it, that's why the poster was banned from the site for the rest of the day. Other users were making fun of the poster for not being as \"tough\" as the poster, even calling them a slut when others made fun about that in the first place.\n\nI've read the first three pages of the comments here on this post, and I've seen many insulting comments about the poster. These aren't the first words that have come out of that user's mouth, and I'm pretty sure they aren't the last, either.\n\nThere's really two things to take from this, even if you aren't sexually harassed. First, don't let jokes like this one affect your decisions about what you post online or in real life. Second, it is the community's job to protect all its members, even people that make insensitive jokes.\n\nI hope that in the future, the community as a whole will learn a lesson where we aren't always okay with what other people say, and we will also continue to make sure the harassers in our community get the message that they are not welcome on this site or otherwise.",

    "When I hear people talking about their ADHD problems, it's almost all in relation to them having had a hard childhood. They're always saying how difficult they were growing up (at school even), and how much better their lives have been since they've started trying harder than before.\n\nI can sort of relate, but that doesn't mean that things are okay for me or my kids. Allowing others to experience life as adults without any difficulties just feels like going around in circles: we went through so many painful experiences when we weren't able to function correctly because of our disabilities, that some areas aren't really improved by our experiences anymore, after having gone through years of therapy work. It sounds simple enough, but I try not to make comparisons between myself and folks at the top and see if there might be an explanation in how things may go down.\n\nIn my case, I learned that certain kinds of experiences can set you back more than others, and sometimes it seems that I keep catching up too slowly. The most important thing here is to never forget that your ADD probably wasn't born today – instead, it was maybe five to 15 years ago, and you might get hurt every once in a while, like what took place to me in 2007-2008; however, this kind of thing should never last forever! This should stop happening within 10-20 years, and become something completely normal again for everyone involved, regardless on whether you live in a developing country or one rich Western countries.\n\nIf you do know someone who talks often about their ADHD-withdrawal symptoms, this thread will answer various questions you may ask when they're about to leave your family:\n\n\"Do you still drink? Does drinking affect where you work? Do you use alcohol to cope with stress? Will alcohol help you in school/society? Any other question you would like answered?\"\n\nThis might also happen while driving. Always check first with local laws regarding drinking while driving. Here are examples which differ from region to region:\n\nIn England, anyone found behind the wheel with less than 50 milliliters [µl] of blood[1] or 21.9 grams (½ ounce) of alcohol per 100 mL of breath are arrested. If the result isn't 100% sober, arrest has already happened unless: Someone fails to give their name or address If",
    "I'm not sure if this is an actual question, but I was wondering what it's like to get therapy. I've been seeing my therapist for about 2 years now and we have had some great conversations. She has helped me through a lot of things in life that I didn't know how to handle before. But she also has made me realize that there are so many different ways to be happy and healthy. And that sometimes you just need someone who can help you figure out which one works best for you. So here goes…\n\nIt's hard to describe exactly what it feels like to go to therapy. It's something that I don't really think about much anymore because I feel like I already know what it's like. I guess I would say that it's like going to church or meeting with your friends. You're all together and talking about stuff that matters to you. There's no judgment, no pressure, and everyone is open to hearing what you have to say. The only difference between therapy and church is that you aren't alone.\n\nBut I do remember feeling very isolated when I first started seeing her. I felt like I wasn't being heard by anyone else. I felt like I couldn't talk about anything that mattered to me without people judging me. I felt like I needed to keep everything inside and never let anyone see me cry. I still feel like that sometimes, but at least now I know that I am not alone.\n\nSo yeah, I guess I'll try to answer your question. Therapy is definitely like church. Everyone is there for you. You can share whatever you want and they will listen. They won't judge you, they won't make fun of you, and they won't tell you what to do. They just love you and care about you.\n\nAnd that's why I love therapy.",

I'm afraid they're going to kill each other. Any suggestions?\n\nThis is an excellent question. It's a good reminder that you should never try to control your pets' behavior by force. If you want to be able to protect yourself against aggression, you need to learn how to manage it. You'll find more information on this topic in Chapter 4 of my book, How To Manage Aggression In Your Pets.\n\nFirst, let's look at some basic facts about cats. Cats are social creatures who live in groups called colonies. A colony consists of several females and their offspring. Each female produces only one litter per year. This means that there are always at least three kittens born to each mother. When a new kitten arrives, its mother immediately begins caring for it. As soon as the kitten is old enough to eat, it starts eating from the mother's teat. After a few days, the kitten leaves the nest and goes off to explore its surroundings. At first, the kitten may wander around aimlessly, but eventually it settles down into a routine. For example, if it sees something interesting, it might follow the object back to its mother. Then, after a while, the kitten learns to stay close to its mother so that she can feed it. Eventually, the kitten becomes accustomed to being fed by its mother.\n\nCats are territorial animals. They defend their territory against intruders. Some cats will fight over food, toys, and other objects. Others will chase away intruders by biting or scratching. But most cats won't go out of their",

    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've seen it mentioned on other forums and in some articles that there are people who claim to be victims of sexual assault or rape who have faked their own rapes. This is something that happens quite often, especially with young women. They will say they were raped by someone they know, then later say they weren't raped at all. It's very common for them to lie about being raped because they don't want to get into trouble. The problem is that these stories can easily become true. If you're going to make up a story like this, you need to do so carefully. You should never tell anyone else what happened unless you absolutely have to. There are many reasons why you might fake your own rape. Maybe you didn't want to go to the police, maybe you wanted to keep the perpetrator from getting away with it, maybe you just wanted attention. Whatever the reason, you need to take care when telling others about your experience. Don't let anyone use your story as an excuse to avoid talking to the police. Also, don't ever tell anyone that you were raped. That's a huge red flag.\n\nThis is a great example of how we can all benefit from reading the comments section of any article. We can learn more about the person posting the comment than we would otherwise. And sometimes, we can even find out whether or not the person actually believes what he/she wrote.",
    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've had it up for a while now and thought I'd share it with you all. It's about how I feel when my boyfriend doesn't want to have sex anymore. He used to be so into me that he would do anything for me, even if it meant sleeping in his own bed or going out on dates with other girls. But lately, he just won't go down on me. We're both pretty much at our limits right now, and I don't know what to do. I really like him, and I think he likes me too, but I can't help feeling like something isn't right. Is there any way to fix this?\n\nThis is such an important question! If your partner is refusing to engage sexually because they are unhappy, then you need to figure out why. Are they depressed? Do they have low self-esteem? Have they lost interest in sex due to stress? These things happen to people who aren't happy, and sometimes they can be caused by depression. Sometimes they can also be caused by sexual dissatisfaction.\n\nIf you suspect that your partner may be suffering from some form of sexual dysfunction (or lack thereof), then you should seek professional help immediately. You might find that your partner needs to see a therapist as soon as possible. In fact, many therapists will refer their clients to a sex therapist. A good sex therapist will work closely with you to address any underlying issues that may be causing your partner to avoid sex.\n\nHere are some questions you should ask yourself before seeking help:\n\nDo you feel that your partner is avoiding sex because they are afraid of being rejected?\n\nAre you concerned that your partner is having trouble achieving orgasm?\n\nHave you noticed changes in your partner's behavior over time?\n\nIs your partner experiencing physical symptoms related to sexual frustration?\n\nDoes your partner seem to be avoiding intimacy more than usual?\n\nHas your partner ever expressed concern about their ability to achieve orgasm?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the possibility that your partner could be suffering from a mental health issue?\n\nHow does your relationship compare to others in your area?\n\nYou can read more about these topics here.",
    "Hello. My name is Robert. I had a pretty bad time of things. I mean really bad. I got raped last night. I felt sick that i was getting raped, but at the same time i needed it and the other dude said that he had nothing to do with it and that we should \"go home\". Well at the time i was kinda mad. But it happened and i had a really hard time thinking about it. Then i remembered I had someone who i could trust and talk to but i was too fucking scared to. The only thing i kept thinking \"that's never gonna happen to me\" and i felt really sad for that. Because it didn't and wasn't meant to.\n\nSo i went to my parents. You could say that this was the hardest part. Then I had a really hard time because it was late at night and my parents werent home, so i decided to get my clothes and get ready to go outside. But when i saw that they had gone to sleep i was like \"why won't my parents be there\". I ended up calling that fucking drunk asshole and he came that night and gave me some money and took me home. And i said \"thank you, i'm gonna go.\" Because i didn't know what to do. When i got to my door i opened it and it went to the other \"friend\" and they were just fucking talking and i was like \"please dont\" because i was scared. Finally i got this crazy idea that i should call the cops and take them in to have a talk. So i sat in my room and waited. Well i don't know really, i just started texting him to make sure he was okay and stuff. Eventually i could hear them walking back inside my house and i was so scared. I was afraid of what if they came right when they heard me yell. And the worse thought was that it somehow worked out, but my parents knew and got mad at me for being so drunk and just taking them in. I ended up making that call to police and told them everything. I then told the detective everything. He asked what i said. I could barely remember a thing. And he told me they were going to leave no problem. Then i was like \"you know what\" \"I'm gonna call my parents.\" Then something hit me. I was scared about",

    "Today, I read an email in The Guardian that went viral. In it, a young woman – who was once a 'highly-decorated student' and whom my own daughter had become friends with – said she felt 'like it has all been a lie'. She wanted to end her life: 'It's hard. I'm really depressed now'. Her parents later found out what she actually did (she took prescribed medication), so she has not yet ended up doing that… As some readers are likely aware, depression can go undiagnosed for long periods throughout one person's life, especially for someone such as this girl; but the first thing you need when a friend's suicide occurs is a strong dose of sympathy and compassion for the loss of someone who may have otherwise lived to a ripe old age. For those of you familiar with depression, you will know there is something deeply tragic about it, but it does serve as some sort of social glue; an impetus for support networks towards coping through difficult times… And you will also learn the folly of relying on a doctor for a diagnosis on your daughter's part, because she does not feel like she fits in with the stereotypical image of mental illness as psychotic episodes or severe personality changes. It seems clear that today, she feels much closer to being a normal teenager than an unhappy one. But despite this fact — and perhaps in spite of it — she felt she could no longer keep working a dead-end job at a public university anymore.\n\nNow, let me be very careful not to come across as sounding like an overly sympathetic mom while pointing this particular bone out – my son suffers in exactly the same way, probably more so as far as he understands – but if a parent told me their kid had decided to kill themselves over their 'unrealistic expectations', would I just chalk that up to normal teenage misadventures? Of course not! No matter how 'empathy stricken'?\n\nIf any of us were close enough to our teens to know all there was behind every adolescent behavior, wouldn't we treat them differently? Wouldn't we think they were being too arrogant for their own good, maybe narcissistic, even crazy? Isn't that what makes people want to do the things that have been attributed to them by society as the result of unfortunate childhood circumstances?\n\nAnd again on the subject – don't forget here that most adult diagnoses for depression are based",
    "(Note: it does not contain footnotes)\n\nThere are very few works that can be used to interpret the architectural remains, but a lot of work has been done, from examining the plans to piecing together what the details look like.\n\nTwo articles that are good for interpreting the fortification complexes are Anatolian Fortifications and Fortification Research Project.\n\nThe Anatolian Fortifications document is the best source we have for describing Anatolian Fortifications. It consists of drawings, plans, and descriptions of what is known of the ancient fortifications. The best part is the description of how everything was constructed with many details that have still not been explained.\n\nI think of Anatolian Fortifications as the best work as the descriptions that follow are more or less exact and consistent, in a way that you can learn from the way the ancient construction systems worked.\n\nIf you want to learn about how the Anatolian Fortifications were built, here is the article for that: Anatolian Fortifications\n\nThe Fortification Research Project does a kind of comparative study of other fortifications and some reconstructions of the fortifications. These structures have not been excavated yet, but they do have a lot of images that help draw out the kind of construction systems.\n\nHere is a description of the project from Wikipedia: Fortification Research Project\n\nThese descriptions are very helpful, but most of the information is not complete.\n\nA lot of the information is incomplete at this point. We understand the Fortification Research Project to be trying to fill in those gaps. They do a good job of making plans and drawing the fortification but that is a very narrow glimpse at the construction.\n\nSo some of the information that is available needs to be improved.\n\nThey are also using Wikipedia as a source of information, which can be a good way to get some information up to date, but there is much I do not understand in that source.\n\nIt has not been fully updated and it would be good to know how recent that information is that they have to draw from.\n\nAnd although I understand they are compiling information from a number of sources, there is much going on in the archaeological record that is still not well understood.\n\nHere",

    "Friends, family members and co workers who have been living with me for 6 years are probably shocked but I was the one that finally went through treatment to get rid of my anxiety. As long as you understand the way I am (anxious) when it comes to being around people and being social with them and how nervous I feel, then let's think outside the box here. My parents divorced because of problems in our home due to his constant nagging towards my mother from him going out with her girlfriends and his inability of finding employment/good paying job at another company that had no place for him, while he did not work after he got off the hospital so that left us both devastated seeing each other only 2-3 days a month even though dad was working during weekend and holidays. Not anymore. Now dad works two jobs and can afford to make time to be with and support me. I also found another job which is not stressful especially when I cannot go out alone or come home alone. He recently got in another fight about money and how she needs to start saving more funds in case she ever needs anything because of that fact that i do save enough for basic needs but some things like mortgage etc need more money which means more deductions and sometimes it takes quite a bit to cover these monthly expenses. So basically dad says to her that if anyone were to ask, why her savings is insufficient because mom isn't saving enough. Well, well, well. Lets just take this whole topic on it's own terms. At 25-30years old its very difficult keeping money aside for your kids and stuff like that... But since my depression and lack of social interaction in school was getting worse, I eventually found myself needing help for something bad, and found a therapist that told me to find my own self worth now before I leave this world.... She gave me a few suggestions that led me thinking over what my life would be like while trying to get better. For starters I stopped using all that nicotine due to my anxiety as well because now having the problem didn`t seem fair, especially given how much money I spend on cigarettes! This last year was the most frustrating thing that happened to me in 5 years of struggling with depression and other mental issues; I went from a normal college student that loved everything to just depressed and feeling worthless. Not knowing where else on earth to turn. However looking back over the course of those 5",
    "I'm an international student in my first year at university, and I've been struggling with this for quite some time now. I have no idea what to do about it. I don't know if I should just give up on studying abroad altogether or try something different. I feel like there's so much more that could be done to help me succeed here. I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nMy situation is pretty typical. I am a very bright person who has always had a great attitude towards life. I was accepted into a top-tier university (university of Toronto) after applying through a Canadian college. My grades were excellent, and I got straight A's in all my classes. I also managed to get into a good program of study, which included a lot of foreign language courses. I was excited to start my studies, but then things started to go wrong.\n\n1. The first semester went well. I made friends easily, and I felt comfortable around people. But then I realized that I wasn't really enjoying myself as much as I thought I would. I didn't enjoy being away from home, and I didn't enjoy having to deal with the stress of school. It seemed like everything was getting too serious for me. I wanted to relax, but I couldn't seem to find any time to do anything else.\n\n2. Then came the second semester. I still enjoyed myself, but I noticed that I was becoming increasingly depressed. I was spending way too much time alone, and I was feeling extremely lonely. I tried to talk to my professors about it, but they told me that I needed to focus on my studies. They said that I shouldn't worry because I'd be fine. That was frustrating, because I knew that I was doing something wrong.\n\n3. After that, I decided to take a break from studying abroad. I spent most of my time reading books instead of studying. I found that I actually liked it better than before. I even started to think that maybe I did want to stay in Canada. But then I started to notice that I was starting to lose interest in certain subjects. For example, I used to love math, but now I barely remember what I learned last semester. And I stopped caring about English literature. I guess I just lost interest in it.\n\n4. So I took another break. This",

    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've noticed that there are some people who seem to be using drugs more frequently than others. For example, I have seen several posts where someone says they're on methadone and then later say they're off it. It's like they're trying to hide their usage. Is this normal? Are these people just being paranoid or something?\n\nThis is an interesting question because it seems to suggest that people may be using drugs in order to avoid detection by law enforcement. However, it also raises questions about how much we really know about drug use among our fellow citizens.\n\nFirst, let's look at what we do know. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), between 2002 and 2012, the percentage of Americans aged 12 years old and older reporting past-year illicit drug use increased from 7.1 percent to 9.2 percent. The increase was greatest for marijuana users (from 3.8 percent to 5.3 percent).\n\nHowever, the NSDUH does not provide information on whether respondents were current users of any particular substance. In other words, it doesn't tell us whether respondents used drugs during the previous year. So, while the number of people who reported past-year use of marijuana rose over time, the number of people who said they had ever tried pot did not.\n\nIn addition, the survey does not ask respondents about their frequency of use. If you asked them how often they used marijuana, would they report that they smoked it every day, once a week, or less than once a month? We don't know.\n\nSo, when we talk about drug use, we're talking about two things: 1) how many people are currently using drugs, and 2) how often they use drugs.\n\nWhat about those who aren't currently using drugs? Do they still use drugs?\n\nAccording to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the most recent data available, approximately 8.5 million adults aged 18 and older reported having used illegal drugs in the past 30 days. Of those, 4.4 million reported using cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription pain relievers.\n\nOf course, these numbers are based on self-reports, so they can't prove anything.",

    "[Reddit]\n\nFear that my dysphoria will get worse as I get older\n\nI can't help it, but I want to quit being trans… (fear) I'm 27 years old; I haven't been out socially for several years; and I've got about 1 year left until my 2/3rds are complete. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Trans folk and society at large have become so hostile toward us that even trying to live our lives openly in a safe environment becomes incredibly difficult. I do what anybody else would do when they're faced with this kind of uncertainty: I seek validation; we all do. And that might mean feeling bad about myself if I don't feel worthy or good enough… I always make the point that I was born male and did everything right… my medical and gender history checks were spot on; and, since puberty, nobody's been able to find anything that makes me less cis … it sucks and I really wish nobody had any idea. What scares and confuses me most after coming out is discovering just how easy, low risk, and completely natural transition looks compared to the experience of just finding \"that one transsexual\". It also turns out the only reason people give for pretending they're transgender is because no matter how perfect their bodies are, they wouldn't be worth much without hormones, surgery and psychiatric treatment. There isn't room, or time, for a lot of internal conflict between who you know yourself to be and the part you pretend to be around society. For now at least, life is easier and more rewarding not caring about having a sex change. But, maybe as the years go by I'll have changed my mind; who knows? Either way, it doesn't seem worth it anymore. My friends are starting to wonder if they should consider transitioning, too; mostly me, since I'm still the youngest. People start asking questions like \"if [i]you could go back in time and change your natal sex again,\" so that's a pretty big turning point for some people – even though all those people are probably still alive and well once they're 65, anyway 😉 … I guess I haven't said as much yet because many other people's worries are bigger than mine, too.

    "I've been Comcast customer for 9 years now and have never once gone through customer service. I do know that customer services are a huge part of their business (with their competitor, Time Warner Cable). It's clear to me that they don't want this to happen again and I am extremely upset that I cannot get my money back until after this summer ends.\n\nHere is the text in its entirety (it's all capitalized even if it isn't):\n\nHey Reddit... My name is Jared Rea.\n\nMy husband was born here but he has some pretty major insurance policy problems that they have told him that if we file a complaint with our state or federal agencies that it may reduce what other work we can be reimbursed due to fraud in those policies, which is also my intention if I choose to sue them (this is my plan even though there is no reason yet because so far every insurance company that I've had an appeal with gave us zero dollars or a $500 discount).\n\nAnyway, in September 2009 we went through one of the worst times. They were shutting off lines on Thursday night which resulted in two of their workers calling me and offering me one bill for $15 which I assumed meant disconnection at 3PM on Friday. We called our local phone number and found out later that evening that they were still shutting people off until 11AM that day. This left me sitting there wondering why this happened on the weekend - since the lines hadn't shut down for four days! The next morning they switched things over but by then it was too late to try and get disconnected services waived but the fact remains that when they switch them over and you call for assistance they won't honor your request unless it falls into the time frame mentioned above. After about 5 hours on Friday afternoon I finally decided enough is enough and called back and got some kind of voicemail that said someone needed to tell me how many reps were working, and I tried to hear the recording but the line would go dead with only the words \"Your call is being recorded.\"\n\nSince I didn't buy any cable service online during that entire week I just assumed I wasn't getting billed. Apparently some type of glitch caused them to send out payments early, including this month's bills. When we received the new bills on December 14th we realized they didn't show this particular account as connected without making",
    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but it's something that I've noticed about myself since I started eating healthy. It's like my body doesn't know what to do with itself anymore. My stomach feels empty all the time, and I feel like I have no energy at all. I don't even want to go out in public because I can barely stand up straight. I just sit there and stare into space for hours on end. I think I might be having anorexia or bulimia. I'm so scared right now. I'm going to try to get help as soon as possible.\n\nThis is such a common problem among people who are trying to lose weight. They're afraid they'll never be able to eat again, and they're terrified that their bodies will reject them completely. But here's the thing: Your body isn't rejecting you. You're rejecting your own self-esteem.\n\nYour body is telling you that you're fat. And it's telling you that you're ugly. And it's telling you that you're worthless.\n\nYou're not worthless. You're beautiful.\n\nAnd when you stop believing that, you start to believe that you are worth more than that.\n\nSo how do we fix this? How do we make our bodies accept us for who we really are instead of judging us based on what society tells us we should look like?\n\nWell, first off, let me tell you why you shouldn't judge yourself based on what other people say you should look like.\n\nBecause everyone is different. Everyone has different tastes, different preferences, different personalities. Some people love chocolate cake; some people hate it. Some people like to wear high heels; others prefer flats. Some people like to eat ice cream every day; others only eat it once a week.\n\nEveryone has different needs.\n\nBut one thing that everyone does have in common is that they're human beings. We all deserve respect.\n\nWe all deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.\n\nThat means that we need to treat ourselves with kindness and compassion.\n\nIt also means that we need to learn to love ourselves unconditionally.\n\nIf we don't, then we won't be able to love anyone else.\n\nWhen we love ourselves, we become stronger. When we love someone else",
    "I have an 8 month old puppy that has been in my home for about 2 years now and he's always had some sort of aggression problem, but this year it seems like he's gotten worse. He's constantly trying to get at me or bite me, even though I'm wearing a harness. It started out as just a few bites here and there, but then it escalated into him biting me on more than one occasion. The first time was when we were walking around the house together and he tried to jump up onto my lap and try to bite me. I pulled away from him and he backed off. Then he tried again and jumped back up onto my lap and bit me on the leg. This time I didn't pull away and he backed off. After that, he would only bite if I wasn't paying attention to him. But every time he did, I'd be reminded by the pain in my leg. So I decided to take him to the vet because I knew something was wrong with him. They gave him a blood test and found out that he had kidney stones. I've never heard of anything like that before so I called the local shelter and they said that they couldn't do much since he was still young and healthy. I took him home and waited until he got bigger and stronger. When he finally came home, I put him in his crate and left him alone for a couple hours. About 30 minutes later, he went outside and sat down next to me. As soon as he saw me, he immediately lunged forward and tried to bite me. I quickly grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and held him there while he struggled against me. He eventually let go and ran over to where his mom was sitting. She picked him up and carried him inside. I don't know what happened after that, but I think she thought he was sick or hurt. I haven't seen him since. I feel really bad for not being able to protect myself from him. What can I do to prevent this from happening again?\n\nThis is a very common question, and the answer is simple: NEVER LEAVE YOUR PUPPY IN A CHAIR!\n\nIf you're going to leave your dog in a chair, make sure it's a sturdy one.

    "This came to me from a conversation with friends of mine, the topic was \"mad gothic women who are mad gothic.\" I had an epiphany during that conversation.\n\nMy mind went to some images I had, it was a woman in a suit, it had gothic elements to it. I thought of the Archon, the female entity at the edge of the world known as the Mad Goddess. She is a being formed by madness, one who sees the past, present and future and can conjure up terrible things from it. It was a vision of what this Mad Goddess might look like. My friend suggested the Mad Goddess might look similar to a demonic creature.\n\nI said \"I can make one!\" and I started making one a few days later. I was able to visualize a large spider in a suit of armor, armed, vicious and trying to capture one of the party members. I think this was a fun thing to do, drawing inspiration from a world I am so familiar with. The images were inspired by the images of a woman using a bladed claw to pull a man into a pit of spikes.\n\nThis is a quick summary and a little story. The characters are one female, from a village that has been overrun by a monstrous creature, the party is searching for them. She's a simple person wearing armor and a suit of armor, with a giant spider on her back. It's a little vague and I'm sure this is being worked on during our weekly game, but it would be nice to create the Mad Goddess as a more fully fleshed out monster.\n\nI'd love to hear your ideas and critiques, what do you think of this idea? How do you build an image? Feel free to put them in the comments.\n\nThe final image, by our awesome artist. She made this wonderful character!",
    "\"As I have posted before Nimue had been out for weeks. She had to come back in because it is really important that she does not get bitten by a bear or something like that. But once all of the other kids are done at home Nimue and I headed out to Nimue went to our yard to do some digging. We came across a burrow. Our dad was sitting in the dirt, and he was looking over at us. \"I'm just going to take a good look at it\" he said, he walked back to the burrow and proceeded to climb down the mound and poke his finger up in the ground (he's not big or strong). His finger went up and his arm flapped up, the mound shot back at him and he fell down flat on his face.\nAnd so began the long healing process. He also had another procedure for getting his back shaved, (this did not heal well) so he had to have all sorts of procedures for his back and legs to try to make them be better. That is why he has had so many surgeries. We still miss him now. We love him and we are going to miss him really badly. This whole summer has been tough for us.\"\nNow, I believe you're correct there. I was just as disappointed and concerned for Nimue when, in a heartbreaking twist, she never appeared again on the mountain that she lived out of during the last season of \"Pretty Little Liars.\"\nMy brother and I had heard rumors that she was going to die, but until we heard it directly from the liars about their plan to kill her, I don't recall ever hearing people tell me that \"they have found a new grave for her.\" I only saw her in a flashback where another person took her to see a doctor. I did not see her for an extended period of time. \nSo, my brother and I and another member of our family were not told exactly what was going on when we started digging up the mausoleum that was at least 7' x 10' where she had been buried. We dug for about a month and found only a small piece of rock with a hole in it (which can easily have come from someone trying to break in). So, we took it home and it's since been turned into a miniature replica of the grave.\nNow",

As far as I'm concerned if I never hear any other song then this one will be my favourite.\" I guess you get what I'm saying right? So no way to deny this shitty music without having been influenced by a whole lot of slop; like maybe this quote will cause you to check out the band I mentioned earlier… but in the mean time listen to the most skunky black metal of those who really deserve to be considered shitpissers… but didn't become so because people ignored their own standards. So in the end everyone must come back to who they already believe to be decent musicians. And yes, Skrewdriver is in this list.\n\nI will give him credit; he probably hasn't heard anything else worth listening too. But when someone claims that Skrewdriver was never any good, I have to wonder why they started hearing anything in the first place! Are metalheads more accepting towards subpar bands now than they were ten years ago?! They should actually read the reviews on websites like metallifeat.net and learn how to appreciate greatness instead of making up stuff about a band. I hope they do a bit better review than I did, at least some sort of appreciation and intelligent criticism would help these types of people see the light. These kids need real motivation, not just \"get off my lawn I hate it\". The rest of you readers; what was your favorite Scandinavian Metal band 10 years ago?

    "I'm confused about whether to call myself Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, etc. I've been trying to figure out what my religious identity is for years now and have come up with a few different answers that are all pretty vague. I don't know if it's because I was raised in an environment where religion wasn't really discussed much (my parents were both atheists), but I feel like there's something missing when people ask me these questions. I guess I just want to be able to say that I am who I am without having to explain why.\n\nSo, I thought I'd try to answer some of your questions here.\n\n1) What does being Jewish mean?\n\nIt means you believe in one God, and that God created the world and everything in it. It also means you believe in the Ten Commandments, which are written on stone tablets in Israel. You may not agree with them, but they're still part of Judaism.\n\n2) How do Jews define themselves?\n\nJews define themselves by their faith, and by how they live their lives. They look at the world through this lens, and they see themselves as living in a time of great change. The Torah tells us that we will experience many changes over the course of our lifetimes, and that we must prepare ourselves for each of those changes. We are told that we should seek knowledge, wisdom, and understanding of the world around us. This includes learning about other religions, cultures, and traditions.\n\n3) Do Jews believe in reincarnation?\n\nYes. In fact, most Jews believe in reincarnation. Some Jews believe that the soul goes back and forth between life and death, while others believe that the soul remains in the body until it dies. There are even some who believe that the soul never leaves the body.\n\n4) Are Jews allowed to marry non-Jews?\n\nNo. While Jews are permitted to marry outside of their own faith, they cannot marry someone of another faith. If you are married to a Jew, you are considered Jewish. However, if you are married to someone of another faith, you are considered Jewish only if you convert to that faith.\n\n5) Is it okay to wear a kippah?\n\nYes. Many Jews choose to wear a kippah, or skullcap,",

    "As many of you know, I have hemorrhoids. They are painful but not debilitating. When I started going through my teenage years they developed into a mild to moderate infection. My doctor told me that they would subside in time, but I didn't understand how that was possible when the condition had no medical explanation other than that it might just be a side effect of growing up skinny and being constantly on my feet for most of my life. Well, it did subside… for about three years and then started up again as new growth appeared. It appears that the initial infection was caused by a virus called HPV [human papilloma virus] and it seems that if I skip a HPV vaccination every 10 years, my HSV-1 will be cleared up.This week, I became aware that I have an infection on my right armpit and my doctor is recommending I remove it. A biopsy will take place, but no one mentioned the potential damage to my armpit in any of the discussion pages/discussions. I would also like to hear more informed opinions from you guys regarding this issue. What is an accurate and specific diagnosis for my condition, and when should my armpit be removed? Does having a small armpit bother me at all? Does it keep me from sleeping? Are there other options that I am choosing to pursue without doing anything that might be a detriment to myself and my health?I would also like to thank u/knightanddruid for the help she gave me in looking into my symptoms and seeing what she believed to be the cause for the armpit problem.

    "I'm not sure if this is an actual monster or just some kind of weird, mutated animal. I've seen it before in my neighborhood and have never been able to find any information about it. It's always around the same area, but it seems to be moving at different speeds. The only thing I can think of is that it could be a giant spider. I don't know how big it is, but it looks like it could be as large as a house. I've heard stories of people seeing these things for years, but they're usually described as being huge spiders with legs that are longer than their bodies. This one doesn't seem to have any legs. It also doesn't seem to move very fast. It moves slowly, almost like it's walking on its belly. I've tried calling the police several times, but no one ever answers. I've even called the local fire department, but they said they couldn't help me because there was nothing out here. I've looked online and found many pictures of them, but none of them look anything like this. They all seem to be much smaller. Any ideas?\n\nThis is a great example of what happens when you try to describe something without actually looking at it. You end up describing something that isn't really there.\n\nHere's another example:\n\nI saw this creature while driving home from work last night. It was sitting on top of a tree near my house. It had two eyes, a mouth, and a long neck. It seemed to be trying to get into my car. I drove away quickly, but then it jumped off the tree and ran across the road. I didn't see it again until today. I live right next door to where it was. I've never seen anything like it before. Is it dangerous?\n\nThat's a good question. If you were to ask someone who lives nearby whether they'd seen a giant spider, would they say yes? Probably not. But if you asked them if they'd seen a giant spider that moved slowly, wouldn't they say yes? Of course! That's exactly what happened here.\n\nSo why did he call the police? Because he thought it might be a giant spider. He wasn't going to let it go.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Here's another picture of the creature:\n\nAnd here's",

She had people talking for years! Then she went off on something else and everyone forgot how to talk back to her again. Well, it wasn't me. I saw an opportunity here. There were some pretty cool benefits to being introverted, including: you can fit several things into your day with less energy than other types, especially when it comes to work (a few minutes a week can be very helpful), you're highly likely not to have too much conflict without becoming overwhelmed or needy, your relationships are more stable if you don't feel overbearing, you generally aren't as easily startled into irrational reactions–even at strangers or other negative situations, which means you rarely get the urge to run away from what's happening–and also if you need help, you often know exactly who to ask. You already recognize yourself before others do by virtue of learning early on that there's no reason to pay attention to another person until they've actually gotten close enough to read my face, though sometimes their comments can give readers chills. And that last point sounds eerily accurate in light of this. If only there was someone…\n\nI agree; she did a great job. Read full post – I'm sure she'll enjoy our follow-up discussion!",
    "Forgive me for this, but I'm afraid it's just too late—I have too much data and experience with these things for my ego or other excuses to get out of writing about our childhood thoughts on jerks that we tried jerks growing up. So here goes... On two separate occasions a year apart, both in junior high school, there would be five students sitting together in class. The teacher would approach and address each one directly, giving a brief introduction, before asking their name; what grade they were in, if any, gender, etc., then ask again at which table they sat (usually two tables), with either no response by way of answer or with an initial 'well-dressed' response indicating either that they had not received the first question, or otherwise simply was unable to give such a detailed description as the teachers requested. For example, one male student was wearing his jacket over his shirt top. When asked which he thought was a button collar and which wasn't; this happened when he'd gone through some changes. One girl actually said they were both buttons but her classmate's had buttons hanging down instead of buttons going on the waistline, suggesting she took some different course. We were told several times during our freshman year by teachers that students must wear the appropriate shirts in order to pass/finish their classes if not already done so/or else will receive a report grade for being late/not dress appropriately for today's lesson(s). This would continue even into Senior High School. Each time after graduating, we heard that the next student was going to try to come back and talk to us to show us how hard they've been working since before we got home, and would apologize profusely afterwards. It just goes to show that all too often kids are doing very bad at life because their self-image isn't working, and that's okay. But the truth is nobody wants to think like an asshole most of the time and having been warned numerous times this behavior cannot be tolerated in any sort of social setting. And anyway, we didn't do anything wrong; that teacher was really only trying to protect herself. It takes a certain amount of self assurance to go outside of your own comfort zone and try something new or take personal and vulnerable risks within that context for the consequences to be understood and accepted. In fact, my experiences as a socially awkward kid lead up",
    "What happened? My partner and I started sleeping in separate rooms two weeks ago, with mutual consent (we aren't exactly kinky or dominant, but we are both pretty comfortable around sex). Now I don't know of many partners who can honestly say they've been more open in having multiple lovers; especially with someone as well-adjusted as me, whose tolerance for kinkiness has always been on par with her ability to cope, much less enjoy it…. The fact that I have had an experience like this is one of my greatest triumphs in life. It feels fantastic and liberating at once; yet deeply sad. But even as something so bittersweet, it also means that other people's struggles must mean something…. At the very least, other Poly families are validating what I've felt since about myself…. We went out last night, all three hours. When she came down some friends were there waiting for us, apparently with good news about our future, and another one showed up later… The first time I knew exactly why we did this was the following morning when I woke up, feeling refreshed and joyful after four nights without sleep because I'd slept through everyone else's drama…. There really shouldn't be too many words attached to anything; it will make sense eventually… I have had moments of panic recently. Fearful thinking about how things would go if something serious happened to my loved ones. This fear could manifest itself for various reasons (e.g.: What do I feed / take care of them/ pay our mortgages / whatever?) And yes, this seems to include feelings of physical vulnerability….. However, after reading some comments I came across online stating how their relationship with the person who left meant the loss of a spouse is never easy…. So today before the day starts off, the thing that stands in the way is being in a loving, supportive environment filled by people who will listen to what's coming out of your mouth and give you space if this worries you. For example: My concern about things going wrong might sound stupid and whiny if I wasn't actually worried about having to handle finances. And yes, my need for my own house and free rent probably does sound annoying.\n\nAnd now here's what he received back:",
    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I was recently on an international flight and had to take off my shoes at the gate because they were too big for the size chart. The airline's policy is that you can't wear your shoes in the terminal unless it's a special occasion (like a wedding). So I took them off and put them into my bag. When I got to the gate, I asked the agent what would happen if I didn't have my shoes with me? She said she'd call security and get someone to come pick up my shoes. I told her I wasn't going to leave without them. She then called security and they came out and picked up my shoes. They gave me a receipt saying that they were returned to me. I don't know how long it took for them to return them or where they are now. But I do know that I will never fly again until this happens to me again.\n\nThis happened last week, so I've seen similar stories elsewhere. It seems like there's no way to avoid this problem.",
    "To anyone who might take seriously my claim that modern Western liberals are \"trying to erase human nature,\" I'd be grateful for clarifying this statement or dispelling any misunderstandings about what it means, or that I would have something new to add by the time this column goes to press:\n\nYou can't remove humanity from modern liberal thought unless it gives you pause. It's difficult even in this country if not impossible, where an honest examination of our current situation has traditionally been taboo due largely to the role liberalism played in the foundation and continuation of our flawed society over the past several decades. But that was then, this is now. We as people should remember how things truly were back when we still had reason. Here are some key facts I feel would be in order on just such a subject: When Hitler came to power in 1933, there were no gays to denounce in his Germany, there were only four million Jews left in Europe to be gassed on sight; there were no Jews at all to be hated or killed; and there were less than 5,000 homosexuals in Germany (compared against an estimated 50 millions homosexuals across the world). To say it differently, homosexuality existed only outside of Nazi Germany. Even after Hitler got rid of Hitler—and, more important, went on killing thousands of millions during WWII—the number of those who survived to speak out has never gone low enough - despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of these men took their own lives after the Holocaust. In other words, people simply did NOT try and annihilate homosexuals. They didn't kill them because they said so or tried to get rid of them. What they did was the same way Germans and Asians treated their fellow Americans and Japanese after WW2 but when confronted with the horror of the holocaust, tried to make a buck. Why? The simple explanation is that they could do nothing else under those conditions nor would they give up anything they knew to be necessary. Homosexuals did NOT go around wanting to murder homosexuals (as a result of which the KKK murdered dozens in the 1950s, 1940s, 1840s, etc.) And certainly homosexuals didn't seek to suppress any right on moral grounds. In short, the same thing happened in both Hitler's Germany and Japan. People simply sought to make money until doing so was morally reprehensible while accepting such atrocities happened to",

As of November 7, 2012, if you have never been an active redditor, you will be automatically created as a new Smurf on your account and given the opportunity to create your own subreddits. To help facilitate the creation of additional free communities on Reddit-we are going to give away 250 redditor keys as our way of saying THANK YOU! The idea behind the giveaway was inspired by the subreddit [r/SmashBros](http://www.reddit.com/r/SmashBros). We know there were a lot of great Smash Bros fans that wanted to participate in creating more friendly communities around their favorite videos game characters. If we can reach 500 redditors through these giveaways before the end of December, then we will donate all the remaining redditgifts funds directly to r/SmashBros instead of splitting them and passing them onto other charities like http://reddumproject.org/.

    "I'm currently working on my master's degree and I have about $30,000 in loans. My question is this: How much extra buffer should I be taking? I know that if I take out more than $10k in loans, it will affect my credit score negatively. But how much extra buffer should I be taking? Is there any way to calculate this for me? Thanks!\n\nThis is an interesting question because it touches upon two issues that are often discussed when discussing student debt: the impact of student debt on one's credit score and the effect of student debt on one's ability to pay back their loans.\n\nFirst, let's look at the impact of student debt on one's credit score. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has published several studies on this topic, including one by the Federal Reserve Board itself (PDF). In its most recent study, the Fed found that the average borrower with federal student loans had a FICO score of 621, which means they were considered \"high risk.\" This score was based on information collected from borrowers between 2007 and 2010.\n\nIn contrast, the average borrower without student loans had a FICO score of 585, meaning they were considered \"low risk.\" That same study also noted that the average borrower with private student loans had a FICO score of 740, while those with public loans had a FICO score of 825.\n\nSo what does all this mean? It means that if you're borrowing money to go to college, you need to make sure that you don't end up owing too much money on your student loans. If you do, then you could find yourself having trouble getting approved for a mortgage or car loan, as well as being denied for a job.\n\nBut what about the effect of student debt on one's ability to repay their loans? Well, according to the Federal Reserve, the average borrower who took out federal student loans owed $20,856 in interest payments per month. So if you borrowed $50,000 over four years, you would owe $1,500 per month in interest payments.\n\nIf you wanted to borrow less than $5,000 per year, you'd only have to pay $200 per month in interest payments. However, if you wanted to borrow more than $5,000 per year, you'd have to pay $2,400",

    "\"At 1:45 in the morning, a group of people were outside of a restaurant I'm visiting (I usually only eat at restaurants with multiple outlets). When I pulled into the lot I saw the guy I was talking to come down the block in his car. I opened the door, but he walked in without my consent. At 1:48 in the morning. This was the second time this has happened. I asked him at least 2/3 times to give me a ride the first time, but that didn't work. It still did not work, so I pushed my car against the curb on the pedestrian side and walked down the street for approximately another one-and-a-half blocks with the rest of the group. The guy came down again when the rest of my group left and started following our vehicles. The second time he came down, I had opened my car door and stepped into the car, but he still didn't give up. I had opened the driver's door instead and stepped in. He kept asking me why I would do something like this to him, why I left a person's car door open. On the third attempt, I went all the way to the front door and he let me take ownership of my car. He got behind the wheel of my car and told me to step out through the driver's side door but I was in the passenger seat and went around his back, pushing him out through the passenger side door and onto the sidewalk when he came back inside in the car. He was extremely nervous, but I explained why I did it and left him alone. When I got to my destination, I had left the keys in the front seat and told him he had to drive myself to work the next morning. The guy got angry and said I had no right to pull him out of my car and take it. He insisted on arguing with me the whole way home. It took about 45 minutes to get to work after this happened. What is my obligation as a customer, to get food from a restaurant? How much do I owe this guy in compensation for his discomfort?\"\n\nThe commenter also says that she was threatened with legal action and told, \"You will be sued by the establishment because you have violated their privacy.\" According to the original post, a local restaurant called Waffle Bistro is where the incident occurred.",
    "I had my rMA (replacement) card for a little over 7 months. Here are my findings...\n\nRMA's have become more and more common now. For the last 3+ years my card has been used almost daily for graphics/gaming. At first I considered it to be a great and quiet card. And after using it and doing some benchmarks I would agree with that. Even compared against my GTX 560 it performs pretty closely. After a few days I noticed something strange. My PC would get really hot or at least I assumed so. I had to run a fan to cool the whole system. Then my card started losing battery life. I checked the back of my card and the fans (which seem to be very similar to the CPU fans in your CPU) were being kept at 60-70% and even when i left the system on, they were only running about 20% with the GPU loaded. Now, i had another card that had about 6 months of use with it and it never had a problem.\n\nAfter going online and doing some research I found that rma's were becoming a common issue. I tried to tell all of us here at GTR that GPUs were unstable and that it might be best to keep them in stock for such things. It is understandable then that you would want to purchase a new card that can handle the task. And that is indeed what people do...until it doesn't. Well, it can work out, but it did not...until this issue occurred.\n\nUpon replacing the card it began to perform much better and lasted for about 2 weeks. Then the voltage dropped again. It was around 30 - 41volts. Then I noticed that it had increased my RAM as well as my USB speeds while it was on. The fans would not run at full speed when the card was off. I eventually had to turn the fans off to shut the system down. It then came to me. I knew that I didn't have the power cord on for that to work (or ever) and that was an additional issue. However, the memory was completely stable and even improved when it was off. I had no issue with either of these issues after having it on most of the time. And even at high temperatures, the memory would have been able to maintain at least 90% of its original performance. I thought that was odd",
    "We have all heard it: If we all act responsibly, \"there will be no human disaster of historic proportions.\" And I was hoping that this might not come true; after all, humans are responsible for some of the most amazing things in history: the pyramids and Renaissance architecture in Egypt; the invention of transportation by steam-powered engines; scientific discoveries (e.g., relativity); industrial improvements in agriculture (and more recently, nuclear power for power generation as well). So what about global warming? I can't help but feel that something's wrong here. In 2012, NASA reported an annual average temperature increase of 0.26°C from 1880 to 2008, with 1998 coming out on top at 1.73 degrees C (which means that 1998 would equal 1990 this year if they were kept constant), just slightly higher than the previous record high temperature recorded in 1951. On May 1, 2013, scientists with the U.S. National Academy of Sciences published a paper questioning the validity of the IPCC assessment report. The author of their study wrote: \"To our knowledge, no comprehensive analysis has ever been performed on past changes in mid-latitude temperatures.\" The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration stated in 2010 data only \"indicated slight increases during the last several decades, although there was significant regional variability observed around both poles,\" so we shouldn't expect massive ocean-atmosphere warming either. While the United States may experience increased precipitation, rising sea levels, worsening drought and extreme weather such as droughts, heat waves or hurricanes increasing may not be occurring. Moreover, contrary to popular belief, it seems to me that it isn't exactly 'eco' to use fossil fuels because the primary goal seems to be to feed your children. No surprise then that scientists across the board are now pointing these same issues over into other societal areas including health in general, and mental illnesses generally. As more evidence accumulates, however, many people are being more vocal against environmentalism on other social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. It should also perhaps be noted that we're starting to see governments take action on this growing trend. For instance New York City passed a motion in April 2014 that requires businesses based in the city to disclose the greenhouse gas emissions from their operations and products by Oct. 15.",

    "I've been playing Destiny since launch, and I have to say that matchmaking has been pretty bad for me so far. It's not just that it takes forever to find matches (which is annoying), but also that there are no real rewards for doing well in them. The only thing you get when you win is XP, which isn't enough to level up your character or gear. So if you're like me and you want to play with people who are better than you, you can't do that unless you go on a raid or something. And even then, you'll probably be matched against someone who is worse than you. This is especially frustrating because I'm trying to play with friends, and we all know each other really well. We don't need to be matched against random strangers either. If Bungie wants to make sure everyone gets into the game, they should at least give us some sort of incentive to play together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an issue that has plagued Destiny since its release. In fact, this was one of the main reasons why Bungie decided to delay the game until September 2014. But now that the game is out, it seems like Bungie is finally taking steps to fix the problem. Last week, Bungie announced that it would be adding new ways for players to earn loot, including a weekly quest system.

I know how hard it is to leave a community you love, especially one where you've spent years building up your reputation. But I think we need to take a step back and look at what's really important right now. The moderators of r/politics have been working very hard over the past few months to make sure that our subreddit is a safe space for everyone. We've made changes to our rules, removed content that violates them, and generally tried to keep the tone of discussion positive and civil. That said, we still have a lot of work ahead of us if we want to maintain that status quo. So let's talk about what needs to happen next. First off, we need to figure out how to better communicate with each other. There are many different ways to communicate with the mods of a subreddit, but the most effective way is through modmail. This is something that we should all be doing more often. We also need to find a way to improve communication between the mods of different subreddits. For example, I'd like to see us start using modmail to discuss policy decisions. We could even use it to discuss controversial topics like banning users. Another thing we could do is create an official subreddit policy. Right now, we have a bunch of unofficial policies that we try to follow, but they aren't always consistent. A good place to start would be to create a formal policy that we can point to when someone asks us about a rule violation. Finally, we need to get rid of the trolls. They're ruining the fun for everyone else. I'll admit that I haven't done much to stop them",
    "I'm not sure if this has been asked before, but I've noticed that many people on here are concerned about their hair and how it looks. I have long hair (about 5 inches) and I am very happy with it. It's a little bit messy at times, but I think it works for me. However, there are some things that I would like to change about my appearance. I want to be more feminine in general, so I'd like to try wearing dresses or skirts instead of jeans. I also want to wear makeup more often. I don't know what else to do. Should I cut my hair short? What should I do about my face?\n\nThis question was posed by user /u/dont_give_a_fuck_and_just_be_me, who wrote:\n\nYou're right, you look great! You can definitely go for a shorter haircut though. If you really want to keep your hair out of your face, then you could just grow it out. But I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you're willing to sacrifice something else. For example, you might lose some of your facial features. Or you might get acne. Or you might end up looking like an old man. Whatever you decide, make sure you talk to someone about it first.\n\nAnother redditor, /u/jimmybob, responded:\n\nIf you want to keep your hair out of your face, then you need to grow it out. The only thing that will work is growing it out until it reaches your shoulders. Then trimming it back. That way you'll still have a nice length, but you won't have any visible hair on your face.\n\nAnd another, /u/snowy_penguin, added:\n\nIt depends on what you want to achieve. If you want to look younger, then you may want to shave off some of your facial hair. If you want to look more mature, then you may want to grow your hair out.\n\nSo, which is better? Short hair or longer hair?",

    "I've been reading through some of the posts on this subreddit and I'm not sure if it's just me, but there seems to be an odd feeling about missing people in general. It's almost like they're out there somewhere, but we can't find them. There are so many stories of people who went missing and were never found, or their bodies turned up years later with no explanation as to how they died. The most common thing I hear is that they were abducted by aliens, which makes sense because that would explain why they'd disappear. But then there are all these other theories, such as Bigfoot, alien abductions, or even the Bermuda Triangle. And while I don't think any of those things are true (and I know for a fact that they aren't), I do believe that there is something more sinister going on here. Something that has us all on edge. Something that keeps us wondering what happened to our loved ones. Something that keeps us thinking about the unknown. Something that keeps us afraid. Something that keeps us searching for answers.

    "Just had another conversation on twitter and I don't think that pyro is too OP or too weak at all. I think that pyro is super strong. I think that the meta is very weird right now due to the meta changes and nerfs, but I don't think that pyro is weak. I don't think that he is weaker than any other hero. I think that pyro can be way more dangerous, but he also can deal with a lot of this hero's bad matchups and he just needs to learn to use his spells better. (A little bit more on this below) I think that pyro actually won't see a big nerf.\n\n(More on this problem below in my comments at the bottom of this post)\n\nHere at EGI we're gonna do a bit of a research on this, even though I've not had access to a PUBG character yet, I've been talking with a guy that plays with me (me being me) and just starting playing some, just to see what I think of this and see if we can come up with some interesting info. I'll be getting back to writing about it in a bit, but I want to say that I think that pyro is really OP, in my opinion, and he plays really well with our current meta that we have now, his playstyle just fits the meta in a really interesting way.\n\nBut, not only can he make the \"top\" players (which I will get into below) lose to the \"bottom\" (me being me) who play the \"best\" PUBG characters... he can go against the \"best\" PUBG teams that are still missing (but I'll get into that below, also this has been brought up in the official EGI forums already but I wanted to add it here for reference) and get them beat. He is super effective (I don't know what to call it) against the \"average playstyle\" of the average PUBG player, but his playstyle is super effective against certain playstyle of the top teams/top players. The difference between the top teams vs the top players is really huge.\n\n\nLet's say that you're playing with a pyro on a team of 6, your team consists of 2 good",
    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I was wondering what people thought about the term \"looking Spanish\". It's used in a lot of places to describe someone who looks like they're from Spain or Latin America (or both). The problem with it is that it doesn't make any sense. If you look at a picture of a person and say \"that guy/girl looks like he/she could be from Spain\", then you are assuming that they have some sort of Spanish accent. That's just not true. There are many different accents in Spain, and there are also many different ways to speak Spanish. So when you say \"looks like he/she could be from Spain\", you're basically saying \"he/she speaks Spanish like me\". And that's not necessarily a bad thing. But it does mean that you don't know anything about them. You can't tell whether they've lived here for years or if they moved here recently. They might even be speaking English. In fact, most people who live in Spain aren't native speakers of Spanish. Most Spaniards learn their language as children, so they don't really get to use it much outside of school. So when you say \"looks like he/she could be from Spain\", you're essentially saying \"he/she speaks Spanish like me\". And that's not necessarily a bad thing.

    "http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/i5n3x/what_is_the_heat_limit_of_ram_and_what_does_it/\n\nRPM on a system may be the best indicator of performance, and RAM should be the number one element of a system with high performance. RAM can play an important role in any high-end system that uses a good amount of RAM, and the number one factor in the performance of a ram-less system is the speed of the RAM. However, in the world of gaming, where the CPU, GPU and all of those other components are often heavily taxed, the speed of a system's RAM can make all the difference. A faster ram can make it possible to have a quicker response time to what you're doing while still being able to fully utilize the performance of your GPU at the same time: it is for that reason that RAM was the reason in the Xbox 360 that Microsoft was able to deliver an increase in performance over their last generation systems (or the PS3 and some other consoles).\n\nIt is also a factor in the heat dissipation of the system itself. When a system's speed and RAM speed are as well matched as possible, the heat is dissipated more quickly, and more evenly, which is why a system with high-speed ram usually has less heat than one with low-speed ram or one with slower ram running out of stock. Another benefit of higher speed ram is that it will actually be less effective at cooling an overheating system, and will require more cooling to prevent it from overheating in the first place.\n\nAs someone who runs a custom build around 1600 RAM, all of which I've overclocked, I've seen how many people either build a system with high heat because they don't understand the importance of how speed affects performance, or they build a system with high heat because they simply aren't aware of how RAM affects performance (or they believe that an overclocked (albeit high-pwm) ram will do this while a stock ram will only heat up the GPU and CPU at the same time). The reason you see people building a system that is only able to function, or can barely be sustained, when it is capable of running stable at very high speeds",

    "This week I was visiting my mom in her hometown where she had just retired with high hopes about new jobs and an increasing circle of friends, including some great young kids (some are now adults). When this particular group got together to talk, my grandmother became very emotional, especially when talking about how tough it's been taking care of our parents in their old age…and not being able to really visit them anymore. After being so for many years they were pretty much our own family for that year or two. After all these years coming here only to hear her break down I realized something important about grandparents who have no one else and become extremely dependent on each other to survive.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to realize why.\n\nWhen we visited them they would tell us how grateful they were to actually see my father again after spending 30+ years apart because they never imagined he'd get home. Even more shocking I noticed they took advantage every chance they could by trying to show off to others what kind of caregiving work my father is doing here as well as making sure he never complained. My brother said his relatives constantly try to make sure he always had food for me every night at 8p (to my sister) and stuff like that. I remember once my grandfather insisted my cousin and brothers come spend the weekend on this farm they owned called Old Willow Creek Ranch because he promised they wouldn't be hungry the entire time! They spent the whole weekend enjoying themselves. Every part of me wants to tell that story, but that isn't the place for today so just know this experience wasn't typical at all….the fact people still tried to do things like that just makes my grandmother feel even worse about herself. For many years everyone assumed if he did complain it could cause problems between him and the rest of the family. It was really sad hearing it. I believe they've been working hard to improve everything and the fact they're still struggling with getting there is heartbreaking!!\n\nI'm sharing this since I think it needs to happen. I also don't want any old granny to forget about how she has left her kids with these people or feel guilty for the lack a support system for their lives.\n\nEven as far back as high school when my grandfather first started going door-to-door selling property he used to brag how proud he was of how good their lifestyle was with",
    "Do you find it hard to follow complex, well-defined processes like a structured process? Do you feel the need for rules that are clearly defined, and written down in easy-to-understand writing? If so, this is probably the position of your dreams! Let me ask you something: How often do you check on the progress of a project or implementation, either due to frustration that the goal has not been reached or because you want to make sure that everything still works?\n\nIf you answered with a very high frequency (most likely), I'm afraid you're too late. As an engineer at a large enterprise for over 15 years now, I've seen many projects start off on some great trajectory where they look promising as long as one small detail was different from the rest and/or there were some unknowns that needed addressing. And then the project stagnates under the weight of all these problems. Sometimes I think even developers have no idea how long it takes you until everyone agrees that these two things are true : either a problem exists before you reach any point within the software system to handle the additional complexity. Or it goes to hell completely when someone adds another layer of abstraction which turns their new problem into a giant mess. Then everyone just keeps adding little pieces here and putting them together there. Maybe you can't find out why everyone's code sucks and what needs fixing but after a couple of months you finally see that someone forgot to add some important dependency which only came up when you re-thought about it. That usually happens once in a blue moon though since most projects fall from grace within six months to a year before we start thinking twice about trying them again. So don't listen to this advice if your project is running slowly or hasn't started growing yet unless you really feel strongly enough that you'll definitely be able to implement your vision when the time comes if you work very fast. But please consider that none of us know at any given moment how much time it will take so be patient to get there faster : it always does come quicker then expected if everyone acts quickly enough and correctly. The point is simple : nobody knows how difficult the journey actually has been until it reaches its end. Nobody cares what happened yesterday – what happened five weeks ago in a month? Nobody notices the roadwork that took eight months. Everyone moves only when we're ready and willing. Therefore when you begin your software career with an assignment",
    "I'm not sure if this is an actual story or just a joke, but it's pretty funny. It started when my wife and I were out for lunch at a local restaurant. We had been talking about how we'd like to go on vacation sometime soon so she suggested we take our dogs with us. She said they would be happy in their new home. I agreed and then asked her what kind of dog she wanted. She told me she wanted a German Shepherd. I thought that sounded perfect since I have two German Shepherds (one male and one female). So I bought them both a week before we left. The next morning I went into work and got ready for work. As I walked through the door I saw my wife walking towards me with the two dogs. I smiled and waved as I opened the door. My heart skipped a beat because I knew exactly what was going to happen. She looked up at me and said \"You're leaving?\" I replied \"Yes\" and she said \"No you're staying!\" I laughed and said \"Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow.\" She turned around and walked away. I stood there for a moment thinking about what I should say. Then I realized that I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. So I said \"Goodbye, honey! See you tomorrow!\" And I walked out the door. A few minutes later I came back inside and noticed my wife was standing by the front door waiting for me. I smiled and waved again and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved once more and she responded \"See ya tomorrow!\" I smiled and waved",

    "Hi. I'm Lauren. I have a 5 year old daughter called Lilly & I've been on the birth process for approximately 4.5 years. I recently had a c section and didn't have a choice. I have heard a ton of horror stories about baby-sits, birth groups, induction, etc. All I need from you is: * My experience from being in the birth process. * Your experience from birth. * Your thought processes during birth, specifically when you were deciding to keep or throw out your doula. * What was your birth experience like? So far the most negative experience has come from my doula, as have been the most positive experiences. I don't know how you have been but my opinion will help. She has been amazing for both my mom & myself!\n\nFrom my experience, we found out after that we were to have a cesarean section. I remember as a child, I always wanted to be as small as possible for my body to be in the best shape to give me the best life I possibly could. As a baby I wanted my birth to be as much like a natural birth as possible. It was a hard position to find but we did it. After this decision we went to a birth school in Denver, Colorado. They put our entire first year plan in front of the moms and we just did it. A bit of time was spent figuring out our baby's weight. And we did it. We did it as a family. We did it in a way that was supportive & comfortable. I didn't want a vaginal birth. I had a really hard time coming to the decision. We went to 5 doctor's appointments in 5 days between our first doctor visit before having the cesarean section, and when my daughter was born. This was only 4 hours before she was born. She was a healthy little girl (she weighed 4 lbs and a half at birth) And by 4 hours after she was born she was breathing on her own. When she was born, she didn't have me in her mouth for the first two hours and she was still breathing on her own at 5 hours after. It's a lot to wrap your head around. I had read everything I could on other people's experiences. We went into the hospital with a c",

    "What can I do to convince my wife that we need to work on our relationship?\n\nWe're not having a good fight. We started this relationship as friends and have been dating on and off for 3 years now. But then she started getting nasty at best and totally irrational at worst. It started as her being angry that she's not getting as much attention as I do (which I don't really notice since none of it is real) but has gotten progressively worse.\n\nShe also recently started sending me \"intimacy and lovey-dovey stuff\" that has made me realize that we haven't been honest with each other. I don't care how good she is at the game, I don't see anything that is honest and makes me feel like we're a real couple when all we do is fight about stuff.\n\nI hate having these feelings and I'm just as confused as you. We both like to work on our relationship and I feel like she's doing the exact opposite. I'm honestly tired of these arguments and we've been arguing about things that can't be solved through arguments so I'm asking if you can help me start a discussion to see what we can come to with a solution to our relationship problems – if you think she's doing something wrong or maybe we should change the way we work on our relationship. Thanks!",
    "I'm not sure if you've heard about it but in Finland, all Holmes novels and short stories are still protected by copyright for this strange reason. The reason is that they were written before 1923 when the law was changed to protect authors' rights. So basically, the books have been around since then, but because they weren't published until after 1923, they're considered as works made before 1923. This means that they can be copyrighted again, even though they haven't been published yet. I don't know how many people actually read these books, but I think there's probably more than one person who has bought them on ebay or Amazon.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Is this fair? Do you agree with me?",
    "(i dont know why i took the risk, but i did)\n\nHi All! This is 21M who posted on my personal thread and was like \"I just found that I am living with an abusive partner\" as the title says. My fiancé and I met in 8th grade (5 yrs old at that time). We dated for 3 years until our breakup 2 months ago after being together 3 years. After this break up, our relationship went through hell...my fiancé even tried to control me and tell me that he could help take care off of my health. Before starting in high school, I had no anxiety or major problems like insomnia. Now I have all these health issues because our love ended so long-ago....so this is my story about how our relationship started into what it really turned into....\n\nAbout our love\n\nDuring middle school, I was always in the spotlight as my friend's best friend. While she didn't feel that my personality suited her, I had confidence and we became friends and later graduated together. In junior high, in my late teens, everything came falling apart again. She said we weren't compatible anymore; she said most girls wouldn't date us anyhow. Of course when I responded something along-looking back to say I still wanted to see her eventually (but only if she liked me), or asked her out, it resulted to her saying she wasn't going to go out with me even though I wasn't feeling the same way. So now in high school, the drama starts again.\n\nAs a senior, one thing that brought us closer again, besides having been seniors already, was we both had exams coming up soon/during school hours. I would make a plan for a day I'm free before school, and while doing so, it caused tension between us. Now we are in another relationship yet, but in this case, because she hadn't seen an exam lately, I would come home right after school with homework done (without meeting her on Tuesday or Saturday). Because I never felt anything emotionally towards her anymore, I decided that since I wasn't experiencing any love feelings toward her, then we ended this thing with the exam weekend issue. Also...we went out a lot, just not more than once every couple days and were very passionate about each other romantically...for however short periods of time (sometimes",
    "Here's what's in my opinion. For people like me it's not really about the attitude of people getting on a bus or train, even if it's on a slow day. All it's really about is this belief that as a person with a certain background I'm supposed to look down on people of a different background who live a different way of life. There's a difference between looking at a map and seeing a giant blob of land and making comparisons of that blob of land to things inside the blob, or making the assumption that the land of England comes from the same place as the land of Africa, etc. What we're talking about is the attitude that \"I'm entitled too, but because I've had this really hard life, I know I deserve it better than you. And maybe because I'm an upper middle class white heterosexual male it must be my moral and social duty to show respect for other people because I have more privileges and they don't\". And once you start thinking like that, it's pretty easy to go from that point of view to believing (in your mind) that some people are inferior and deserve whatever they get. And the last straw comes when you start to see the world not through your own filters but through the filters of a wider culture from where you get all your information, and your view of the world can start to look very narrow and narrow-minded. And of course once you start trying to make other people happy with things like being nice to people rather than giving what you think is what's best, you can start to lose your respect for them and feel a bit resentful of them. There's a bunch of things I've learned in my life about how people can be very prejudiced. One thing is that people are very self-conscious. They always want to be seen as 'nice' people. That is a huge problem and one of the big problems in society, a little bit like that feeling that we're all entitled, because we've only been poor for a very short time. So it's really important that we don't give people any comfort just because they look like someone you know. And I really strongly believe that this feeling of superiority is really dangerous and it destroys relationships. And again in terms of this issue of racism. But it's a problem in society and particularly among minority groups because if",

How does that make you feel? Feel good, for sure. But not as good as a happy person.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/buddhism/comments/1vl6s1/you_are_not_good_enough/\n\nI can help you with your meditation. Here's the meditation. I'd like to see the results. You are not ready mentally. If not mentally, you can still meditate - feel the breath or some of the aspects. If you take the advice seriously and just concentrate you will get that results.\n\nThis is not to give you false promise. This is a test to see if you are ready and mentally prepared. You will not see results immediately. It takes a while.\n\nDo you feel a little bit better? Good, that's a bonus. You're in the right place and it's not a waste of time. I have some more suggestions.\n\nNow, what does this \"just meditating\" have to do with that meditation room? Well I need to check if a monk's mind is capable of it. What does \"just\" mean? Meditation is not something you do once in a particular place, to a certain degree - it's a lifestyle. You may not meditate every day but you will come to meditate again and again. And I need to know for this to be possible.\n\nBut this was not sufficient, because a monk's mind is much better capable of concentration than this average human mind, which is not capable of concentration as well. A monk's mind will produce better results than this.\n\nSo I needed some other answers. Something that was more specific and specific than \"just meditating\" that would tell me if a monk was capable of the meditation that I wanted.\n\nHere is what you need to know: you may need to \"burst\" in order to get results.\n\nThe Buddha said: \"If you do not meditate",

    "Hi, I'm a redditor who's been lurking here for a while now and have noticed that there are some pretty big differences between how men and women talk about their feelings on Reddit. For example, when it comes to depression, men tend to use words like \"depressed,\" \"sad,\" or \"down.\" Women, however, tend to say things like \"angry,\" \"frustrated,\" or \"upset.\" So what gives? Why do we use different language? Well, as it turns out, there's actually quite a bit of research into why people use certain words differently. In fact, one study found that men and women use these terms with very similar frequency, but they're used in very different ways. Here's an excerpt from the article:\n\nIn a recent study published in Psychological Science, researchers at the University of California-Berkeley examined the usage of four common emotional expressions (anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise) among more than 1,000 participants across five countries. The results showed that men and women use these emotions in very similar ways, but men use them in a way that's much more specific and focused. Men expressed anger by using words such as \"angry,\" \"disgusted,\" \"shocked,\" \"surprised,\" and \"disturbed.\" Women expressed sadness by using words such as \"sad,\" \"pained,\" \"bitter,\" \"worried,\" and \"dismayed.\" And women expressed disgust by using words such as \"grossed out,\" \"scared,\" \"nervous,\" and \"offended.\"\n\nSo, if you want to know why men use the word \"angry\" instead of \"angry,\" then read this article. If you want to know why women use the word \"sad\" instead of \"sad,\" then read this article. If you want to know why men use the word \"frustrated\" instead of \"frustrated,\" then read this article. But if you want to know why women use the word \"upset\" instead of \"upset,\" then read this article.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about the psychology behind emotion, check out my book Emotional Intelligence.",

    "You see some really, really lame stuff here on FANFICTION, or at least my part of it anyway. There is no sense trying to get around that fact! In this I will include two very minor spoilers (I just can't help myself) for one game! Let's start at the beginning. As you probably remember from Game 1 with your parents reading to you, what happens when all eight kids are trapped together within a giant basement? You play as either Michael, Dougie, Bonnie or Chica and try to figure out how they survived it without killing each other over tiny scraps of food (which unfortunately are not distributed evenly.) Once the escape plan was worked out, everyone had a quick party before the credits rolled, but since both Michael, Dougie and Bonnie have been shown alive and well in previous games, this is pretty much just a re-hash of the event that happened in last year's run. Now take a step back here… Michael died… the only kid who hasn't died – why would I write something so horrible about one dead character… right?! But wait, there's more.\n\nNow we get where I'm gonna start talking bad things…. I never thought it'd actually happen here to me in FNAF!, even though I was the main reason he died and not Jason who almost killed him off twice before killing him and turned into his monster form in game 0-1. And now after playing multiple times I've come to realize that there is some sort of reason to think that this may be the case. After several months thinking about it recently while trying to finish up FNAF6, I realized three things: The whole theme of the first four games could apply to this; Freddy Krueger may have some more supernatural abilities or maybe some kind of psychic connection to these children through them finding him in their dreams; There is absolutely no way he survived game 5 in his current state, which I will explain later. So here goes.\n\nTHE PONTERA CONNECTION IN THE FIRST GAME HAD TO BE A TRAP\n\nWhen I sat down and read the notes in the intro of those games, I noticed that FNAF1 and 2 were the ones that actually made reference to Freddy being inside a door with them and that he could interact with them if pushed slightly enough. Of",
    "I just got off shift and happened to look out my door as I left. There was an American Express sign on it. It said 'CO'. I'm so confused…\n\nMy brother works full-time in one of CO.'s largest office buildings near where I live (Tuesdays). He's pretty much always working on Mondays (he didn't come back that day which made me question if he really did have a scheduled meeting due tomorrow.) This is the first time we've ever had any kind of conflict and our manager hasn't spoken with us about anything serious except about paperwork and when she needs someone to pick up workbooks for her office. No one has been there before because our place is the size of one of their offices. That said, this morning he showed up around 11am after showing up later last night for roll call and then promptly arrived before anyone else during lunch. We talked briefly afterwards but after work when he got home, he started drinking heavily, which caused some confusion. He told me, \"hey bro\" about his coworker who he says approached him and questioned what drinks he ordered because he wasn't drinking enough of them….when asked whether alcohol or drugs were involved, he replied yes to both. They discussed when they're going to hit pool together (he's a fairly competitive gamer) and started hanging out more again after work where two cars showered the area on a hot sunny Saturday afternoon and he ended up having second thoughts when he saw my phone ringing, went to answer it and he'd still finished drinking and passed out immediately after hearing her talk on the other end, apparently having nothing better to do than hear two very drunk women arguing loudly over whose turn it is to do laundry or drop kids off for soccer game.\n\nAt the moment we are all kinda wondering how they get away with this stuff? How can you go so long without dealing with a problem like this in your own community! How do people expect everyone else to handle their problems that easily and that quickly?! What must happen in the HR department!! When will this thing run its course??!!",
    "(edited for length, no images below)\n\nHi, I'm a new redditor; I'm new to reddit, and this is actually my first time creating a sticky post. This will be my first post, and I can only think of another similar example. I'm taking an in-depth look into whether it's rude to move someone's laundry. I'm assuming no one reading this has a laundry problem, and I'm going to be fairly straightforward with my results. My only goal in this experiment is to understand the social nature of this question, and how different people answer. Now, there isn't a perfect analogy that would perfectly illustrate what I'm trying to learn. I'm making these assumptions on behalf of the poster; if you feel like the analogy you described is more appropriate to this post, I'd appreciate an upvote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, I took this post and made the following post on \"cleaning a person's dirty laundry\" (see what happened there?) about the same topic, but instead focused on washing, drying, and using. My first thought was to check the word \"rudely\" (as \"selfishly\") in every single post that used \"moving laundry.\" I could read the exact same text above, but I think I'd get more out of my understanding, especially if I considered my personal opinion of the matter. So that's what I did. I wrote a simple sentence:\n\nDo you find it rude to move the laundry?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I wrote down every single post I saw. Some of these people answered \"no,\" some of these people answered \"yes,\" but many people (almost all of them) answered \"yes\" in this statement of their own volition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thing to keep in mind and keep in mind while looking at these results is that the text that ended up answering the question (and the one in the OP) was very important. In my opinion:\n\nYou should not ever answer a question like this on social media.\n\nI'm not talking about responding with text only. I'm talking about leaving a comment, answering or refuting a question/response. It was an answer that brought me to see how other people answer/respond to this question; how we all seem to handle it differently. Do you answer this question with text,",

One day, she told me that she loved me even if she wouldnít get anything she wanted. She told me then that sheíd do whatever it took so I could achieve my dreams and be the man that I wanted to be. At the age of 19, I went off to college to get my Bachelorís degree. I worked at the same job I do today, I graduated with my Bachelors and then proceeded to do my M.S.

When the time came for me to retire, I knew it was important for me to make sure that my kids did a great job of making sure that their dad was a good person as well. My wife, who had been with my mother since the age of 14, left my father to become a school teacher while I moved out to Los Angeles and became a teacher for myself. I have come to appreciate our marriage even more after seeing what my father has become and what he has become in relation to my wife. After all the things that I have done for this family, I am starting to see how selfish and unrespectful my family can be. My father is a loving person with his own faults and it is not my role as their father to fix everything that the family does not agree with. I am going to do what is right for this family, without any regard to their feelings or opinions, even if it means that I will have to give up my teaching status.

    "From the moment I loaded my VR headset, the SteamVR experience instantly felt more than my computer could possibly handle. There's just too much input latency. For example, when I put down the controller and reach a new area, the controller cursor quickly zooms to a single point. Then I press the trigger and the new cursor returns, with no delay between when I press the trigger and what happens. I keep holding the trigger and still the cursor stays on the same target, like an in-game weapon trigger. When I move my head around, each time it moves, an additional, awkward pause happens, often not enough to notice. I don't know if this is a software issue, or a hardware issue (I have a Vive, with a decent Nvidia graphics card), or something with the headset itself, but it's really annoying. I imagine a high-end headset with a more powerful GPU would be more stable in this case, like the Rift, but there's no way to be sure.\n\nI started playing an FPS for a while, but soon found I could only control one character. I tried that in single player for a few minutes, but it quickly became too frustrating after repeated failures. I ended up switching to a multiplayer \"game\" mode, where two or more players could control one character but still see the other characters, but the experience wasn't much better:\n\nEvery time I enter an area, I get a sudden jerk from my virtual head and my physical movement is completely random – from the way the mouse appears to the way I'm looking around.

My body feels totally out-of-place when I move my head to the side. The head tracking and the body tracking get more and more inconsistent as time goes on. While initially I could just walk right through doorways, I would suddenly find myself moving straight into doors, doors I can't actually move through in the real world.\n\nI decided I was too sick to play any more, but even after a half-hour of nonstop play, I can't think of a single game I'm even trying to put it together in.

    "The other thing that people don't seem to take into consideration is that most people think that \"creative\" means you're \"the person who put pen to paper\", but that's not at all how it's defined in the context of survival. \"Creative\" is defined as the ability to find a unique solution, creative solution, because the only thing that's \"creative\" about us is our own laziness. Because if you had to be creative (as you are, most of the time, your creativity is totally useless) you'd have to, you know, work harder than the person next to you. That's why most people think that creativity means that you put something down on an easel and then have a lot of fun writing stuff down and posting it to the internet to \"prove that you are a genius\". The truth is that creative people are basically lazy. They do this because laziness gives them the best means by which to solve problems. Creativity is only useful to you and the people you know. For every person who's really creative, there's 100 people who're not creative. Most people are simply using creativity as an excuse not to do something they should be doing and it's getting worse.\n\nYou can see why this has sparked such a firestorm, because a lot of people seem to buy into this idea that creativity is actually an important aspect of the survivalist. I suppose this is something that you can't help but fall back on, especially with any sort of post about survivalist stuff on the internet. It makes it easier for people to justify spending a lot of time writing down their ideas, and it puts that writing down as something that the user has accomplished. It feels important and you're \"creating\" something. It's a really appealing thing.\n\nI'm not going to go into too much detail about this here, because there're two reasons I think people should focus on the first part of the post. First of all, I don't think it's all that important, and secondly, it may not resonate with other survivalists at all. I can't stress enough how much time we spend on this, I find it ridiculous. Most of our \"craft\" is just us sitting around trying to remember what we saw in survival movie movies when we were teenagers. We can easily get by with a few pages",

    "Dear Reddit, I'm interested in your opinion on this very hot topic. In short there are two aspects to my CV and if you read them together they make up about 70% of my value (plus I have other qualities you will probably only find on an extensive resume). Here are their parts, and please comment any thoughts you may have: 1) A-Levels (I got 4/7 of them right and 3/7 wrong): I was one of two or three students who achieved top grades at second level as well as the final grade. I took them because that's how it should be done if we want to become academic coaches for top players and also because i can't stand wasting money on people who try to pass themselves off as academics but only end up hurting myself rather than achieving something valuable – so many times they do their own school work just to show their teachers where to put their name next time around. 2) Experience with Youth Development and Under 18 League football: Most importantly these were my experiences and my knowledge as they were relevant not only during my coaching career but in life as well, so please understand i did them all when most kids would know exactly half of what i did in these roles and that included working closely with local youth teams and clubs when my involvement in U18/Under 17 league football began. This helps differentiate me from some others for anyone who cares - as there will always come a place for someone who has an impressive track record playing league football. There were various things i learned through this first hand working alongside the players, including (some i didn't quite like) their lack of maturity which means that sometimes mistakes were made because they weren't particularly experienced. I had a couple occasions like this and so my actions back then influenced how things were handled later along. My biggest problem with young kids nowadays is that too often what has worked really well for me was thrown out the window in favour of giving them every single thing a little bit more of the first time around – i don't go into teaching/working placements too much and that helped get things going with these youngsters quite a lot quicker then i'd think, just by understanding each individual youngster a little better, how things went wrong (or right), why it happened and why they changed course after those initial errors so to speak. And this ties back into getting in touch with the children again – sometimes we're in situations where",

    "So I got dinner on Friday night out for my date and had tacos, burritos and guacamole. After we finished our first round of tacos and started picking them off the large plate, there was another order to be made; more guac, rice & beans. This one I was able to take care of quickly, as I already had my drink in-hand. The second order came up and I took care of it almost immediately (since that wasn't my normal job duty). When it comes time to pay, however, the cashier is being extremely rude! She tells me that her manager told her not even to do anything else with those tickets since they were hers, but not ours. So, she takes both tickets and gives them back to him who is then supposed to keep them? In all honesty, I've never been paid twice by an employee before but that's not really why this bothered me. What bothers me is that most of his customers are black or latino so if he'd only have been nice to those people, not giving these men a chance might not have caused such a stir. This would be a small problem if these guys weren't doing a pretty decent job, especially considering nobody said anything to make any white customers feel uncomfortable. I guess this guy didn't learn his lesson so what am I saying here, he probably just didn't care and thinks women don't deserve respect because, well, she's a woman...",
    "My husband bought me a gift that I didn't want. It was a large, beautiful, white leather necklace. It was something he'd picked out specifically for me, something he'd been planning for two weeks but I hadn't seen.\n\nI was excited, as I always am when the holidays roll around, but it just wasn't the present I wanted. A necklace, I didn't want a necklace! I was, like, \"Wait, maybe it's different, I don'’t know,\" which was not a very satisfying answer and would have left me feeling pretty dumb the next day.\n\nHe picked out some other things for me that morning and I was very confused by that too. All of the presents under my tree were things I liked, but still, I felt slightly dejected.\n\nIn the end, I left with a big frown, and I wish he hadn't at all.\n\nIn order to understand why this present wasn't my favorite, I'll share with you my history of Christmas. I go back a lot. It took me a while to settle into it, but over time I've learned a lot about that period.\n\nMy family is the most diverse Christmas family I've ever seen. My best friend lives in the Philippines, and her husband and I moved a very long time ago. When I was young, my family lived in a very rural part of the United States, and that was one of the major factors that made Christmas different than it is now (though this wasn't always the case.)\n\nWhen I was younger, my mom would often bring a gift and insist on making a joke during the wrapping or gift exchange. She would be laughing so hard she would put up her hands and start wiping her feet before she said a word.\n\nThis gave her a good sense of humor about Christmas, which helped with being a jokey family the rest of the year. I've always found her humor funny. I don't know, maybe a part of me has always been that way.\n\nIt's been a few years since I've had real conversations with my mom about Christmas. But I'm going to share this story because I think it's important to know that she always made time at the holidays for those she loved. My mom loved to prepare food just as much as she loved",
    "I'm working at a store and I noticed we have very few female staff in my department; no clerks, no stock guys, etc – basically nobody to talk to about what's going on. The co-workers aren't that awesome either because they're usually super busy in other departments or if you talk to one you can never get him off topic since he will always tell you he has something to do after work which means he will not help out customers who need assistance during the day. My co-worker, I can pretty much guess, works in Customer Service (Customer Service being the only major section for male employees) and the two times I've asked her about customer support she gave me weird stares like I was asking them how their morning went, saying things like:\n\n\n\"you all are terrible! You should feel bad because there isn't anything we want you to worry about around here.\" And before even getting into any conversation it became clear she doesn't really know stuff other than Customer Service stuff like having your order ready by X date so then just go home and relax while your coworkers eat their breakfast. They also don't understand that people sometimes have problems on their own, but rather are trying to resolve those issues more often than they actually do. When the manager saw this I called through for him on his cell phone to see what needs to be done. He said all that he could say is they had to go over schedules and make sure everything is running correctly as needed. She just continued on and told me they're looking to hire someone for our new position to replace our current clerk. I told him we tried to inform her of why it was a good idea for us, but she kept putting her hands in her pockets and staring across the room trying to figure anything out while continuing to answer questions she had to give.

    "Kazuna's development from an almost-feral cat, to his current self and ultimately his final sacrifice in episode twenty-two makes it seem almost as hard for me to watch now that I've watched it than it was then. It certainly made more sense at the time but looking back just how much he has grown since the start of the series doesn't make the loss any less tragic when you first see, let alone experience, how it all came about. This is especially true of Kazuna, whose early episodes may have been quite strong on their own yet quickly faded. As long as one forgets this, however, the ending gives way to the beginning only a little too effortlessly.\n\nWhile watching Kazuna struggle with deciding if he wants to survive, his loneliness during each moment is palpable. When he says 'I'm so lonely' or 'no matter where I go there's no one here', everything is conveyed perfectly by the actor's speech and voice-over. However, he does eventually speak after many agonizing moments, and in truth what we perceive through his eyes are more a mix between disappointment at his circumstances and desperation to change things. It gets him through and helps him come to terms with his position as one who must die for survival. However, it also leaves us unsure as to whether this can be done (and at a crucial point in the story), which makes the conclusion a bit disappointing with its abrupt reveal. The fact the show actually ends as soon as it starts is a wonderful touch considering every other piece that made up it had such impact in creating their respective plot points, especially Kazama's decision to kill his old childhood friend Ryohei Koyuki and then proceed into the wilderness. At least the latter part of his arc is satisfying in its entirety, ending in the most painful way possible. So while he suffers greatly over losing others rather than the world around him, the journey is all worth it; they both made good choices.\n\nFor people thinking the same things about these characters — especially myself— perhaps I should give some special mention to Yusei Matsui's performance, which I don't consider well out-of-character at all either. His portrayal of the most troubled individual in existence left nothing hidden from anyone paying attention, both positively and negatively. Though his intentions were always to save Kazuma he became an extreme antagonist to everyone",

    "\"I'm now 37 years old, and have never had an orgasm. I feel I have done so many immoral things that I cannot enjoy life anymore and I cannot allow myself to be happy in any way.

    "I'm not sure if this is an actual thing or just something I've been thinking about, but I think that there's a lot to be said for choosing your own path in life. It doesn't have to mean going down a particular road and making certain choices, but rather being able to make decisions based on your values and beliefs. For me, I don't want to go through life feeling like I should do things my parents would approve of, or that society expects of me. I want to live my life as freely as possible, and I want to be able to say yes when people ask me to do things. I also want to be able to say no when people try to force me into doing things I don't want to do. I know that sounds silly, but I really believe that it's important to be able to say no to people who are trying to push you into doing things you don't want to do. I think that's why I was so upset by the news about the new Ghostbusters movie. The idea that women can't be funny without men around seems ridiculous to me. If anything, I'd argue that women need men around them more than they need other women. I think that's one of the reasons why I love comedy so much. Comedy is such a great way to get people talking about themselves, and getting people to talk about their feelings. And I think that's exactly what the new Ghostbusters movie does. It makes fun of itself, and then it gets people talking about how funny it is. That's all it needs to do. But instead, the film has been criticized for its lack of female characters. This isn't surprising, because the original Ghostbusters had only three female characters (and two of those were played by women). So, while I understand why some people might find the new Ghostbusters movie disappointing, I think it's worth noting that the criticism is misguided. There are plenty of ways to tell stories with women in them, and the new Ghostbusters movie is one of them.\n\nThis is a very interesting point, and I agree wholeheartedly. As someone who grew up watching the original Ghostbusters, I remember how much I loved seeing the ladies of the team together. They were always hilarious together, and I loved the fact that they could take each other's jokes. I also liked the fact that they weren't afraid to call out the",

I don't know this for certain, but I'm thinking my dad might have gotten himself into some bullshit with one of the girls at college I'm a pretty good friend with. Maybe her mom was also involved. Either way, this dude and I always had this conversation about him and his dad. He's a good guy, but I just don't know what the truth is. He knows he'd like to see me as his own, and I also feel like it would be a good thing for the both of us at the same time, but he doesn't know about this. And now we both don't know about this. And this whole thing has caused him a lot of stress and the stress of being caught in a bad situation.

Please read carefully: 1) We have received notification on 3 March 2016 that these guys (Celero & Aramex?) have decided to cease the exchange of money due to uncertainty surrounding them continuing on with GBTC. 2) If your application for exchange/solution was accepted before March 3rd you would still be eligible under the agreement and you could not get out until this period has expired or you withdraw your funds. However we cannot offer any guarantees of continued service given the current state of affairs and also if we end up needing to make further enquiries through banks there seems little hope we won't start over with new customers again given the current situation on international transactions which leaves us with no choice but to terminate our agreement with the two companies involved. We understand it may seem unfortunate this has happened as it appears there were people's hopes and dreams being crushed simply because they had not yet heard or understood fully what their options now were. This in no way represents the views either party currently hold, nor does that imply an official statement on where we stand regarding further actions should we need to pursue legal avenues. At this stage we at Moneycorp wish everyone well when you receive a call stating how things are going for him - we wish you all happiness whilst he continues his career abroad - and you ourselves enjoy enjoying his products & services once you become part of his extended family! So please pass this message along to your friends in order that they too benefit from what he has created. Any other concerns you have etc., you obviously would be the first one to reach out to; unfortunately, due to the time I'm sitting/working at present, getting anyone else to deal directly with such a complex question, even though technically correct would likely prove impossible outside our company's normal day-to-day business processes. I would hope you could agree that as something very similar has already occurred to us and others around the world, that we must move swiftly before it becomes a more global problem down the line. We do this in support of our clients. What do those clients want? How do they feel",

    "I've been having constant issues on my Galaxy S8+ lately. In short, it constantly has random reboots to recovery mode. I have tried every combination possible for fixing this, ranging up to (and including) using bootloader unlock tools (like Eleiko), and that doesn't work. Since flashing another ROM worked fine back when its official update time was April 3rd, I thought I'd try wiping everything out as explained in this forum post here: [TIP] Delete your phone data & reset system cache using TWRP if you don't want to restore it/them! You should see some progress on your screen while this is going on and after 10 minutes will say complete. This procedure will wipe all information stored on your internal storage partition! Your new firmware install/flashing experience will then follow much like normal rooting and flashing processes – so continue on reading…\n\n\nIf this seems frustrating (to you!), please read through the above instructions again – and if nothing else, you can always follow the next steps as many people had success with, so there's no need to waste any more money on Google's support/help page. If none of that works or makes things worse than they are now, the best solution might be simply to wait a bit to get the situation sorted down better since your carrier may not provide a firmware fix at this time. Either way, feel free to use Reddit help community links below! We appreciate everyone who takes time to reply and answer questions in the thread. Thanks, friends!\n\n*Note - If you're currently experiencing these device reboots due to problems within your software/firmware, it could suggest some root cause (e.g.: corrupted files). Using the instructions included should resolve those symptoms! * Note 2 : With just a single reboot you can go back to an unrooted stock Galaxy S8 Plus. As stated previously, you can also run the same recovery-only/full flash process with each rooted/vendor rom in any order you wish: It won't work properly again unless you delete the precompiled file first and re-flash it with custom kernel/modem options provided by Vodafone via a different/new build!",
    "I've been single for two years now, and I'm still not sure why. It's hard to explain, but it feels like there are so many things that could be going on in my life right now that I just don't have time for anything sexual. I feel like I should be doing something with myself, but I can't seem to find the motivation or energy to do so. I know this isn't normal, but I think it might be because I haven't had sex in over 2 years. I'm not really looking for someone to date, but if you're interested in dating me, please let me know! I'd love to meet new people and see what happens. Thanks! -Ariel\n\nThis was posted by user /u/a_man_in_black on Reddit.com. The original poster has since deleted his account.\n\nRedditors were quick to respond to Ariel's post, some offering advice, others asking questions about her situation. Some even offered to help her out financially.\n\nOne Redditor wrote:\n\nYou need to get laid. You need to go out and meet women. If you want to keep your virginity, then you need to learn how to make yourself attractive to women. That means being more confident, being more outgoing, and learning how to flirt. You need to start taking care of yourself. Get off your ass and take care of yourself. Don't wait until you're married to start getting healthy.\n\nAnother redditor said:\n\nIf you're serious about finding a partner, you need to stop waiting around for someone to come along and give you a chance. You need to start making moves. Start talking to girls. Go out and talk to them. Be social. Make friends. Learn how to interact with other people. Find a hobby. Do whatever it takes to become more socially active.\n\nAnd another redditor suggested:\n\nGet a job. Work at McDonalds. Become an Uber driver. Anything that will put money into your pocket.\n\nBut one redditor pointed out that Ariel may actually be suffering from depression:\n\nShe seems depressed. She doesn't seem happy. She doesn't seem motivated. She doesn't seem to enjoy herself. She doesn't seem to have any hobbies. She doesn't seem to have any interests. She doesn't seem to have any goals. She doesn't",
    "We should also not ignore that there appears to be much financial aid going through IS (and possibly al Qaeda), and even the Islamic Front, al Nusra, etc. Not only were those groups financially supported by some very wealthy supporters within the West, but they have been able to take on fighters who could have likely been drawn directly from Western MI-6 and/or NATO intelligence agencies. Just today Wikileaks released a series of memos which clearly show that American assets in Syria are operating inside their own country via covert operations (dubbed CITIZENS ONLY). If we look more closely at this area we can see that one of the main financial backers for some parts of these rebel forces was US citizen George Soros, with his Open Society Foundations being involved quite heavily in supporting what now appear to be FSA rebels against Assad forces [14] It seems this entire area of funding has been created by Soros, because not only did these groups receive foreign support but several now find themselves fighting on opposite sides of a war that was supposed to be against al Qaida / ISIS. That is really scary when you think about it!\n\nAnd here's another picture from an op-ed that appeared at Alternet.org:\n\nSo far, the following pieces of research suggest evidence that the majority of Syrians who sought refuge within Europe, either for safety or to escape poverty during the so-called Arab Spring revolutions of 2011, had nothing whatsoever to do with ISIL and al Nusra terrorists. The following articles give just a few examples:\n\nMore analysis on that HERE.",

    "I am not going to go into detail about what happened in Germany during the 1930s, but suffice it to say that Hitler was elected by a majority of the population and he did not have to resort to violence or intimidation to get his way. He simply used fear as a tool to gain support for his policies. The same thing has been happening in America today with the Tea Party movement. They are using fear as a tool to gain support for their agenda. Fear is an effective motivator because it makes us feel powerless. It also gives us something to fight against. We can't do anything about our fears, so we turn to someone else who will help us. That's exactly what the Tea Party is doing. They are turning to fear to motivate their supporters. If you want to understand how this works, look at the comments section on any article about the Tea Party. You'll see all kinds of crazy stuff like \"If Obama gets re-elected, I'm moving out of my house.\" Or \"If Romney wins, I'm buying a gun.\" These are just some examples of the kind of things people are saying. But they're not really talking about politics. They're talking about themselves. And if you think about it, these comments aren't even political. They're self-motivated. People are making up their own minds based on their own experiences. So when you read them, you might be tempted to dismiss them as being made up by angry people. But that would be wrong. When you read them, you realize that these people are real people. They've had bad experiences in life, and they're trying to make sense of those experiences through their own personal stories. In other words, they're telling you what they believe to be true. And that's what the Tea Party is doing. They're telling you what they believe to be true. And that's what the American people need to hear more often.",
    "To the OP:\n\nLet's start with \"Bible-believing Christians\" here: if you're not Christian, I'd expect you to be saying \"no it doesn't\" in exactly the same way the atheists say \"no it doesn't\". If you're Christian, your belief is predicated on the assertion of the divinely-sanctioned author of the original text that God is the ultimate author of the English language. So if you're not actually religious, I would expect you to reject the view of a God who made the Bible, or at least recognize it as an imperfect and limited document.\n\nOn what basis is this belief the official policy of the Catholic church, which is a \"Christian\" organization and one of the largest denominations in the world? You can't say it's based on the Old and New Testaments, which the Catholic church says are inspired and authoritative and therefore divinely inspired, because the Catholic church and most of its adherents simply reject both the Old and New Testaments as \"infallible, infallible and inerrant\". So why assume to assert that God's words are infallible? If you reject the existence or divinity of an omnibenevolent, omniscient, omnipresent, infinitely loving, all-lauding, all-loving God, who speaks and speaks only in human language (in both senses of the term- he created the stars; he spoke into the first person of Adam that all who hear these words would be blessed with life; he spoke into Moses and said what God commanded to Moses; how can he not speak into the heart of man today to assure all of us that the works are good, the words spoken in His wisdom and goodness are eternal, that there is no reason not to believe in him and obey him if we know and believe the words by which he commanded us- why assume his intentions are infallible? Why take for granted something we have no valid reason to assume, given that there were thousands of Christians and numerous other religious groups (not to mention other faiths and philosophies), all of which have differing beliefs and reasons for rejecting the notion of a human omniscient, omnipresent and loving deity, one who speaks only in human language, as opposed to a divinely-inspired, all-lauding, all-loving deity with His own omniscient, omnipresent and loving thoughts",
    "As an American, I have no interest in exiting the United States. While I have enjoyed living in the US on and off for 25 years, I will be moving back to Asia as of January 1, 2018. Why? Because I'm not going to have to be forced to give up my citizenship to get medical coverage. And neither will my family. I don't want to leave my daughter with the government. I've been with her since she came along, I would not have had her if she had to return to China with no health coverage, or worse, get sick and end up in a situation where they'll force her to give her up. I'm not naive, I know the legal rights people who have become citizens since 9/11 lose with their change of nationality. But what she really deserves are opportunities, a place to live when she grows up, and decent standards of living with her own skills.\n\nHer father then commented that for immigrants with Chinese nationality, citizenship is merely a stamp on the passport that gives you visa-free access to the US as a tourist. He then added, \"I can't even get into Hong Kong legally, we just got caught up in the 'one country, two systems' concept once again with some stupid red tape.\"\n\nWhen the discussion reached a critical mass, she came out of her personal outrage against Trump by revealing her true opinion, \"I wish they would stop being so mean, this has been going on since Trump arrived. They just hate him, he's not even an American, everyone who's a foreigner is automatically treated like a terrorist unless they can prove otherwise.\"\n\nThere were some reactions to her post from pro-Trump users. One of them said, \"She has been silent forever. She is on the opposite side. I can see that. A traitor.\" (Note: I'm not on the pro-Trump subreddit, but if it's true, this is a pretty vile thing to say to someone…) Another commented, \"She's in Hong Kong, and her nationality has nothing to do with it.\" And another commenter added, \"The situation is just the same. It's a Chinese passport. She has no business there.\"\n\n[Featured Image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images]",
    "\"I know I should have left right away when I found out my wife was cheating. It's so fucking stupid…My wife and I got married three years ago. I was just married when she started dating Brad. I knew Brad was bad news when she showed up to our first date. I had zero frame of reference for a relationship. I was a 30 year old man from the backwoods of Louisiana who got married. But then he started dating my wife, I told her and she went right into that frame of reference and now that I'm seeing Brad today and my wife is cheating, it gets even worse. My wife and I had fun and we'll do it again as soon as our relationship can handle it.\n\nOne thing I've noticed about my wife and myself are we are all kind, forgiving beings who really have an appreciation for each other's flaws. That is why I have no problem walking away on a date with my wife when she starts acting like one of her cuckolds. I love the woman I married to that. I love that she treats my wife and me well and understands our limitations. I love my wife as a person, but I would never cheat on her…I'll leave in a month if my wife doesn't have sex with me. But I do love her.\n\nShe was my best friend's college girlfriend – she and my best friend, John, are the only two guys I was ever friends with before I met Jules. Our paths would cross and my wife would talk to John and he would talk to her. We were all so happy when the boyfriend for John's mom got married. But a year after that (our wedding, not the marriage itself) there was drama with my wife and John, and John decided she could be his girlfriend. He was mad at me for doing the same thing to Jules, but if he wasn't cheating on his girlfriend it made perfect sense. At around the same time, Jules and I started dating.\n\nHe cheated on me for a long time. I lost my shit every time I saw his picture, so I decided that since he was still my friend all this time, I shouldn't let him talk crap about Jules, I was his girlfriend and I was supposed to be loyal to him, but that didn't mean I had to sit back",
    "This article is about getting used to cold so I can do work that calls for colder temperatures or worse, even when it's warm outside and raining like crazy in Atlanta today (where else would it be?).\n\nFor this reason, any time I have a weather forecast which suggests there's going to be a significant change in my climate during any given time of day, I always think \"You're nuts\" before taking action because usually what happens can't really be controlled by just keeping things the same anyway. I'm guessing you will have that perspective too.\n\nSo as I explained above, I am often thinking that things are just not gonna get measurably better no matter how many times I say something else. Sometimes I don't want these things to get measurably worse; sometimes having them improve greatly is an attractive prospect – but other times, it takes very little to make those small changes make a large difference.\n\nWhat we need to remember is that most people do feel pretty darned miserable while their daily routine goes on without being changed all that much compared the days in between. That's why we keep putting up with it: there IS still so much that's terrible out there in the world, after all! It's only a few more years until it gets over with, and THEN I'll look at this life in a totally different way! And for someone who has a lot invested in these present conditions right now, this is what makes me happy…\n\nTo prevent weather control fatigue, try to use one tool to stay comfortable where possible: your sleeping bag. Sleep bags absorb a surprisingly large amount of the incoming solar radiation, especially if they're insulated over a layer. But keep in mind the heat gain through convection, which actually keeps things cooler in cool areas than warmer ones – and not everyone wants to spend $600+ on a synthetic shell during such hot climates as Atlanta. That said, down insulation does significantly reduce the impact of external temperatures, but then again, a big percentage of us own our cars, home improvements buildings or office spaces. I'd probably buy any sort of down insulation I could find, however, rather than going for something fancy like \"R-Value 7″\", which might work well for me in certain circumstances, but for someone trying to live in the Northeast, it may provide little relief for many days anyway. Also, be sure that whatever",
    "This question has been coming up recently for me. There are two ways to answer it:\n\nBe a dick. Don't be a dick. I guess the latter is easier to say but I don't feel all that confident doing it. So what do I do? Here's a handful of tips: 1. Do whatever makes you happy, don't do whatever you're most scared of. Be honest with yourself. 2. Be yourself, you will never be more successful being someone else. 3. I use to be scared of doing things I wasn't good at but I've since realized the best way to improve is to do them repeatedly. 4. If you find yourself getting stressed easily try talking yourself back out of it. I had one stressful day and I was freaking the fuck out over it. But we quickly realized that I was stressing because I was stressing over something completely irrelevant, my weight. Oh the things I could buy! 5. When you feel anxious or you need something, take it anyway. I've never made any excuses to do things when I wanted to be productive. I just did it. 6. Avoid situations or people and do things you think you may regret later. I've learned that even things you regret will give you something valuable. 7. If you've got an impulse to run from your problems or your stress, do it. Sometimes it only gets worse as it happens. 8. If you don't feel like doing something try doing it anyways. Make it stop. If it doesn't stop run.\n\nI am the moderator of /r/learnprogramming\n\nHere are links to the original Reddit post and other related content I've found while browsing through Reddit.\n\nIn case you need a little more motivation, here's the Reddit comment thread.",

My doctor told me that it's terminal and that there is no cure for it. I am currently undergoing chemotherapy treatments which are very expensive and will continue until at least next month.

    "When I started transitioning, I knew I wasn't going to completely be able to control my sexual feelings and/or gender dysphoria. If I felt like I had a female brain in a male body, or that I had a female penis in my male body, I could find myself in a world where I wasn't really attracted to women and I couldn't even identify with the words 'woman' or 'femininity'.\n\nThis was very hard. I struggled to find someone to love and for years found a lack of companionship. Most of my friends are guys and I feel like I'm a girl trapped in a guy's body. I get the occasional guy who will notice, but the chances aren't often high.\n\nBeing cisgender isn't easy either. In a culture that values sex above all else and gender as primarily about the body and the appearance, being cisgender can be difficult if you're not into sex and gender. I am, and have always been, attracted to girls and I always will be. To me, being a queer cisgender person seems the closest thing I have to a 'normal', 'natural' way of being.\n\nI've been working hard to embrace being queer cisgender for the last decade, and I've found the process incredibly rewarding and has taught me so much about myself. I am so so lucky to live in a world where it is okay to be queer or a person with a non-binary identity. Being who I am is so, so important to me.\n\nHowever, as I get older I'm starting to think that this is going to be harder and harder and harder to do, given the increasingly high rates of suicide for older queer/transgender people. I think it's important that we talk about queer and trans youth suicide rates as a serious public health issue–especially in light of the recent death of Leelah Alcorn.\n\nI have heard a lot about suicide amongst queer youth, both from friends who have been queer and trans themselves, as well as in my research. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for queer teens.\n\nI am worried that a lack of awareness of trans issues could be affecting our ability to get the services that we need, particularly after what happened to Leelah.\n\nI want to bring the topic of trans youth suicide further into the",
    "You may have noticed that we did a big deal last week in r/subredditcancer; we made /r/bronze sub-Reddit gold after being a moderator of it for quite some time, and got it into r/all. However, one thing was bothering us all: we've posted around 30 submissions over here in this subreddit alone. What's going on?\n\nWe put a lot of effort into keeping this sub-Reddit Gold and are happy with it, but there were some redditors who were very unhappy about having something so easily accessible. We decided to investigate and discover exactly why these two things happened. If you want this information for further reference when making your own subreddits:\n\nIf your new subreddit gets too much traffic from one place, then you should probably consider building up more subs on other places if possible: http://www.reddit.com/domain/advantagestore/\", or http://www.karma-matrix.com/ and http://mattmarchas.com/ and http://www.sparklytraildesigns.com etc. It should be remembered though that each and every subreddit listed above has an extremely high level of competition as well, which will cause the submission karma here to drop drastically with each month! And while they may seem like nice places to start out, they are very very small subs, especially if they're just starting out – even 10 people are worth less than 100k total (there's a funny video explaining what this means.) The only way to counterbalance that sort of thing is by doing extra work and working your ass off for success if possible. You'll quickly realize that people here care greatly about their work though. Even if your subreddit doesn't get very popular, as long as you stick to quality content, great comments, active moderators, etc – any number of dedicated gold users can help boost it up!\n\nThat is all for now guys, wish us luck and good luck to both our sub-mods this weekend and also future mods!",
    "Here is the issue: The V Star 1100 is a dual screen phone with an AMOLED screen, so the display is not a standard one (unlike some other phones). A typical Android tablet, such as the Nexus 9 or Galaxy Note 10.1, will not get stuck in a boot loop in this device. They may get stuck in a boot loop sometimes (mostly every time you plug it in), but this is not a serious issue. It's more like \"oh well, it happens\" kind of thing. Even the Galaxy Nexus is a multi-touch device and it does not get stuck in a boot loop. That is not the case here.\n\nThe V Star 1100 runs a specific, specially designed kernel, so it gets stuck in a boot loop almost no matter which app (which is basically any app downloaded from google play) starts. There is no other way to describe it other than it got stuck, almost immediately. It got stuck just by starting the V Start (aka the V Launcher, called as such as a result of Google's own device model ID). I tried to uninstall the app by deleting it from the SD slot, and re-install it with the same results. As you can see below, it got stuck again by installing the Google Play app. This is not a problem with the phone itself, as you can see most of the time it can easily boot into custom recovery. I've tried the V Start method twice, both times it gets stuck immediately by launching the V Start.\n\nThis is the second V Star 1100 I've had, so obviously it's just a bad phone.\n\nThe most interesting thing is that it was a totally fresh phone installed in the same ROM and Gapps.

    "When I was talking to Drs about having an NBSI, I wanted to know how they felt going down and up that amount. (I'm sorry for the grammar, but it's all I could find online…) So I asked them this in a private message session with several docs, some being at the higher end of the scale and others closer to my 2cc. We were getting into the nitty-gritty as of 9/11 and got around 20 doctors involved so… The general consensus now is not good. In fact we all think your odds are better if you stop doing the thing altogether because things will get worse before they improve. This isn't like a cancer survivor who decided to start exercise or lose weight; you need regular treatments and support to make things better.\n\nMy response was simple:\n\nDr B told me that he thinks that a single dose is probably NOT the best thing to do for recovery, especially for him while on bupropion. For one I have done 3 doses already, then 5 and 4, but he feels better when starting over each time whereas most people might want the initial effects. He would really rather begin the bupropion again soon after taking the first dose since the tolerance builds fast and his brain doesn't go back to normal yet. His recommendation has been that until you really hit peak, just take 1 drop of every 2 days and wait 2-3 weeks off from anything else (and maybe start with 10mg/day – but don't increase). I had a follow up conversation last night which also didn't turn out well… I am more interested, though, in making sure that you're OK when you do stop… So basically how I plan to solve this dilemma? Do you think that someone that did 30-50mg/tid after 3 days would be fine? Or do you recommend waiting 3 weeks and stopping a \"reasonable\" amount? Any thoughts?

    "Hi All,\n\nI have been considering removing the end barb at my 4th or 5th/6th fin rot due to being concerned about an increase in fin rot and infection. I've decided to proceed as follows (you don't need a fish tank for this step):\n\n1) If there are no fins showing that show signs of fin rot- remove end barb\n\n2) Gently place end point onto a sharp paper clip / small screwdriver - make no sharp motions unless you want a scar- cut out area\n\n3) Cover up gap with clear tape or put glass cap over your fin until it hardens. You will be able pull the tape off if it becomes very soft\n\n\n5) Remove one end of barb while holding the cut piece with both hands\n\n6) Pull side of barb into new spot\n\n7) Cut clean tip to match old cut, do not cut too short. After its completely replaced you dont need to trim it down! There are usually few areas without a patch left so check each area thoroughly\n\n\nNOTE: Once we get fin rot under control and the patch has healed then there shouldn't be any fin rot again. This process can take hours or days depending on how severe it was (i'd recommend leaving it until we can cure all infections).\n\n\nPlease remember that this advice contains a few variables:- possible increased risk of fin rot is greater when you use a fin based filter water type (e.g.- bichlorate treated), also see thread #267968.- there may still be active fin rot but most fish won't seem sick like they used to, just have trouble swimming well and not necessarily swim slowly- if you decide to go through with the procedure of removing end baring and replacing it regularly you should ensure that the affected area doesn't become inflamed by other bacteria which might have spread to fill the cavity.- if your goal results in the loss of white patches on a single fin, these won't always grow back. The best example of this would be when cutting some parts of the tail off. Once done they have to grow back fully.- don't start removing or reinstalling anything in case your aquarium gets cold during removal.- don't expect any instant success, it'll look different every time. Try not to focus solely on what looks good and ignore how much",

Unfortunately, the time never seemed to stop. I know we're not all meant to work for 12 hours a day, but I did it for the opportunity, the experience, and to have a great life. Well, today was my last day — there is just no time for anything other than this. Now is for a wonderful celebration, some work relaxing, and then enjoying some time with family and friends. You should come down, just for a weekend. And while you are here, look up a good movie.\n\nI'm going to be in New York soon to attend a lot more conferences and meetings. It's what I do.

    "How's your semester going? Did your favorite class have a big impact on your life and career? I was planning on asking about your work on Reddit but decided I'd rather ask you.\n\nSo what did you do?\n\nI was a junior in college when I wrote my thesis, and I'm extremely proud of it. You can read an excerpt from my piece here and get a very rough sense of the scope – that you and I, two very different people, have the same problem in the same place that I've been struggling to solve with my own ideas and methods for 15 years.\n\nSo what did you do?\n\nMy thesis was a research paper published in a prestigious journal. I wrote the article as an exchange student in graduate school. The assignment I was given was to write a paper reviewing something that I'd spent much of my spare time on, and that had never before been written about, so many people had helped to shape it. I put together a really rough draft between classes and submitted it.\n\nHow's your semester going? Did your favorite class have a big impact on your life and career? I'm pretty sure, since you're a first year at university, that you're trying to figure out your career from scratch, which is a challenge. Do you feel like you have a lot to live up to given the degree of responsibility that comes with a Bachelor's degree, and the potential for a huge boost to your future earning power? I do. And I'm okay with it.\n\nThere's one last thing I'd like to add that I think is particularly relevant to this conversation. I'd like to ask you – who's your favorite person that you can think of? Can you think of any person that you would say has had a large impact on your life and career?\n\nYou should be so proud of yourself. You've written a very powerful dissertation! This is how you're going to graduate college! To get to this point means that all the things you have been worrying about and wishing you had spent more time on were the right things to do and your work was amazing.\n\nSo you're going to be graduating with a degree in computer science.

    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've noticed that there are some people who seem to think that it's okay for men to make jokes about rape or sexual assault. It seems like they're trying to say that it's OK for them to joke about raping women because they don't actually believe in rape. They just want to be able to laugh at something that makes them feel bad. This is wrong. Rape isn't funny. It doesn't matter what you call it, whether it's rape, sexual assault, or whatever else. If someone says something that offends you, you should respond with anger and disgust. You shouldn't have to justify yourself to anyone. But when someone says something that makes you uncomfortable, you need to take a step back and ask yourself why. Is it because they said something offensive? Or is it because they made an insensitive comment? Or is it because they were being sexist? Or is it because they didn't understand your point of view? And then you need to figure out how to deal with it. Because if you can't handle it, then you probably shouldn't be making jokes about it.\n\nThis is a very important post. The fact that so many people are still defending these types of comments shows that we as a society still have a long way to go in terms of understanding rape culture. We need to stop blaming victims and start taking responsibility for our own actions.",

    "My sister and I have been friends since elementary school when she was in third grade (I've known her from age 1). We still see each other almost everyday, but we haven't talked much since high school because of some bullshit she pulled regarding her child support. About 6 months ago while she was out shopping, she made a bunch of Facebook posts where she decided to tell me what a terrible person she was for being so mean with my daughter and giving them advice about how I could handle it better. If you're curious though, here goes:\n\n\n1) \"If you have a really young child and they are throwing tantrums do something like just drop your purse on their head or slap them.\"\n\n2) \"Do NOT get involved if they throw their bottles [the exact phrasing is unspecified] at whatever is behind grandma's dresser/living room wall.\" This was basically a list of all the things that were \"behind grandma's dresser\" / living room wall.\" My sister then went into long-winded explanation about how she would rather not get involved and that children who behave badly shouldn't be taken seriously even if they want to help us financially at this point anyway [I'm assuming there wasn't any specific timeline of time or events as she mentioned]. The final straw was after I told her mom I'd be calling the police over this she didn't call because she felt bad about what she said, asked me if I really wouldn't know anything if I knew she did bad stuff and that if I actually cared she must have done something bad before trying so hard to change our relationship(she thinks the father did something bad; I hope he doesn't think she can turn around what she says later); all that before telling me nothing.\n\n3) \"And by the way, if they keep fighting they won't stop until they break up or kill themselves.\" This was her take on getting involved without getting overly protective of people with kids and causing more problems.\n\n\nThen I figured I'll be honest and email her a few weeks back and ask a ton questions I hadn't heard anywhere else about a past situation involving my brother which was also related to our financial situation as part of why I decided I wanted out. She replied right away but had the nerve to say that yes she saw previous emails between us discussing this situation, but that since she",

    "I was always disappointed as I grew up, that you couldn't use classic Godzilla movies to have your own version of the character (Godzilla vs Kong). The most recent incarnation of this idea was with Bionicle and I was ecstatic because there we got 3 different versions all in the same game. You could build both an older Godzilla or one with a younger look like at some points Kamacuras. In fact my favorite moment from these games when using one of them together would be when my friend built the original Mothra model, then when he used his \"classic\", younger Mothra model it looked so badass for such short amount of time that i kinda forgot about having just done the older Mothra and had become absorbed into a new design. So after getting back into collecting and watching them grow over the years since then as well, not much has changed, still no real attempt to reuse some of their old designs and thus never coming close to reusing what was once more than decent. I recently discovered something else out of nowhere that made me realize how good this whole \"not trying too hard\" concept really is on this particular piece of property. Here is a pic of Kame-sennin from Toei's version of Super Godzilla standing next to a guy from Bandai showing off what they call a \"god of destruction costume mode.\" It looks kind of cool until you start to analyze it even though it is basically a modified Garou mask with an elongated jaw line making it sorta reminiscent of the early 1990's Gamera series. What bothers is that the Kame-sennin has little or no details/realism and is almost completely based only on facial features/weapons/armor/etc. There is nothing resembling the face and everything comes down closer than any other detail. While I like the effort it takes to make a suit for Bandai's version of this character, I'd like another chance because this might be possible if they tried to do something more than simply changing colors.",

    "I'm not sure if this has been asked before, but I've noticed that there are some people who have an issue with the way the game handles the \"Bett\" (bet) system in FIFA 14 Ultimate Team. The problem seems to be that they don't like how it's handled and feel that it should be changed. So here goes...\n\nIn FIFA 13, you could bet on any match between two teams. In FIFA 14, you can only bet on matches between your own team and another team. This means that if you want to bet on a match between two other teams, you need to use a third party site such as Betway or Paddy Power. If you're using these sites, then you'll see a small box at the bottom right corner of the screen which says \"Betting\". Clicking on this will take you to a page where you can enter the amount you'd like to bet. You can also choose whether you would like to place a fixed bet or a percentage bet. A fixed bet is when you simply select a number and click \"Place Bet\", while a percentage bet allows you to set a maximum bet amount. Once you've entered the amount you wish to bet, you'll be taken to a betting window where you can make your selection.\n\nIf you win the bet, you get the money back minus whatever fee was charged by the third party site. If you lose, you keep the money.\n\nSo why do some people dislike this? Well, for one thing, it makes sense. Why would you want to bet on a match between your own team and another team? It doesn't really add anything to the gameplay. But more importantly, it feels like cheating. There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to bet on a match between your own team and another team. And yet, somehow, EA Sports decided that it's okay to allow players to bet on matches between their own team and another team.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"But wait! That's just FIFA 13!\" Yes, it is. However, FIFA 14 is a completely different beast. Here's why:\n\nFIFA 14 has a new mode called Squad Battles. Squad Battles are essentially mini-games that you play against other players. They're similar to",

    "\"Hi, I'm a guy and I like hugs. I don't mind if you're a girl, but I do have some issues with girls hugging me because it's not really something that happens in real life. It's just something that they think is cute. And I know that this is probably weird for most guys, but I've noticed that there are a lot of girls who will try to get me to hug them. They'll say things like 'you look so nice' or 'it would be great if we could just hold hands.' But then I realize that these girls aren't actually trying to make friends with me, they're just trying to get me to give them a hug. So I usually just ignore them. Sometimes though, I'll end up giving one anyway. This happened recently at a party where I was hanging out with my friend. We were talking about how much fun we had last night and she said that she wanted to go home and watch TV. She asked me if I'd like to come along. I told her no, but I did want to hang out with her. She said okay, and we went back to her place. When we got there, she started kissing me on the lips. I didn't kiss back, but I wasn't going to stop her either. After a few minutes of this, she pulled away and said that she needed to use the bathroom. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that she couldn't wait any longer and that she had to pee. I asked her why she had to go, and she said that she had to go to the bathroom. I asked her again if she needed help getting into the bathroom, and she said that she didn't need anyone helping her. I asked her if she was sure, and she said yes. I helped her get into the bathroom, and as soon as she was done, she turned around and walked out of the room without saying anything else. I sat down on the couch next to her and watched TV for a while before she came back. As soon as she opened the door, she hugged me and kissed me on the mouth. I tried to pull away, but she kept holding onto me. I finally gave up and let her go. I felt bad for being such an asshole, but I also felt guilty for letting her go. I guess I should",
    "My name is ‪Alyssa who lives in San Francisco with her husband, Michael, and their two children. My husband has a serious physical disability that limits his movements; he was born with an extra pair of thumbs, which forced him into working as a cashier at TJ Maxx after college. Because of his impairment, his job requires very repetitive heavy lifting and moving around constantly -- basically, like a machine with four arms. It's difficult to get into, and even harder when you need two hands or are just starting out on your own. We're still trying hard not have expectations about what a job will be like because it seems too far away — we have both been doing it for years now without having real hopes of what it will eventually look like, no matter what jobs come along. So whenever anyone tells me to apply for a job, my husband can instantly picture why they may think this. Even though they'll go on to say all sorts of fun things about hiring new people, I don't want to get attached yet either. […] Just to give another example from an individual interview I had recently in my current work environment: a man came up to me and stated, \"I wonder how long you've been married. All I hear from moms who got divorced before me is 'thank god it had good kids'.\" My answer? \"\"You know what, sir? For now, I haven't decided what it would take. Maybe I should focus on a family first.\" That really wasn't fair and didn't help any feelings towards me personally, so he continued shouting back (which got louder) about other women who weren't lucky enough to end up single parents without the support system from home -- he called them sluts, whores, stupid bitches – whatever he thought. And I couldn't really defend myself since they were completely unrelated topics -- but let's face facts. If I applied for that male job, then I wouldn't stand much chance of getting it. This is only one case by another person's personal opinion with absolutely zero proof backing his argument (except for one story from a friend in Seattle that didn't happen either). When faced with others giving opinions based on what they choose to believe most often than not, one simply has to accept that there is often just no true answer and move on.\n\nAs Reddit suggests, this",

I know that I would have been more comfortable dating someone who was older than me (or even someone who was younger) if they were more mature and experienced.

The answer is simple: Because it's true.\n\nWe've talked about the importance of learning about sexuality early on in our blog posts, and we encourage everyone to do their own research into topics like STDs, pregnancy prevention, and other issues related to sex. However, there are times when you may need to make decisions based on information that isn't readily available. For example, if you're considering getting pregnant, you might want to consider talking to your doctor first. If you're trying to decide between two partners, you might want to consult a counselor or therapist.\n\nIf you're wondering whether you should date someone who has had sex at a young age, here are some questions to consider:\n\n1. Do you trust them?\n\nIt's important to remember that no matter how old you are, you can always trust your instincts.

    "This is a screen-shot from an image of the scan I had this morning. This is my baby's belly that has been swollen for what is probably the last 4 months. I have had it done by [redacted] three times and I'm terrified this procedure does nothing to solve her problems.\n\n(Note: This is not the ultrasound image we were trying to get)\n\nThe ultrasound tech said she \"just finished removing that.\" When she removed it, the uterus, cervix, and ovaries looked like they were all normal and intact — except that I just now discovered that I had another 8-10 weeks to go before my due date. No matter how much I wanted to push this procedure as soon as possible, I've never had a woman, in the history of ultrasound techs, tell me I can't go through with it. I had to go up there, and I guess she decided to wait 'till [redacted] gets back to me.\n\nI asked them which of her techniques they would be using here, and she said that they were going to use a transvaginal probe (see image below). I really like this method, and I didn't want them to just take a transvaginal probe and move on from there. I asked if she had any doubts about whether we would use it, and unfortunately she said yes, that her first choice was to use a rectal probe, but she couldn't because my baby isn't a rectum, and since we didn't have the resources to go that far back in the woman's uterus, she had to go with what she was told was the best bet for most of the ultrasound techs here.\n\nI asked if my baby is a uterus, and she said yes, we'll just check that out and let the technicians make sure. So I asked if they would use rectal probes, even though technically she was saying they were the best bet that would still work. She said they might, but they wouldn't. I don't want to be so freaking paranoid about one thing in this whole pregnancy, and then the next day feel like shit because there's nothing here.\n\nI feel betrayed. I mean, there really isn't evidence saying my baby isn't a uterus, but they haven't checked anything for a while.\n\nIt's been almost a month, and I've tried",
    "Since my last post the snow came in quite heavy & quickly. As of 1230 there's still about 3-4 feet of snow on the ground. I've been sitting in my truck on my driveway, and because it's cold here in the morning I didn't put in my boots, which were supposed to come off this morning. All of a sudden the truck started moving & I ended up slipping on my ankle & falling on my shin into my driveway. Luckily I didn't land on my foot and didn't break any bones & was just sore for a couple of days. It's not anything dramatic. I fell because I tried to slide out of the truck when I heard it sliding a little bit with the snow. Unfortunately my foot got caught underneath me & when I let go of the truck it fell into my driveway. The truck was parked in the middle of the front lawn with my house in the back. I was wearing hiking booties so I can't imagine the snow was heavy enough to move the trailer so easily. It's pretty easy to slide when you're moving like that on flat ground.\n\nThis afternoon I got home from work & the snow had cleared up significantly. It did make it a little sticky here in NJ and driving is a challenge due to the heavy snowfall & thick layer of ice. So I drove home in the rain & snow. Here's a picture of my car today:\n\nAnd this is my house from last night:\n\nI can't imagine trying to drive without snow boots.\n\nI've been sitting in my car on the driveway of my house all day & am exhausted now. I'm going to bed at around 3. I should awake some time in the afternoon but I'm already tired.\n\n\nPS. I've been thinking about getting some help with my truck. Hopefully there's someone who can move the snow off my driveway & clear the snow off my grass or driveways.",
    "So I went out on New Years morning for coffee and started my day off by reading reddit. Apparently \"I was pissed off\" isn't really an appropriate use of this particular word, as apparently many others have experienced it as well. To be clear: I did not find myself angry or resentful. Instead my eyes kept drifting towards whoever was next to me in line, trying to remember how many people had been sitting there just like them. No one noticed my wandering gaze or realized I'd felt annoyed at all until one person asked what I wanted. Then I made eye contact with the man closest to me and he replied, calmly but firmly, \"You.\" (Note to self: Don't try that in a work setting). So I tried it again when another fellow came up behind me because he saw someones face in front of him through his headset and thought it would be amusing if the \"eye contact\" became more hostile - then he looked away from his neighbor and raised his eyebrows suggestively which caused me to immediately go back to the table where I was already seated. Which prompted yet another discussion/compliment about the poor guy for doing his best to hide how much he was being hit on by every girl in the area while simultaneously looking very uncomfortable. Oh yeah, then I decided to take his money and spend $40 at a bar across the street... After going home and watching tv until 2am. Now I'll admit I didn't do anything out of line - the point was simply to express happiness and happiness can make things seem worse than they are. However now... after realizing just how hurtful this behavior was, something began to occur to me. I knew from research over 20 yrs ago we should NEVER give compliments that imply a lack of responsibility, or a low confidence. At one point during brunch I gave the aforementioned young lady's husband a compliment about her cute sweater and she blurted \"you're making me jealous!\" Seriously? Did no one tell these women? Or are they so insecure they think their husbands or boyfriends aren't attracted to them anymore? These weren't even a few girls in my social circle who had made light of the problem or openly acknowledged they were confused. I wasn't upset because of the behavior itself, I wanted someone who understood what was troubling and wanted to fix it because that's what I've done. But if I were talking",
    "I'm not going to go into detail about why I think this club only thing sucks, but I will say that it does suck. It's a terrible idea for a lot of reasons, but mostly because it's an awful way to run a business. The main reason is that you're essentially telling your customers that they can't have anything else. You're saying that if they want to buy something from you, they should be willing to pay more than what they would otherwise pay. That's just wrong. If you don't like paying more, then don't do it. But if you really want to make money, then you need to offer things at a price that makes sense to people who are buying them. And that means offering them something that they actually want.\n\nSo here's my suggestion: Instead of trying to force people to join clubs, try to get them to join your company instead. Offer them products or services that they'll enjoy. Then when they ask you to join their club, tell them no. They won't understand why you'd refuse to join a club that they've already paid for.\n\nAnd if you still insist on doing this, then maybe you shouldn't be in the club in the first place.",
    "\"As for the mid lane heroes, which heroes should I build first and which one to get last?\n\n\nA. Jakiro, Shadow Shaman, Beastmaster, and Invoker\n\n\nB. Necrophos, Alchemist, and Lone Druid (can choose which one to last)\n\n\nC. Dark Seer, Lifestealer, Lina (can pick whichever to last)\n\n\nD. Invoker (can pick whichever one to last)\n\n\nThe two first choices of the list are the heros that will make the most impact early on. You can then build a team around a specific core, or build to suit the needs of your entire team. I don't like picking Invoker until level 7. Just a general rule: Always choose heroes that are good on level 1.\"\n\nIt's interesting to me that no hero ranked higher than second in this poll is a strong mid hero anymore. I think it shows the difference between current meta and the \"Lone Druid\" level of play that can be found in other parts of the beta. Personally, I like Invoker better than he was after the patch, even though some other people disagree and feel he's more powerful.\n\nAlso, it's interesting to see that both Shadow Fiend and Dark Seer are among the top 3 (or 4) heroes of the mid lane. What it means is: they're all good picks, but many people are scared of picking them because they want a different lineup, but Dark Seer doesn't make the cut because he's not popular among the average player. I feel it's the same with Shadow Fiend. I think he's overrated and some people dislike him. I think he can be good, but he can also be banned out.\n\nFinally, this shows that the most popular picks in the beta are generally still good. Only Bloodseeker, Luna, and Treant Protector are outclassed in their own way. The only bad ones are Lifestealer and Invoker. It's interesting to see that the heroes that are considered \"safe\" aren't being picked that much now because it's hard to get the right lineup before level 8. I wonder what the future holds for heroes like these. But they're still good!\n\nLet me know what you think and whether you would vote for one of those choices. Any thoughts",
    "\"I am not going to say anything about this because I don't want to get into any trouble with my family and friends. But I have been reading some comments on Reddit that are saying that it's okay for Muslims to kill non-Muslims if they do something bad against Islam or Muslims. So here goes.\n\nFirst off, let me state that I'm not a Muslim. I was raised as one but I no longer practice what I learned in school. My parents were very religious and taught us that we should be good people and follow the rules. They also told us that we shouldn't drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or eat pork. We didn't even know what those things were until much later in life.\n\nSo when I heard about 9/11, I was shocked. It wasn't just an attack on America, it was an attack on our religion. The fact that so many innocent people died made me feel like I had failed them. I felt like I had let them down. And then I read the Quran and found out that there was nothing wrong with killing non-believers. In fact, it was commanded by Allah.\n\nWhen I realized that I could go back to being a good person, I decided to stop drinking alcohol, smoking, and eating pork. I stopped praying five times a day and started doing more physical exercise. I went to mosque every Friday and prayed 5 times a day. I tried to learn Arabic and study the Quran. I wanted to become a better Muslim.\n\nBut after a while, I couldn't help but think that maybe I'd done too much. Maybe I hadn't really changed at all. I thought about how hard it would be to live up to my parents' expectations. How would I ever explain to my wife why I never came home on time? What would she think of me? Would she still love me?\n\nAnd then I remembered that I was a Muslim. I knew that I had to keep trying. That I needed to make sure that I did everything right. I needed to try harder than anyone else. I needed to prove to myself that I was worthy of living up to their standards.\n\nSo I kept practicing my faith. I",
    "There's been a lot of discussion regarding the behavior of teens on social media lately -- particularly in regards to pictures being taken for the sake of being \"creepy.\" There's even been talk of teens taking photos of people to post to Facebook.\n\nI'm a teacher, and I'm very involved in our social and mental health curriculum. If a student is in a very troubled mental state, there are a number of things that can be done for the betterment of the student. These things can include a referral to a mental health clinician, a referral to other parents in a public school setting, counseling services, or even the school day could be extended until that student is better.\n\nSome of these students are doing stupid things. Some of them, however, just need to learn social skills. Social interaction is not only to be found on the Internet -- be it Facebook or Twitter, with friends, or through other social media platforms. There are ways to interact with others that have nothing to do with being \"creepy.\"\n\nSome of the students have never had a teacher who has shown them the social skills for a social interaction, who has instilled social skills into them. Some of the teens have developed social skills on their own and have not learned the value of social interaction from a teacher. The teachers at DAE don't need to be in a position to dictate which social skills each student uses. Every student, no matter their age, can develop social skills through the methods that I've shared, in the same way that all of us can learn to be a better individual.\n\nThere are some students at DAE who I have worked with who have been in school for two or more years, but as they have reached their teens, they have not learned social skills. I feel that I need to take a step back to help a handful of them realize the value of interacting with a friend. I hope that the next thing that I speak to these students to do is to call their parents to go over with them the value of having friends. We can teach each other how to interact with each other on a basic level. We can even show the potential of others.\n\nThis has come to my attention as many DAE parents. I'm writing this post to offer my thoughts and thoughts of an individual who is doing stupid things but I'm not",
    "My name is Chris, and I am a former Marine who was severely injured in Iraq. I have been told that my injuries are so severe that they will never fully heal. My left leg has been amputated below the knee, and my right leg above it. The doctors say that if I do not get surgery soon, I may lose both legs completely. They also said that I would be unable to walk or run without assistance. I've had several surgeries already, but they still haven't fixed what's wrong with me. I can barely move my arms, let alone my legs. I have no feeling down there at all. I cannot even sit up straight on my own two feet. I have lost everything I once held dear. I feel like I'm going to die every day. I know that I won't live long enough to see my family again. I want to go home, but I fear that I will never be able to. I just wish I could tell them how sorry I am. I love you guys.\n\nChris' story is heartbreaking. He is an incredibly brave man who has endured unimaginable pain and suffering. But he is also a victim of war. His injury was caused by his service in Iraq. It is impossible to imagine what it must be like to be wounded while serving your country. And yet, Chris is not alone. In fact, many veterans suffer from PTSD after their time in combat.\n\nIn addition to being a veteran himself, Chris is also a member of the Reddit community r/veterans. This subreddit is filled with stories about military members who were injured during their service. Many of these posts are heartbreaking. Some are funny. Most are heart-wrenching.\n\nBut one particular post caught our attention because it shows the devastating effects of PTSD on those who serve. Here's the post:\n\nThis post is particularly poignant because it comes from someone who served in Afghanistan. As we reported last year, more than 1,000 U.S. troops died in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. That number includes both active duty soldiers and reservists.\n\nAs we wrote then, \"the vast majority of these deaths occurred in the first six years of the war.\"\n\nAnd as we continue to report today, the toll continues to mount. According to the Department of Defense, nearly 2",
    "\"Hi, I'm 15 year old from Canada. I have a problem. I've had tons and tons of girls come onto me and just start hitting on me and saying things but I feel like I'm always \"too social\" to have relationships. I'm not sure what my problem is but it's kind of hard to find a girl that's interested in meeting up with me. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks in advance!\"\n\nAt first glance, this appears to be a case of socially awkward adolescent girls who have decided that they are in fact social but they just can't get a girl to hangout with them or get a girlfriend. Then there's the fact that, as the poster explains, there are \"tons\" and \"tons\" of girls with whom they have \"tandem interactions.\" But if it's true that they just can't find a \"girl who is interested in meeting up with them\" and that when a girl says, \"Me and the boys can't stop talking about sports and stuff,\" it's usually an indication that her boyfriend is playing with her and not dating her—and even if he was, she would be interested in her friends, not him—what is a girl to do?\n\nThere IS a shortcut, however. The OP was pretty upfront and specific about how she wants to meet girls, but the problem (as they seem to have come to call it) isn't that they aren't interested in meeting girls—it's that they aren't able to because they're socially awkward and are afraid of rejection. So the first thing you're going to need to do is acknowledge they're not just afraid of rejection or because they're not good with relationships: That's not the problem. The problem is they're afraid of rejection and afraid of commitment—and it's a very, very clear sign. To deal with this problem, start off by saying, \"I don't think this is the type of girl I would want to go out with, which means I have an excellent opportunity for you to meet some of the girls you're afraid of.\" (You say \"you\")\n\nThat's it. The rest falls into place from there—maybe you can try something else. Maybe a little flirting might be the next step—we're not 100 percent on the same",
    "I'm getting really frustrated with how the app I downloaded only works when it comes to searching for subreddits. It's supposed to work for every site. I had to make sure the app was set up for Reddit and that was a struggle to find the option.

    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I wanted to share it with you all because I think it's important for people who are struggling with their relationships and/or sex lives to know that they aren't alone. There are many people out there who have had similar experiences as me. It doesn't matter what your sexual orientation or gender identity is; we're all human beings here. We all want to feel loved and accepted by others, and sometimes we just can't find that in our current relationship. Sometimes we need to take time away from each other to figure things out. Sometimes we need to be honest about how we feel so that we can work on fixing them together. And sometimes we need to make changes to our own behavior so that we can get back into a healthy relationship. If you've ever felt like you were being treated differently than someone else in your life, then you may be experiencing some of these feelings. But don't let those feelings stop you from trying to fix whatever issues you're having. You deserve to feel loved and respected no matter what.\n\nThis is an incredibly powerful message. The author acknowledges that she needs to take time off from her partner, and that she needs to do this in order to heal. She also admits that she needs to change her behaviors in order to get back into a healthy relationship. This is a very common theme among survivors of abuse. They often need to break up with their abusers in order to heal.\n\nIn addition to acknowledging that she needs to take time off from her partner, the author also says that she wants to be able to talk openly about her feelings without feeling judged. In fact, she even goes so far as to say that she wants to be able to discuss her feelings with her partner without him judging her.\n\nShe ends her post saying that she hopes that her story will help other women who are dealing with similar situations.\n\nIf you are suffering from any kind of emotional trauma, please seek professional help.",

    "I'm currently in my second year of medical school and I've been considering switching over to pre-med for a few reasons, but mainly because I have a lot of anxiety about exams and how they will affect me. I know that there are many people who feel this way, so I thought I'd share some thoughts on it with you guys. First off, I want to say that I am not trying to be rude or anything like that. I just wanted to get an idea of what other people's experiences were. So here goes...\n\nMy first semester was pretty stressful. My parents had to move back home after my dad got laid off from his job. This meant that we had to find a new place to live quickly. We ended up moving into a small apartment complex in a very poor area of town. The rent was $700/month, which was really expensive for us. It wasn't even enough money to pay our bills. Our landlord was also extremely difficult to work with. He would constantly change the locks on our doors at night, and he wouldn't let us use the bathroom without him being present. He also refused to fix any of the leaks in the walls, despite having told us several times that he would do so. Finally, he didn't allow us to bring our own food into the building. When we asked why, he said that he couldn't afford to feed us. Needless to say, we weren't happy with our situation.\n\nAfter a couple months, we moved out of the apartment and started looking around for something more affordable. After a while, we found a house that looked nice and seemed like it could actually be livable. Unfortunately, when we showed up to sign the lease, the guy who lived there (who was also the owner) immediately called the police on us. They came to our door and arrested us both for trespassing. We spent the next two days in jail before being released on bail. We were then put under a gag order by the judge, meaning that we couldn't talk about the incident outside of court. We were also required to stay away from the property for three years.\n\nWe eventually managed to get out of jail, but we still felt terrible about the whole ordeal. We decided to try again to find somewhere cheaper than the apartment, but we were unsuccessful. Eventually, we gave up and",
    "This is a very interesting question, and I'm not sure how to answer it. The short answer is that there are no hard and fast rules about what constitutes a valid reason to be offended by something. There's also no way to know if someone else has already answered this question in their own words. So let me try to explain my reasoning here.\n\nFirst off, I want to say that I don't think that being offended is necessarily bad. It can be a good thing when used correctly. For example, I've been called out before for using the word \"cunt\" as a derogatory term against women who have sex with men. This was a mistake on my part, but I still feel like it's a valid reason to be offended. If you're offended by something, then you should probably stop doing it. But I don't think that being offended is always a bad thing. Sometimes people get upset because they were insulted, and that's fine too.\n\nSo why do some people find it offensive? Well, I'll give you two reasons. First, sometimes people use the word \"cunt\" as a slur against other groups of people. Second, sometimes people use the word \"cunt\" as a pejorative term for women who have sex with men. Both of these things are wrong. They're both hurtful, and they're both harmful. And while I understand that people may disagree with me on whether one of those things is worse than the other, I believe that the harm caused by either of them outweighs any possible benefit.\n\nNow, I realize that this isn't going to satisfy everyone. Some people will argue that the first reason is more important than the second, and that the second reason shouldn't even exist. That's fine. You can choose which one you prefer. But I hope that at least some of you will agree that the first reason is more important than the second. Because if you don't, then you're just making excuses for your own bigotry.",

To quote the title of a video I made in 2004 when Sakurajjutsu first first came off the ground:\"When was the last time anyone tried taijutsu as a whole before giving the throne?\"This post won't really make sense unless you go back to 2005 - 2010, though any discussion regarding these years probably involves many factors (some of which are now irrelevant) that impact our current situation.[10][11][12] The problem with \"Sakurasumjutsu is hard enough without all your other hobbies, it might as well be called kendo\" has been solved a bit since then, in light of recent advancements in techniques such as shinobigetsu (the Japanese-American style of Wing Chun), Hapkido (which uses kicks instead of punches).However there is this, that if people want Sakurajjutsu to die, it will die. This can be argued several ways; however I don't think it needs to because we needn't worry only long term...And please understand this post is about my life, not Sakursumjutsu itself..It appears \"People who haven't tried, gave over\", as a meme, because Sakuran jutsu is a difficult discipline without being overly complicated, easy just to start training.

    "What I understand, is that a couple of senior officers in the China and Korea departments of Japan tried to do the following: 1. To avoid the outbreak of war in a war year, they sent some Japanese troops out to the border area and just let them stay there. 2. For war to start, they said that they saw an incursion into China (because there was a Japanese man on the edge of the border), so they dispatched some troops out to the border. But because they had to hide for long time, they couldn't find a place where they could go home and go hunting in the evening. They sent their junior officers to see what could be done. The junior officers of the Japan army also saw the situation at the border. 3. They also realized that the situation was becoming more and more difficult, so they sent their junior officers to the Korean side and told them to stay there. But then the Korean junior officers didn't care and just continued to patrol the border. The commander of the Japanese army, a famous general, was told of this, and he told his staff to send their army to the border. The Korean junior officers (which used to be the Japan army) took all of the food, ammunition and medical supplies and left the area. That night, another group of junior officers, who were also junior officers of Japan army, crossed back to the Japanese side. 4. But then at about 11pm, when they were just about to go cross to the Japanese side, the Korean junior officers of Japan joined them. For the next three days, as usual, the Korean juniors of the Japan army just ignored the fact that the junior officers were at the border and simply patrolled on the Japanese side. 5. The junior officers of the Japan army finally decided to just join the Koreans and patrolled and worked in the Korean barracks together. But the junior officers of the Korean army, did not have a problem with this. And on the day of the Chinese festival for the war dead, which was on the 7th of September 1945 the junior officers of the Chinese army arrived and said they were Japanese officers and gave them a present. They also gave them an order to stay hidden for the next three days. [They] even gave them an order that they have to give their bows and swords, and in the morning they were to go home and prepare for battle.",
    "For over a month I have been trying to get my SSN and the name of my ship to the same place under separate names.\n\nI currently own a new laptop that should be shipped by the end of September and it has an EIN. There are two major shipping services through which it may be delivered. One is DHL, and the other is EMS. Both services have had significant delays and both have had issues with shipping their shipments over the last month or two, so I tried to look for somewhere to ship it. They were both in stock, so I ordered each from Alibaba, with the exception of one company who's website is inaccessible on that day. They are not available in the United States. I tried all of the following options under the \"Order a product through Alibaba from \" dropdown\" section:\n\nA) Email with the order number through a form, with shipping address and the names in both names, and the names of my laptop and the tracking number in the same email and attached. But no response.\n\nB) Send one email under the name of both names, and it is immediately answered saying that the tracking numbers are no longer being released for shipments from Alibaba.\n\nC) The company had shipped to Canada and they told me it was now in customs. I tried all that again, but unfortunately I got an email stating that I couldn't purchase from them anyway.\n\nI sent another email explaining where I got the laptop, and who I got it from, but got the same two responses.\n\nD) I finally got the answer that I have to change shipping address and other details. After more than two weeks of nothing, I got the tracking number in the mail today. Thank you for your time and help.\n\nWhen it comes to customs and shipping, a ship to a different location for each product can be somewhat of a hassle for people dealing with third-party sellers.\n\nThere are also concerns that because the seller did not include an EIN, they may not receive any revenue from orders placed through the Alibaba platform. Alibaba doesn't reveal how much money it makes selling products through its platform, but estimates vary across the web. Some say it might make $3 billion in the first 90 days",
    "We don't ban users or give them warnings for breaking our content policy but we do require those who find their way onto our platform to follow our rules and use our tools, because it's hard to distinguish the small minority of people trying to derail discussion with personal attacks from everyone else in this room. I'll repeat: We do not ban users or give them warnings for breaking our terms of service. Why? Because that kind of approach is dangerous and ultimately counter-productive to free speech — which is at its essence, about sharing diverse perspectives on important topics and making difficult choices. As one example of where you might end up treading into territory not appropriate for our community, our anti-harassment effort has so far resulted in more than half of user reports being resolved on our website itself by us not responding, instead requiring victims to file bug reports (at a much greater cost). Another example (my own experience) was recently when someone attempted to submit material claiming a certain subreddit banned them based on a claim they made about \"transphobia,\" because it explicitly allowed sexual fantasies about trans characters.[1][2] That submission got immediately removed and any subsequent submissions were deleted and the poster told to just wait for his/her inbox to tell him or her what happened. In many cases as an admin I had already done some due diligence into the poster's history before allowing direct communication with them. The same thing would have happened if the person actually reported me (or anyone else using my resources), and we'd have dealt carefully by disabling their account and reporting it.\n\nThat Reddit wouldn't handle these accusations in such a responsible fashion has sparked other complaints against the site, especially since some are blaming admins whose job is policing the site rather than policing its members. Some critics have suggested the site should adopt stronger punishment against bad behavior or start doing things like deactivated users' access after certain offenses become apparent.

    "Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Kevin Hart, Ryan Gosling, Kate Hudson, Robert De Niro\n\nDirected By: Barry Levinson\n\nReleased: Oct 11, 2011 (US) / 2014 (English)\n\nWhy is this film worth your time? The best part of \"Step Up\" it's the great acting and production value that gives you the feeling that we are really watching something special. Kevin Hart takes over the majority of the screen for this movie, a role he has had in a handful of indie films, and he does an awesome job. Kate Hudson plays his girlfriend, and she was perfect at playing a single women in her mid-twenties.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal had a great season on the set of \"True Detective\" and I'm sure he was more than thrilled when he heard that the director was picking him to fill out the roster of superstars at \"Rocky Balboa.\" After \"True Detective\" ended I would say that he was still very popular with young actors and actresses alike. Jake gets his first \"Big Screen\" break in the movie and I'm very excited for him. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is almost unrecognizable at this point, was also a nice surprise in this film.\n\nIf I was looking for the next big star turn in \"Rocky Balboa\" I would have turned my back on this. It wouldn't surprise me any more than most people did. I have been waiting for this movie since 2000.\n\nOne last thing that I didn't really get a chance to talk about but worth mentioning is the cinematography. The cinematography in this film is amazing. I love the style the director used for the movie and it really enhances the movie. This movie is more about the performances and I would rate this movie higher if a lot of the other characters were as well-cast.",

    "We begin on Endor, where Skywalker finds Chewbacca having escaped in the Millennium Falcon and has followed him through the Force to Yavin 4 with his son, Luke. There they have come across three droids who are searching for information on how to deactivate an old superweapon - the Death Star. The Emperor's plans were already leaked but now we learn about her ability to control people without them even realizing it… At least, that's what we think she can do since all those captured on Mustafar seem to be completely rational. We join Han Solo (and Luke) before he returns home with Princess Leia after saving the galaxy… Then comes the moment when the audience is waiting for - the climactic showdown between Vader and Obi-Wan and Ben and Kylo Ren. In any other film, such epic, suspenseful scenes would set the tone for another solid entry into this most beloved story line, a plot line that we at first thought had simply become cliché. However no, there was not some grand betrayal taking place here. They just went a bit too far when their plan failed the second time! This movie made me glad I stayed away from watching Jaws or any number of movies based around sharks because I'm glad to know sharks will probably stay safe from these characters soon enough! Instead you finally see Darth Vader, Vader. Not some kind of Sith Lord. What the hell does he want after destroying a city? Well, he doesn't really kill everyone himself just like in Revenge of the Sith. He sends one of the guys chasing after the ship, and another guy trying to disable the engine… Maybe he could blow up the boat (since neither guy knew anything about what was happening?) Now, how are two guys supposed to go back and get the girl and get out of there? With Luke inside... So, yes, he sends him away and Luke just goes along for the ride without thinking how crazy things have gotten. So why did he run back to help Luke?! That's right a whole bunch of stupid crap has gone down since we last saw these kids so what kind of parents would let them have sex as teenagers!? But don't worry they haven't left on that escape pod – Vader is also tracking Obi-Wan after seeing he is fighting against the evil Empire. No, seriously. Why the hell didn't Luke realize it that Obi-Wan was",
    "This film is about a group of friends who are all in their early 20s and have been living together since they were teenagers. They're all very different, but they've always had each other's backs. One day, one of them decides to leave his girlfriend and move out on his own. He finds himself alone with no money or job prospects. His friend, however, has found work as an actor and he wants him to stay at home and take care of his mother while he goes off to Hollywood. The two decide that it would be best if they could just go their separate ways. But when they get back to their apartment, they find that their landlord has moved in. This guy is not what he seems. He's actually a drug dealer who uses drugs to control people. And he's got a gun! So now they must fight this man and his gang of thugs before they become victims themselves.\n\nI'm going to start by saying that I don't think this is a good movie. It's not even a bad movie. It's just…well, it's not really a movie. It's more like a series of short stories told over the course of several days. There's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't make it any better.\n\nIt starts off well enough. We meet our main character, a young man named Jake (played by John Cusack). He's a pretty cool dude. He's smart, funny, and kind. He also happens to be gay. That's right, we're introduced to a gay character in a movie that's supposed to be about friendship between straight guys.\n\nJake gets into some trouble when he tries to sell some weed to a cop. When he refuses to pay the fine, the cop threatens to arrest him. Jake then tells the cops that he's gay. The cops aren't too happy about this revelation, so they threaten to arrest Jake again. Jake then says that he'll tell everyone else in the building that he's gay. Then he does. Everyone in the building knows that Jake is gay. Now, there's nothing wrong with being gay. In fact, it's great. But Jake isn't doing anything wrong here. He's just telling the truth.\n\nBut then things get weird. Jake's roommate, Mike (played by Michael Parks), comes up to him and asks him why he's lying",
    "The Departed was directed by Martin Scorsese with Leonardo DiCaprio starring. The film begins with a robbery at a jewelry store and is told by a gang member (DiCaprio) that this is the third robbery. It continues to a bank in the middle of the night where there is another robbery, although this time the jewelry store manager tries to stop the robbers who escape. The main protagonist, Jonah Hill plays a bank teller named Nicky Parsons who at the time, has a kid (Jared Leto) with him. It is assumed that Nicky has an alibi that night, but after a week of not getting close to him, he decides to find out whether he may the victim.\n\nThe movie is about the lives of a group of people when a bank robbery happens. There is a man named Martin Scorsese (Jonah Hill) who has left the movie world and has to take care of his brother (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a doctor in the same hospital. The main characters are also a woman who loves her husband and her son but is too tired to talk to him, the husband who loves but can't trust his wife, the son who is sick and has a secret he keeps inside of him, and the bank manager (Jared Leto). The main plot point is that if you find the right person, you may be able to catch the criminal in the middle of the film in a scene that is so dramatic that it will make you want to stop and watch it until the final minute when it actually happens. It involves a lot of gambling too that will leave you feeling tired, but you need to find both the right person and the right place.\n\nThe movie took 8 Oscar Nomination for its 10 nominations. It was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress (Jared Leto), Best Original Screenplay (Jared Leto) and Best Music (John Williams). However the movie was not nominated for Best Film and Best Director.\n\nWhat do YOU think the movie should've been nominated for? Let us know below in the comments.",
    "IMDB\n\nYou'd think an Oscar-bait film would be better than average, but Atonement manages to disappoint and underwhelm. The characters are flat; the plot is convoluted; it's almost impossible to care since our heroes come way too close to death in ways that feel like cheap tricks. In fact, the whole movie has been made into a series of tricks—not unlike those used on this train wreck. Not once do we gain insight about how this particular family wound up in these specific situations, and certainly not at the end of the film when all the plot lines seem to converge and we finally find out where the money went. On top of all the contrived plot twistery, there were no memorable performances here either. Some very well cast actors did pass muster as the supporting players, but there weren't any great moments between them and Robert DeNiro. I'm assuming his character was written so far away from humanity you wouldn't notice him—like one bad apple spoiling everyone else—but it still felt wrong even after watching all nine episodes without fail.\n\n\nThis makes the sequel, \"At All Costs,\" (2003) by Joe Berlinger, look like one huge improvement over everything before it. He took this story and pushed it to the point where it became very entertaining stuff, if slightly frustrating for fans in search of some good writing. And he also added some twists like the ones with David Copperfield doing a job, while not getting paid one bit. Plus, while there aren't many characters to love, several more did actually have great moments: Jason Patric and Patricia Clarkson were particularly strong. These two actors had both been in films just prior on the same topic, the romantic comedy \"Blue Valentine.\" So they clearly could pull off something similar. And there were other performances all over the place, especially Paul Giamatti and Morgan Freeman. But these scenes didn't really land anywhere near those we saw with John Lithgow when he played John McClane in Die Hard 3. Both movies did their fair share of action work, especially in the case of Blue Valentine, but nothing compared to what happens in this one. This was much different indeed—it was dark, gritty, intense, and pretty damn violent. It looked like a movie directed for war-on-a-spectrum types, filled with realistic scenes.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there wasn't anything",

    "This film has been compared to \"La La Land,\" but it's not quite as good, and that's because it doesn't have the same kind of soul. It's more like a musical than a musical. The story is about an old man who lives in a small town with his wife and daughter. He's retired now, but he still loves music and he wants to play one last concert. But when he gets a call from his son, he realizes that he can't go on without his beloved granddaughter. So he decides to take her out on a date. And then things get complicated.\n\nIt's hard to say what exactly makes this movie so special. I think it's the way it uses its time period. There are some great performances here, especially by Sally Hawkins (who plays the grandmother) and Octavia Spencer (who plays the young woman). But there are also some moments where you just want to put your head down and watch the scenery roll by.\n\nI'm going to give this movie 3/5 stars.",

The film also stars Colin Farrell as Albus Dumbledore, Rupert Grint as Gilderoy Lockhart, Maggie Smith as Luna Lovegood, David Thewlis as Severus Snape, Michael Gambon as Mad-Eye Moody, and Robert Pattinson as Draco Malfoy.\n\nI have seen this movie twice and I can say with confidence that it is not worth seeing unless you are a fan of Harry Potter. It's just too bad because there were so many great scenes in this movie. But if you're looking for something new to watch on your DVD player, then this might be the right choice.",

    "I know how it feels when the new season of \"Community\" starts and no, it's not enough. I never felt this way when I watched season seven of \"Community,\" an absolute mess. A whole new season of \"Family Guy,\" \"Bravo's\" best episodes, and a couple other shows were made to take its place, but the new season was just too much. Instead of keeping the spirit of the show intact, the creative team pulled the rug out from under us. A new director and writer (both of which have not been very involved in \"Community\") would not undo this debacle, and neither would the loss of four key members of the cast. This is not the kind of show you could keep going for months on end with the same production values. The new show will not even stand next to a new season of \"Family Guy.\" The whole new series looks and sounds nothing like \"Community\" in any way, and if you actually listen to the voiceovers and read the scripts, they seem very different just like the writers. In a year where \"Community\" is being canceled, \"The Simpsons Movie\" is the only new offering that I would recommend. A great number of references are made to \"Community,\" and many of the jokes are very similar to the ones we have all noticed on \"Community\" over the last few years. \"The Simpsons Movie\" isn't perfect. The characters are the same, the humor has the same feel. But the show works because of its unique style and the fact that it has a different voice. It is a comedy as the fans have known it, but with just a different voice. Some characters do not come out as funny as they have in the past, and when the fourth episode turns into a war story, even some of the show's best jokes are lost. But the film is still a fun experience because this is a different kind of episode, a dark comedy and very different from all the laughs we have come to expect from the show. The only thing better than watching \"The Simpsons Movie\" is hearing the voice of \"J.W. Smollett\" on the commentary.",

    "BlacKkKlansman is an indie film written by Matthew Modine (Hercules, The Wrestler) based on a novel about a black lawman in South Africa and his relationship with an aspiring boxer. It stars Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Forest Whitaker, and Theo James who plays the only black character in the film. The screenplay is based on a graphic novel called The Killing Joke by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. In the film, we see the main character Jules (Jordan) as a young lawman in South Africa. As we learn later, he is a former boxer who was convicted of murder. In order not to do time, he must get involved with a boxer named Trevor, who happens to be a member of the Junta.\n\nBlacK has the most unique and powerful idea to turn race relations and the black experience on its head–to not only treat the plight of blacks as a subplot among many others, but it does it in a way that makes you feel like you are participating in it. What's worse, you're not. The script goes to great lengths to show you the struggle of black South Africans but it does so by bringing you into their home environment–their inner lives–and telling you what they see when they are awake in the morning.\n\nThe dialogue in the film is hilarious. Like a great movie from the 1970s, it relies on the wordplay of the actors and does so from the point of view of one of the characters. This allows even the bad acting to work. This is a film about a world we rarely see and it relies on you being able to look past the surface to understand what is at the core.\n\nThe film is about the struggles of black people. We never see them, just hear their stories, and their experiences are depicted through their interactions with the others, the animals, and the scenery. The narrative moves back and forth between the different worlds, creating parallel narratives. The film uses the idea that this is a movie and that is why we cannot move forward until we understand it. This is also why the film does not present a very simple story, instead using various stories to further its point.\n\nThis is the definition of \"nonfiction\". It tells the story, but not in the way we've",

The story follows him as he struggles to make sense of what's happening, while trying to find some peace in the midst of this tragedy. It's an interesting premise that I found very compelling. There are many different ways you can interpret this story, but I think it would be best if you watch it without any expectations or preconceived notions. This film is not meant to be taken seriously, nor should it be. It's just a simple tale of one man's struggle to cope with the death of his wife and child.\n\nI really enjoyed watching this film because it was so unique and original. I didn't know anything about the subject matter when I first saw it, but after seeing it again, I realized how much I had missed out on. I'm glad I watched it again because I learned more about the subject matter than I ever thought possible. I also learned that there are many different interpretations of this story, which makes it even more intriguing.\n\nOverall, I give this film 4/5 stars.",

Then he makes up a drink called \"the blackberry martini.\" That's pretty awesome.\n\nAnother scene that really stood out to me was when the couple is walking down the street and they see a man with his arm around another woman. The guy looks like he's having sex with her. The girl turns around and sees him too. She walks away and then comes back and tells the guy she doesn't want to talk to him anymore. The guy gets mad and starts yelling at her. Then the girl runs off crying.\n\nOverall, this movie is definitely worth watching. It's got lots of action and it's got a lot of heart. If you're looking for a romantic comedy, this might be your movie.",
    "As much as I dislike spoilers, let me get off my soapbox regarding how Batman V Superman plays out. The narrative arc in the movie is quite amazing and quite well paced all around—that might be true if it took place over two weekends instead. So with that said…\n\n\nWhat is really impressive about Batman V Superman (besides its action sequences) is how effectively Warner Bros., the screenwriters Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, and director Zack Snyder, have balanced a great amount of humor into one cinematic experience. We get to the first surprise which ends up being the main theme of the film—not just in one scene or two but, over the course of each individual movie…the themes are recurring throughout, and they're even used in dialogue. In addition, the overall tone of the story matches everything on screen and makes you wonder, at any point in the entire thing where Batman could have gone wrong in his mission with Lex Luthor. All of this would not only have been possible as an independent project, but it actually happens all across the franchise; some fans have said that their favorite movie was only as good as where Snyder wanted it to go, and even though he couldn't directly control exactly why movies like Man of Steel were so successful, he was able to build characters who weren't the obvious villains, put them through dramatic trials through the same circumstances he'd probably be facing himself, but still make them sympathetic people. He's also succeeded at making us care for these more than just entertainment. It comes together so naturally. If any previous superhero film can claim that feat, it's likely the Marvel films of the past decade; there's nothing in those films that feels forced—especially since the filmmakers have become familiar with the material over the years, and knew exactly what audiences wanted out of their movies. There are several reasons why these films work especially well with modern viewers, one being Batman's transformation; while there may be more drastic changes between Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne and Adam West as Batman, the underlying themes feel remarkably similar whether we see him wearing a clownish bat suit or a tuxedo. For many fans, they'll simply remember all three incarnations as they saw him last, not having seen this version just yet. This was perhaps another major reason why I didn't miss the earlier days of the television series, seeing the influence they had, even though some",
    "This film is about an American astronaut who, after being stranded on Mars, decides to return home and become a pilot. The story follows his journey back to Earth as he tries to find out what happened to him and why he was left behind. It's not exactly a realistic depiction of life in space, but it does have some interesting elements that make it worth watching.\n\nI'm going to start with the positives first. This is one of those movies where you can tell that the director really wanted to do something different than most other films. He has a very unique style which I think works well for this type of movie. His cinematography is also quite good. There are many shots that look like they were taken by a professional photographer. The music is also pretty great. The soundtrack is composed by John Williams (who did the score for Star Wars) and features some of his best work ever.\n\nThere are several scenes that are just plain weird. For example, there is a scene where the astronauts are walking through a forest and suddenly a giant tree falls down right next to them. They all run away from it, but then the trees starts growing again. Then another tree falls down and they run into it. And so on. These scenes are kind of funny at first, but then you realize that they're actually supposed to be disturbing.\n\nAnother thing that makes this movie stand out is its use of special effects. Most of the time when we see these things in movies, they're either CGI or practical effects. But here, everything looks real. You can even hear the wind blowing through the trees.\n\nOverall, I would say that this is a fun movie. It's got a lot of action sequences and it's definitely worth checking out if you want to see how a sci-fi movie should be made.",
    "I'm not sure why people are mad at him, but Christopher Penn has done some rather questionable things. Whether it's cheating on his wife, cheating on his parents (yes, that whole mess with his mom and dad), or stealing money he never earned? I do understand what many angry moviegoers were hoping for when they go to see \"The Commitments,\" which finds a middle-aged couple who make their living running an investment company and doing what they think makes them happy–and getting more unhappy every day. With financial crises looming throughout South Africa, they've realized that they have no true purpose in life other than what's been provided by others; and instead of fixing this broken system with new ideas and methods, they've decided that maybe things are just going about as well as they probably should be anyway. But after their child dies, you betrayed them all over again! And now they're even angrier than ever–as if anything can get better, right? That leads into one man losing everything due to a car accident that ended up leaving one of the adults comatose because they didn't buckle their seat belt! And yet Christopher Penn does exactly those same terrible things with almost the exact result so everyone would want to run. Well, \"Christopher Penn is nothing like Chris Penn.\" It's quite shocking to say, but there were moments where he actually was likable while taking responsibility for being wrong. He wasn't one of those dicks who doesn't listen and is always stuck in his own head (see above tweet). No, it's easy to love a guy who knows how hard he worked behind the scenes while also acknowledging that sometimes this takes its toll on your heart. At least Christopher Penn understands there's something deeper at play here: It certainly looks very different watching him try and help solve that problem than it seems from watching him fight and screwing around. The only reason I couldn't leave my wife and son and pick it back up was because I could see it too few times. In my world, the main plot device to \"The Commitments\" really is it's characters rather than the performances.",
    "\"No sooner are we immersed in Shaun's world than he turns into a zombie! That was our first thought when it came to our rating because we haven't seen this exact scenario on screen before, with any film that much fun to watch. However, the fact is not all zombies have been portrayed as such in other films (see Zombieland), so to expect these undead creatures could be a problem here might not make sense. We had no problems playing along, but being able to laugh and enjoy it is what matters and we did. Plus, the cast and crew really seemed to embrace themselves more as humans by the time the end credits began.\" —Meredith Mazzolini, writer & director",

The two boys spend a lot of time together, in the same class and the same room, and it soon becomes apparent that they are very much alike; each is obsessed with his own interests and is never satisfied.\n\nIn the first scene of the movie, a boy, dressed in a striped pajamas, sits with a book, his eyes closed. The boy begins to doze and is not found until a mother comes in. Before the parents know, Richard has left the room and they quickly take the child to a hospital. When the mother asks about their child, the boy explains that he is, in fact, his brother. The brothers are separated.\n\nIn the second scene, the boy is in bed. He is still sleeping and does not wake until he is taken back to the hospital. He seems in a much better mood so he is placed in the nursery. He begins to learn the nursery language with ease, he is fascinated to learn the names of toys and he soon grows tired of being locked in his room.\n\nIn the third scene, Richard finds Thomas at work at the docks. Thomas is a boy who has just finished high school and is waiting for his senior prom; after a while, he returns to the nursery and is seen laughing loudly, which causes Richard to become worried and asks Thomas to stay with him. Thomas doesn't respond and continues learning to sail at the docks.\n\nRichard tells Thomas that he must not be left alone. Thomas argues that he is a grown up, so that is his decision and if Richard insists, then Simon can go after him.\n\nRichard enters the nursery, takes the nursery key and unlocks the doors.

    "This story may have been left out of the official trilogy, but it's just as relevant to the film and its mythology—and more than just an excuse for a monster suit. The thing that separates this from the film we've all grown up with? It features a whole group of non-human creatures called Skitters, all who are connected to another force known only as…the Tannhäuser Gate (because it would have stopped anything), and most importantly….they're not a pack of monsters. They are friends, families, strangers or partners. And they will always be there regardless of what humanity does to survive. These are people in pain like you and me, no less; human beings just on a much larger scale. They just need someone to fight by their side, who can fight just as hard for them. Don't let yourself down because The Thing isn't going to save your life on your own. Or if it does, I guess it'll make things worse somehow.

This type of representation brings up several valid points about the consequences of consuming drugs when they are legalised or not. However at no point does the film delve into such matters nor delve too far into what's happening with the real world now which would help us decide whether the drug use has a negative effect on society.

Maybe I just can't stand the idea of seeing another action flick about a guy in a suit saving people.\n\nAnyway, let me tell you what happened when I watched this movie. First off, I had no idea how to watch a movie on my computer. So I went out and bought a DVD player. Then I got a VCR. And now I've got a laptop. I guess I should be thankful that I live in such a technologically advanced society where we can watch movies on our computers instead of going to the theater.\n\nSo anyway, I started watching this movie. And I thought to myself, \"Wow! That looks pretty cool.\" And then I realized that I was actually kind of bored by the whole thing. I mean, sure, there were some cool scenes here and there, but overall, I found myself getting bored pretty quickly.\n\nAnd then I noticed something else. There are two different endings to this movie. One ending is very similar to the original Die Hard. In fact, it even ends exactly the same way. However, the other ending is completely different. Here's what it says:\n\nIn the alternate ending, the main character (Bruce Willis) escapes the building before the bomb goes off. He then makes his way through the city streets, dodging bullets as he tries to find a safe place to hide. Eventually, he finds himself face to face with a terrorist leader named Hans Gruber (Harrison Ford). As they fight, Gruber reveals that he knows the identity of the real bomber. When Bruce refuses to reveal his own name, Gruber shoots him in the head.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking.",

    "This film, directed by David Fincher (Fight Club), stars Johnny Depp as a former mobster who returns to New York City after being released from prison and finds himself in possession of a mysterious manuscript that has been stolen from him years ago. The book contains an account of his life as well as a list of people he killed during his time on the run. He also discovers that the person who stole it was none other than his old boss, Frank Costello (Depp).\n\nI have seen this movie twice now and I can say with confidence that it is one of the best movies ever made. It's not just because of its great acting or cinematography but because of how it manages to tell a story without any dialogue whatsoever. This is done through the use of flashbacks and montages which are used to show us what happened before we were introduced to the main character. In fact, the entire movie is told through these two methods.\n\nIn addition to all of this, there is a lot of symbolism going on throughout the movie. For example, when the protagonist first meets Frank Costello, he asks him if he knows where the book is. Frank replies that he does not know either. However, later on, when Frank is reading the book, he says that he knows exactly where it is. This shows that Frank is aware of the book's existence and that he knows about the murders committed by the protagonist.\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is that the protagonist is able to read the book even though he doesn't speak English. This is because the author wrote the book in Italian. This is another way that the movie makes you think about language barriers.\n\nOverall, Black Mass is a very good movie that will make you feel like you're watching something special. If you haven't seen it yet, then go ahead and watch it right away!",

    "This film has been described as a science fiction thriller, but it's more like an action-adventure with some sci-fi elements thrown in. The story follows John Travolta (played by Tom Cruise), who wakes up one morning to find himself trapped inside a computer simulation that he created. He soon discovers that his life and the lives of everyone around him are being controlled by a group of people called the Machine. They have programmed him to kill anyone who gets in their way. But when he learns that they're not human after all, he decides to escape.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and say that I think this is one of the best movies ever made.

    "Angels & Demons (2013) - Angie's first film, and the first film directed by Angie. Angie's characters have to deal with a very mysterious \"angel\" named Angel (played by Angie and written by herself); not much is known about him and there is little interaction between Angie and him. Angie shows many great emotional scenes, such as the one at the end of the film when Angel explains that he did not really need her. The film also features some of Angie's classic lines like \"there are no angels; you can never see a beautiful thing and if you do, it was not a beautiful thing\" and \"I am not a person; I am an angel\". While there are some scenes in which Angel seems manipulative, he does seem to act according to his nature, which is shown in his decision to let Angie use his power to save her. Despite its unusual themes, and some questionable plot points, Angies performance will always stay in my heart. If you like this review, please share it and comment it!",

    "\"Bastards!\" the sound of the gun fired, as the black, tattooed bodyguard's gun goes off and the two young men, both in the middle of their sex, jump out of the way. Before they realize what is happening, they will be cut down by the black-clad man with two guns. \"I killed them,\" shouts the blond, hissing man, who's pointing the guns at the black body. He is the villainous, bald, hulking man with the guns. But there can be only one Darkness. I am not a hero. I just love the dark, I love the feeling of being alive, of doing something about it, of being able to make some change.\"\n\nThe most amazing thing about \"Cross of Iron\" is the incredible, emotional performance from the lead actor, Jason Momoa. You want to run up to him and hug him just to see his smile. You are hooked from his character and everything is captured on screen. The other cast members are outstanding as well. And, it doesn't hurt that director Jason Fuchs wrote the script after his wife and production manager were killed in a motorcycle accident. So, the impact of the personal tragedy and the loss of his business partner is also included.\n\nThere's a big reason why \"Cross of Iron\" is a must-see, \"Black Mass\"-type movie. It's based on the classic novel by James White and it's directed by a movie lover herself. The director's daughter, Emily Fuchs is in the movie as well. So, it's going to be a movie that you want to watch if you love a good \"Black Mass.\"\n\nI think there is something in this movie that will give you goosebumps. The movie is filled with such great acting and acting that just captures you. We have this dark, heavy and evil villain (who is played by Darren McGavin, the most underrated and underrated actor of 2016) and we have a small story that is full of twists and turns. So, it's a movie that will entertain as well as frighten the person who is watching it. The screenplay is an underrated gem but, for my money, the main reason of why I'm calling it \"Black Mass\" is because of the ending of the movie. It's really something.\n\nI've read this book before and it",
    "\"…one of the more intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful Hollywood movies to come out of this year.\" The film seems to be struggling in its marketing strategy, going directly against a recent trend which found more and more mainstream tentpole films attempting to push their ideas onto the masses via social media. In this, it appears the film is very aware that they are not able to reach everyone, meaning, if you're unfamiliar with Captain Underpants please keep on reading because there's no avoiding the fact that if you've seen it, then you should see this one…\n\nAt the heart of Marge Gunderson (Amy Poehler) and her co-workers at the Captain Morgan bank she works at is the hope for the future. However, things spiral out of control when the global monetary system crashes leaving them without any income and in great need of financial support to stay afloat. This, combined with an unscrupulous employee named Nick Turturro (Kevin Hart), turns her into someone who does not want money in return for anything even a cup of coffee; rather, being driven by the desire to help others as a noble act. With her son Lucas (Kelsey Grammer)'s assistance she travels overseas trying to find money and people desperate to pay back some of their losses. And when she finally tracks down Nick he immediately steals her job and flees while Marge tries everything in her power to save him – to no avail. Eventually, things fall apart however for both Nick and Lucas as they learn too much about the world around them that ultimately causes both to question morality and what defines an 'A' person (in this case, his boss) for themselves.\n\nThe actors do a fantastic job of making these two extremely well drawn characters though they have an entirely different tone. While Kevin Hart does make jokes that will make your blood run cold, Amy Poehler has become a mainstay in today's comedy movie lineup thanks to having played such comedic and relatable roles for years. One may argue that her best work came in \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\", where it shows that she can bring much more than just goofiness to any given moment. This was followed up with roles such as the mother in the 2014 rom-com \"Pineapple Express\".

    "Movie Review – Hustle & Flow (2013)\n\nBy Jeff Dohrman, The Daily Dot\n\nWhat? An honest account from an actual film audience member on Hollywood bullshit! A perfect entry point into true, inside information about one of the most dishonest industries in the world. That's what this whole site is all about…telling people the truth and getting it out there to those who need to hear it. So you might be wondering if I'm just some delusional asshole with an opinion about how good Star Wars was or a bitter ass loser trying to sell his old car! NOPE!!! In fact, I am pretty excited as hell and that makes me kind of pissed off at everyone else out there who would rather sit outside their homes and watch fake television shows instead. No wonder why they are having these problems now.\n\nI like to think of myself as a good fellow movie goer but I always felt like the masses were only listening to movies in hushed voices instead of paying attention like anyone with even a shred of critical thinking would ever do…which has proven incredibly difficult lately after the current state of mainstream media becomes more and more obvious…but this is just my little fantasy so it shouldn't matter much to anybody. Not to bring drama into your article by the way, it does, but I'm going to keep this short anyway.\n\nFor starters, let's start off with some facts. Last year alone we had an unbelievable $6 billion spent on advertising across America (it's insane), which translated into more than 7 million commercial spots each. This means that every single day a bunch of corporations are telling Americans over and over again that our favorite food is delicious, that our kids can play videogames when no kid in history could, that we don't own slaves and that the rich should pay their share. Oh wait. Those aren't facts…they're lies. Also….wait...I know about Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit and all sorts of other social networks yet none of the folks who run these organizations use them and therefore probably never get any business off of them either. Yeah…not gonna lie, I kinda hate those people right now too but whatever doesn't kill us makes us stronger. It's a fact though; if you want to reach people efficiently, then stop talking crap about stuff they care about and start focusing on things that genuinely interest them.",

    "So this is it.... In \"Inception,\" it's hard not to be impressed by the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael Caine as the characters - or, you know, the way the movie itself unfolds. They even manage to make a great villain-turned-hero in Cobb. But what really makes this movie worth watching is that it is a truly entertaining action, adventure and thriller, and it's a lot of fun to watch DiCaprio and the rest of the cast goofball the most ridiculous scenarios imaginable.\n\nThe action sequences, especially, have some of the best thrills to be had on a movie screen all year. Most movies - even big budget action movies - can't even come close to including that sort of thing in their marketing efforts, so we can only look all the way back to the 1990s when \"Rocky Balboa\" was in vogue and \"Terminator 2\" was still a few steps from being good. I mean, seriously, how many times have we been watching \"Terminator 2\" since that film came out?\n\n\"Inception\" is at its best when it takes the classic \"shoot out and then find out the truth\" format, and runs with it. I won't spoil the ending, but the way it ends is perfectly satisfying so don't worry about that.\n\nThe movie is loaded with plot twists and some surprises and it doesn't waste any time getting straight to it: Nolan's movie is structured like a spy thriller. But it gets you hooked at the second it starts. The fact that it's set up this way makes it feel fresh and exciting rather than dull and predictable.\n\nIn fact, when I first saw \"Inception\" I thought Nolan might end up as the next Paul Thomas Anderson, given the similarities in tone and storytelling styles, particularly the way he plays with language and tone. Nolan is more confident than Thomas Anderson in his ability to craft a visually arresting world with a story that's easy to follow, and \"Inception\" works on all cylinders.\n\nThe story is well set up in a way that can only work when there are multiple characters all playing their parts. This movie isn't about a single individual with a single goal. The key is that you care about all the characters. No detail is overlooked, no element is left out, and characters go through their moments of anguish and",
    "This is an interesting film, and I'm not sure if it's worth watching. It has some good action scenes, but they're all pretty generic. The story is also very predictable, with the main character being a former boxer who gets involved in a drug ring that he was trying to shut down. He ends up getting killed by one of his enemies, which leads him to become a hitman. This is followed by a long flashback where we see how Rocky became a boxer, and then we get to see him fight again. There are some nice fight sequences, but they're mostly just Rocky fighting other people. The ending is also kind of lame, as Rocky is shot dead by another guy after he kills his wife. Overall, this isn't a bad movie, but it doesn't really stand out.",
    "The Dark Knight (1998) is the second film of the Christopher Nolan trilogy. This film is a direct sequel to the first Batman film in 1989. It stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine as Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman as Harvey Dent and Morgan Freeman as Alfred. However, the film is completely different in style and themes than the first one. Like Batman Begins, this film takes much more seriously the problem with Gotham as a whole. Although it was already a real problem in previous movies, this film is much more about the whole city that Batman fights within. This movie is also very dark, as it deals with a lot of serious events - such as the murder of some children in the park and Bane's attempt on Batman's life - and the consequences that they may lead to.\n\nOn the other hand, The Dark Knight is a lot more optimistic than Batman Begins, and this makes it more enjoyable for many people - especially in America. The movie is much darker and more violent, but this is balanced by a lot of happy moments and humor. It is very enjoyable for adults, as the movie doesn't bother too much with adult themes or violence. However, I would still recommend it to a lot of children, as it is still a fun and exciting adventure film.",
    "This film was released in 2002 and tells the story of a man who can predict crimes before they happen, but he must be stopped by police officers. The plot is based on the book \"Minority Report\", written by Tom Cruise. It's an interesting idea that has been done many times before, but this one takes it to another level. This movie is not only entertaining, but also very thought provoking. I think it would have been even better if it had been made into a TV series instead of a movie.\n\nI'm going to give this movie 4 out of 5 stars because it does what it sets out to do well. It's a fun watch with some great action scenes. If you're looking for something different than your typical thriller or sci-fi flick, then look no further.",

    "This film is about a man who has been in prison for 20 years and is now released on parole, but he's not free yet. He's still living with his mother, who is trying to get him back into her life. She wants him to go out and find work so that she can support herself and their two children. But he doesn't want to leave his mom behind. So he decides to take up a job as a janitor at a local high school. The job pays well enough to make it worth while, but there are some problems. One of them being that the school is run by a woman named Mrs. Smith (played by Jennifer Garner). She's a strict disciplinarian who likes to punish students for minor infractions like talking back or having an attitude. When Marshall gets caught doing something wrong, he ends up getting suspended for three days. This sets off a chain reaction of events that leads to him being fired from his job and then arrested for stealing $1,000 from the school. After spending time in jail, Marshall is finally able to return home where he finds his mother waiting for him. They have a very strained relationship, which is made worse when Marshall discovers that his father has died. His mother tries to comfort him, but Marshall just can't seem to let go of his anger towards his father.\n\nI'm going to be honest here; I didn't really care for this movie. It was pretty bad. There were several scenes that felt forced and unnecessary. For example, one scene had Marshall and his mother arguing over how much money they should spend on Christmas presents. Another scene had Marshall telling his mother that he wanted to buy her a new car because he thought it would help her cope with her grief. And another scene had Marshall telling his mother that he wanted to move out of the house because he hated it. All these scenes seemed to come out of nowhere and weren't necessary to the plot. Also, the acting wasn't great either. Most of the actors did a decent job, but none of them stood out.\n\nOverall, I think this movie was poorly written and acted. If you're looking for a good comedy, this isn't the movie for you.",

    "Synopsis: The Germans invaded and liberated Paris in 1944 after seven years of constant combat, with one hero standing by his country, trying to make new plans in 1941. This movie is about Lieutenant Colonel Charles de Gaulle (played by the French actor Jean-Louis Trintignant), who's going nuts just before his fateful decision in July 1940 to surrender Paris to Hitler. He sees an opportunity, takes advantage and gets all the stuff he wants while the city burns around him... I don't know if this film does justice to the subject matter but there is enough action here to be enjoyable as well as interesting. The story may not be 100% true but it tries its best and shows us the real man at his best with limited resources. There isn't much dialogue so you won't need help understanding what's going on nor will you feel overwhelmed by any scene or character's voice. Some might find the cast to be a bit too bland especially among those of their Jewish origin, which might have taken away something special from the original story which was so rich with color and emotion. All in all this movie tells its own story with some very good performances by every character, including the Jews. If you like war movies then give it a try! Enjoyment factor: 8/10 - Despite some clunky direction, this still has a lot of excitement packed into it. However, in order to complete them, it would definitely benefit from having stronger writing throughout.\n\n…",
    "This film comes out in two weeks and the reviews are largely positive. It seems some people have trouble making an assessment, or just can't handle it much better than what I do. I think most reviews will not make any connection between its political nature (this being China, so nothing to do with anything in America) and its story (very interesting and engaging). Well… I guess you could say that story was mostly boring for me as well, but there still isn't any real conflict at all unless you want me to compare the plot line to something which they've done before, but nothing like Lion did (or I would've made some comparison), even though we've seen this sort before. This is certainly going to get a good reception, especially because its a very ambitious production (at least compared it's budget) coming under the banner of a Hollywood studio.\n\nIt has many aspects: animals and humans alike, working alongside each other towards a common goal; the conflict between them, a kind of rivalry and struggle that is sometimes based on more traditional animal-human relations; humans fighting against their own inner fears and weaknesses while helping others through the film, but always seeking a higher purpose behind everything; the relationship between old master and apprentice who both have their own goals and aspirations after being separated at the beginning of the training. I love the idea of animals acting as a metaphor for our own human emotions, because I can relate a lot of myself as an animal to how animals feel (for example when they see a car speeding by that could crush everything and possibly kill someone, or when one of them hears his pet die and it fills him up with guilt, sadness, or anger), to how human beings often put other things above themselves. Humans are also known for being selfish, because they're able to do whatever they damn f**king want without caring about anyone else or anything, so it isn't really hard to understand why this should happen. What's harder to accept is humans having been born into that condition since birth, and therefore only feeling something special if these rare moments of happiness give us comfort while ignoring all the bad that occurs all day long. People are simply too short sighted and selfish to take that seriously. While not necessarily realistic in nature I find it humorous nonetheless that humans treat those living around them, despite their existence and survival traits, less deserving of respect. These ideas I found extremely amusing after watching",

    "This is not a film about a football star. The man is a failure. He becomes an NFL player and becomes the highest scoring defensive back in football history because he can never get the ball in his hands. He's a joke. But he'll never be a failure. That's a lesson that you learn in life. Don't let somebody else define you. That's the key. When God gave you a chance... Do It!\n\nAs you watch, keep these lessons in mind. Walk Hard doesn't tell the full, complete story. After all, he wasn't the only one being a joke. That was played out in real life: the NFL and the players, the media and the fan base. And all were shocked to the core when a hero walked off the field. The film doesn't let you forget or forgive anything. The film doesn't even pretend to.\n\nThe cast never once loses their composure and they don't let their characters' faults get in the way of the story. It's incredible that a TV series allowed them to get away with that. At least at first. After all, when the NFL and the players started to lose, the league had an idea of what was good for him. But it's not all about how they look at him, and they know that the real fans don't like him and want him out of there.\n\nCox, the only person who is able to convince the man he is still needed by the team even after they see him play all his games as a joke, comes in later in the film when it's too late to save him. And that's exactly the point. If he hadn't made the right decision at the right time, Cox probably would've been in big trouble after all these years, and the NFL would've let him walk as a real failure. But at the exact moment he realized what needed to be done, he had nothing going on.",

It's not exactly a typical science fiction film, but it does feature some interesting ideas that make it worth watching.\n\nI'm going to start by saying that this film isn't perfect.

    "MONSTERS VS ALIENS (2010) 2.5 out of 5 stars The main character is not an all-star hero. So why does this one get any support? Because he's actually really bad in his movies. And he doesn't always make the better choice - but we'll get to that when he finally gets himself together - and at least wins on the side of decency, honor, truth, justice, and the American way. When things don't go the way that you planned, remember there are two kinds of bad; there's human, whose behavior, beliefs, emotions, desires, etc., you have no control over, and then there's monster, whom no amount of wishing, or hope should ever sway your decisions.\n\n\nThe story centers around our protagonist's struggles with some unnamed evil spirit who was cast back through time centuries ago after being banished for destroying an ancient library, and thus bringing civilization to a very strange planet, much like Earth. This being had other plans as well, though. He would build up a massive army, invade mankind from another dimension, use his minions to sow chaos and mayhem among us, manipulate nations into fighting each other just so he could bring about absolute ruin - and if he cannot do it through war and conquest, perhaps by manipulating another malevolent force called a Chaos Elemental? For now, let's say most of those aren't true, and our antagonist has just a small army of mindless killers - most likely sent via space ship or interdimensional portal. We still have some sort of evil here, yes? But what is the nature of the forces which drive him - and also how can we get rid of such a threat before it arrives?\n\n\nYou can read the online movie script in Google Docs, although unfortunately some of it, particularly the ending (\"Where did he come to be?\") doesn't add anything new to my understanding of Alien lore. My main complaint was the fact that a lot of times I wished they would have gone further along with the plot development compared to the first film and kept some interesting info hidden until more dramatic scenes towards the end. Some key plot points remain unresolved...\n\n\nThe movie was really good in general, however I can understand if you feel alienated after watching only 6 minutes. So why watch that part instead of all 7 hours worth (and counting), with all of its originality, intrigue",
    "I was not disappointed with this film in terms of performance but overall I felt it to be a disappointing film as my perception of what makes a good comedy goes beyond being funny and becoming an hour long spectacle of bad jokes that get bigger, more incoherent as they go on and make no attempt at making any real sense whatsoever…and even then the plot holes are so numerous that only someone blind had a problem finding them. As if you were expecting anything in particular there is more than enough \"what just happened.\" This is like going for a walk in Venice or San Francisco and hoping to find a place where you can look up from your phone for 2 minutes and see an elephant eating a banana or doge sitting around taking pictures of his own car parked where you left it….or something like that. It's not worth stopping by such beautiful places because you want to hear one funny joke after another that is destined for future laughs. And if you have to look up to get a single picture of this movie don't bother looking anywhere else! They took shots of a cat which is the most appropriate image I would use but also shows how far off the grid these people are having some kind of post apocalyptic future for their citizens or why did we get a kitty here. I've seen more than 30 comedy shorts before, even when watching movies from a point of view other than mine I am always surprised at some stuff and some will probably never stand the test of time because I'm sure they're awful. If I ever decide to take another crack at reviewing comedies like those then I will most certainly try to approach things like this from a different angle or perhaps with a much less cynical viewpoint on life itself especially as both my girlfriend and my father know little about their history and even more recent events except that \"people seem meaner to each others on tv\" or things to be avoided at all cost because they might mean something at Thanksgiving dinner. Oh ya never mind..my girlfriend and dad hate this type of humor.\n\nIn the end I'll give it a 10 since its based loosely on the life of a very interesting man that I found extremely charismatic given it involves him doing nothing but trying to win over the love interest of the main character after two failed relationships before finally losing her and having absolutely zero luck getting back together with anybody despite using what I assume to be all the tricks in the book to try and",
    "This film has been described as a \"love letter to Appalachia.\" It's not just that it's set in the region, but also that it's about people who are trying to make their way through life and find themselves. The story follows two brothers (played by Dev Patel and John Gallagher Jr.) who have come together after losing their father to cancer. They're both struggling with their own personal demons, but they're able to connect when they realize they share something more important than money or status. Mudbound is an uplifting tale of redemption and hope.\n\nI'm going to be honest here; I didn't see this coming. I was expecting a generic western starring a white guy and his brother. But then I saw the trailer and realized that there were some real gems in there. For example, the scene where Dev Patel's character gets shot in the face while he's driving home from work is one of my favorite scenes in any movie ever. And the fact that the entire cast is black is even better.\n\nSo what did you think? Did you like the movie? Do you agree with me that it's a love letter to Appalachia?

    "\"While 'Live Free or Die Hard' may be a cheesy action movie, it's actually a good one overall. This film has action scenes that are so intense and intense I've almost lost count of the amount of times my mind has been blown by the sheer strength of action scenes.\"\n\nThis is a review of the original DVD and the Blu-ray and is written by IMDb.com Moderator Daniel L. Williams.\n\nThe original DVD was released a while ago, and I must give credit where credit is due. The story itself starts off very strong and the pacing is very enjoyable, making it a good choice for an action thriller. It is a fun set-up for the sequels we all know and love from the past few years. In fact, I think this movie could stand on its own with little to no changes if they just went into the world and had the actors and the script make it to the point they wanted and didn't try to change any things.\n\nThe rest of the movie is another story from the same director of The Insider. It's not a bad film, but it is not as good as The Insider or the series as a whole. In some regard, there is not much difference between The Insider and Live Free or Die Hard. It is good in spots, but it feels as if they have little passion to make the film any more than the original did. I love this film and I'll tell you why, but I'll avoid spoilers too. This is the reason why while there are many who were so excited for it, I have had issues with this film. I like this movie, but the final product just wasn't as good as what I expected.\n\nThe movie doesn't start out too bad, and the first act sets the scene and tells the story of James Bond and his pursuit of a terrorist mastermind who has taken control of a major weapons manufacturer. There are moments that work as action sequences and there are moments that take place at the beginning of the film that could have made it better. However, the film is not as good as it could have been in it's first act, so in many ways, it was a letdown for me.\n\nThe second act comes alive during the bank robbery where every action makes its mark. There is intense and often brutal action, but I still enjoy this film because I enjoy",

    "This film is about a woman who has been in love with her husband for years, but he suddenly leaves her and she begins to feel that something is wrong. She goes on an adventure to find him, but soon realizes that there are other women out there who have also fallen in love with their husbands. The story is told through flashbacks, which give us a glimpse into the past of the main character. It's not easy to watch this film because it's so sad, but it's worth watching if you want to see how people can fall in love with someone they don't even know anymore.\n\nI'm going to start by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. It was very well made and had some great performances. However, I think that the reason why I liked it so much is because it was a true story. There were no fake scenes or anything like that. This movie was based on real events that happened to Véronique. In fact, the whole movie was based on one day in her life. So, when I say that this movie was well-made, I mean that it was well-made as a true story.\n\nNow, let me tell you what I didn't like about this movie. First off, I thought that the ending was a little bit too abrupt. I felt that it should've ended right after the first flashback scene. But, I guess that's just my opinion. Second, I found the acting pretty bad. Most of the actors did a good job at portraying their characters, but there were a few actors who seemed to be trying too hard to make themselves look better than they actually were. For example, there was a guy named Jean-Pierre (played by Olivier Besson) who played the role of Véronique's husband. He looked like a complete idiot throughout most of the movie. And then there was another actor named Philippe (played by Vincent Cassel). He acted like a total jerk throughout most of the movie. I would've preferred to see them play opposite each other instead of playing the same character.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that are based on true stories. If you're looking for a romantic comedy, then this might not be your best choice. But, if you're looking for a true story, then this movie will definitely satisfy your craving.",
    "This film is about the financial crisis that occurred in 2008 and how it affected the world economy, but also the people who were involved in it. It's not just about Wall Street or the banks, but also the people who made them rich. The story follows two brothers, Brad Katsuyama (played by Christian Bale) and Michael Burry (played by Steve Carell), as they try to make money off their father's investment firm, Enron. They are both very smart guys, but they have no idea what they're doing. Their father was an oil man, so they know nothing about finance. But when they start making money, they realize that they can't keep up with the competition. They need to find out how to get more money out of the company, which means finding new ways to manipulate the stock market. This leads them into all kinds of trouble, including being accused of insider trading.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie because I think it has some great lessons to teach us today. First of all, we should never trust anyone who tells us that they know everything. We should always be skeptical of anything that comes from someone who claims to know everything. Secondly, if you want to make money, don't do it on your own. You need to work together with other people. Thirdly, if you want to make money, you must understand the markets.

Our rating system is based exclusively on the opinions of our readers.\n\nOne of the main reasons Zero Dark Thirty is so highly regarded is its extraordinary realism, based on the fact that the filmmakers have spent a vast amount of time on the training and operations of the CIA. They interviewed and got to know dozens of people involved in the hunt for Bin Laden and, as a result, are the best prepared to give us the most accurate account of what went wrong with the raid. The story seems designed to convey what really went on.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that while making their movie, the filmmakers actually visited Bin Laden's house so that they could film him and his men moving about the compound.\n\nZero Dark Thirty would be well served to be reviewed by someone like John le Carré because the movie's style is reminiscent of his work; the filmmakers are also the first to make use of CGI to enhance the action and characters.\n\nBut as the reviews make abundantly clear, the movie is not that great: it's a pretty good action movie, and the actors are good, but the pacing is too slow—and the end of the movie is a complete mess. There are several points in the movie where the narrative, which revolves around the hunt for Bin Laden, seems to be drifting off into its own territory.

It is now up to a group of Russian scientists played by Alec Baldwin and Bradley Cooper, an American astronaut, played by Matt Damon, to find out what happend. A film that uses many genre elements, including a NASA-type mission with some science thrown in, the main point seems to be the survival of the Russian astronauts. It is still up for debate how well this film will do over the long run because it is based on a novel.\n\nThere are some pretty cool concept pictures for \"Moon\" on the IMDb page. Here is a pic on the right of a young child on the surface on a moon tree:\n\nA picture for the moon on the left:\n\nAnd here is how the moon might look to a tourist:\n\nI don't feel that the film is too heavy handed on the science.

    "[I'll continue on with the review here. You may or may not notice a number of typos of varying severity throughout the review -- we had too much going on to try to keep things straight. I would have deleted these, but the majority of them weren't necessary to the film's message or point -- so I figured I'd let them stand.]\n\nThe film is about Michael, a young man with cancer and a wife, who goes through chemotherapy and discovers that he has no control over his cancer. Michael decides to confront all of the lies he's told his wife of the last 18 years, who has done nothing to have stopped her husband from taking his own life, and to find the truth behind the lies, and why he's gone from being so optimistic about life. Michael discovers that he is now an outsider, a 'Mr. Nobody,' and has been since childhood. He doesn't believe in himself anymore, and thus turns his back on everything. He decides to live a double life; to be an alcoholic and a person who accepts things as they are, and doesn't ask for much from life.\n\nOnce this is learned, Michael is able to let go of his 'Mr.' role, allowing him to feel free to be the man he needs to be, and the movie proceeds to show the effect that this has on him. He makes lots of friends, a relationship blossoms, and his love is real and genuine. His cancer has slowly left him, becoming manageable. He finds purpose again. He reconnects with his son and daughter. He and his wife are able to move forward with their lives.\n\nThis is the story of a man who took a stand -- and in doing so, set himself free. It's a great film. It's the real-life story of the people who made the film, and the man that his character is meant to represent.\n\n[We know we are done talking about the film; no further notes will be allowed at this time.]",
    "I am very glad that \"Silence\" will get the release treatment here in the United States, because it is an excellent movie and a very good film to start the series with. It is a film in which all hope of a decent and complete story being told comes to an end. At one point \"Silence\" starts off with a very well-known director, telling a really well-known story. This director, you might remember him – it is Martin Scorsese, who's been directing for over 20 years now, but \"Silence\" is his first (and only) script he's directed himself.\n\nThe film's plot really started off as a conventional story of a woman trying to find her lost soulmate. The story, however, is that the writer had no idea what to write, so he was asked to provide a synopsis of the story based on the idea that you know exactly what the movie will be about before actually watching it – or rather, until watching it. And thus it started. No one knew who Martin Scorsese was, but once the film was out people all over the world started praising him, saying they wished they could write something like this themselves.\n\nIt's funny to remember what it feels like to be younger – that you feel that you could write something as good, something that you really want to see and be a part of, but you can't. And we've been so close – \"Inglourious Basterds\" is the big success story of our time, you know. We were even allowed to make an animated version of that famous film. Yet all those other films – from \"The Deer Hunter,\" \"Once Upon a Time,\" \"Die Hard…I'm just not interested anymore,\" they're all doing better than us. It's the same with us: we're trying our best.\n\nOf course, I can't write this review without mentioning the actors. I can't say anything about any of them other than that I am sure they can portray the characters brilliantly and that they should be allowed to do so. The only exception is my partner in the writing, Mr. Nicolas Winding Refn, an actor from Spain with a perfect grasp of realism despite his small screen success – but I would be the first to agree that there are not enough actors from Europe or the United States to fill out this film.

    "[I]t makes its case by offering the un-subtle insight that each musician has to decide what is important in life, both the personal and political. The musical metaphor is not quite perfect, but it works—and I appreciate it enough to recommend this film even more highly than my other recommendation as well (my favorite in the entire genre). If you have yet to discover Nick Lachey or Nick Cave as writers/actors whose work speaks with an urgency that allows their songs to resonate so powerfully about their lives and loves—then this film will be right up your alley. – Matt Zoller Seitz\n\nOne must note this statement: \"It makes its [ahem…]case through offering the un-subtle insight …\" I was wondering where the reference point can be found? It occurs in an interview given late at night on the radio when he tries to convey his frustrations regarding his own lack-luster efforts throughout various endeavors with different bands. He says that one would assume that since he wrote such music professionally they wouldn't take any great issue with him putting forth any ideas without proper training…yet, this happens again later in the conversation. Another observation here is about how he's too wrapped up on performing music to get out there to engage in the most mundane (or creative) tasks for himself; he'd rather focus on his career…how naive/boring! You don't become \"one of the guys\"…to try to play guitar and sing while also being on an entertainment television show just to play a few bars of \"Pigs On The Wing.\" That might sound like someone completely disconnected from his everyday existence but when asked why he doesn't participate much with the band anymore he answers succinctly that \"there are lots of places I could go…if my heart were truly made alive\"—he sounds genuinely thrilled to actually go the distance….is this some sort of delusion?\n\nIn conclusion, it seems as if these guys do what they want—and we should enjoy every moment that they achieve it…in reality if anything the media has done much to promote them less—while still keeping us all distracted at its current state. To date, I find it very difficult to comprehend that anyone who watches TV, plays Rock Band games, enjoys live music, films documentaries, reads magazines (like Rolling Stone), etc. will feel satisfied when seeing their favourite artist appear",

    "[A] big deal. One of the most unique \"found footage\" movies to hit the theaters in the last decades, \"42,\" based on the true story of how a gang of assassins is out for revenge on a wealthy industrialist (Dwight Schultz), finds a new life when it is mistaken for a genuine biographical movie. The film has a strong following amongst fans of the world of found footage (like myself), but it's a far more entertaining film than anything else the genre has to offer. In true found footage style, we see not just the killers, but also their victims from different angles throughout the film. The scenes are shot for an impressive length of time with impressive CGI effects and were shot on location in beautiful locations around Munich.\n\nThe story isn't the only novel element that \"42\" has to offer. There was also a killer that wasn't even a killer — he just killed people. His name was Thomas Willemsen (Michael R. Lindzweig), and although he died on screen at the end of the movie, the film leaves a certain mystery that remains unanswered and brings some suspense toward the end of the film. In addition to the story, \"42\" has a nice soundtrack of music, with some of the best songs that ever made the movie world. You get a nice mix of German and American rock songs. \"Cigarettes After Sex\" by Ondi Terry and a cover of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by St. Paul & The Broken Bones complete this great soundtrack for a movie that isn't your usual found footage extravaganza.\n\nA bit of a warning before we begin, though, the movie is definitely not for the faint-of-heart: the first 30 minutes were completely scary and intense. After that it becomes pretty much \"just a crazy killer movie\" with some killer chills and an even crazier killer climax.

    "This film has been compared to \"Star Wars,\" but it's not quite as good, and that's because it doesn't have the same sense of wonder or excitement. It's more like \"Jurassic Park.\" The story is about an alien invasion that takes place on Earth in 2031. A group of scientists are trying to figure out how to stop this invasion when they discover a huge spaceship with a bunch of people inside.

For years I was on this page but not in line with this movie in my thoughts… I would sit down patiently wondering when we'd get another one like Toy Stories 1 & 2….Then in January 2008 came a new film called \"Toy Story 3…\" So you can imagine my excitement at first!! Now I have been waiting about ten years for this movie to come out!! And boy did they deliver!!! If there were any bad things which kept me from liking this the way I liked previous Toy Stories, I wonder what those could be? As soon as I saw some small character development during the opening credits; we were off and running immediately to \"Frozen.\" The entire time I felt that this film had all the qualities we expect in Pixar movies-a unique sense of humor (with an occasional pop culture reference thrown in there too), a touching relationship between characters (although the \"love story\" wasn't as good as we've known it), a smart blend of comedy and drama, terrific music, good set design (though if this looks familiar to anyone it should, it's basically Toy Story's look at the New York streets as a backdrop), excellent special effects animation, interesting action scenes featuring both children actors and puppeteers, tons(!) of special effects, and of course – wonderful songs by John Williams. This movie took many people (some of whom I respect highly) along for ride of their lives; even though the actual experience of watching this was quite emotional-in fact it felt as if you were being taken on a journey through life for a short period of time. There are so many emotions being played off of our heroines emotions throughout the course of the film that sometimes these situations didn't feel real. One particular scene really stuck with me – during his final confrontation with the main antagonist (not that he's too popular or anything) Woody goes right out his way to let the man know he won't hurt him if it comes down to it! It just shows you how brave he is! A heartwarming moment especially since the guy was clearly intent on killing the kid! I think I loved it more than I probably let on in my brief review, in large part because it never felt cheesy despite the fact that it has its share of great scenes that made up most of the movie! Even so I personally",
    "\"Dangal\" (2012) is a science-fiction, romantic tale set in the post-modernist future. The movie depicts the life of Gurbani guru Nanasaheb Phalke, a man whose life is turned upside down. Along with his young wife, Dr. Nandini, he is sent away for decades into the wilderness to live away from the people. During this time he will seek enlightenment through meditation and understanding. He comes back years later after many adventures while on a pilgrimage.\n\nPhalke returns to his beloved hometown of Hissar but is greeted by hostile elements. His son, the eldest son, has inherited the family business but has been arrested for the murder of his family. Phalke's spiritual son, Sushant, has taken over operations and the business. The elder Phalke, fearing for his own safety, tries to take his life through suicide. The two then reunite and decide to leave Hissar, with Dr. Nandinis's help and Sushant's help.\n\nWhat's interesting about Dangal, if the reviewers are correct, is not the ending but the beginning. What we have for a protagonist in India now is a man who has not been in the public eye for decades. He has not yet lost his son. His wife hasn't remarried. He has left Hissar; but he hasn't forgotten who was the cause of his own exile. I can't really think of another subject in Indian cinema who comes to mind at all as being more well known. So who is this guy? What role did he play during the dark days of the first Indian republic when he was a political prisoner?\n\nWhile all that is interesting, the film is very well shot, with a very professional approach to shooting. There is no attempt to cut the film to fit into the traditional theatrical structure. I can imagine if this film were made by an American company, they would have cut the film to fit into the \"slumming\" structure (forget about the film not earning enough to distribute it in Hollywood; no Indian company would even bother making this film) and then they would have put this story over a period where the family had moved to the US. I would bet my life and that of my family upon that.\n\nThe film's storyline and the screenplay, written",
    "\"So, yes, I get it. This movie is not a real movie. It is not going to win any awards, and not everyone is going to enjoy it. But I think it's still a good film. It is worth watching and understanding for what it is – a film about two teens being manipulated by someone, but that's really just the tip of the iceberg. It is also about the people who are around them when they are being manipulated: parents, peers, teachers, anyone involved with them. The film, I think, gives more insight into the manipulation of that manipulation and the manipulation of those manipulated.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"The other interesting thing about the film is it doesn't feel like it is trying to be realistic – it has fun pretending it is, using comedy as a distraction from portraying its true intentions. It comes up with an idea that's quite unique and it plays on the idea that teenagers are often so eager to please that you can end up making a mess out of life. Not everything in a 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' movie has to result in a disaster.\"",
    "I'm not going to lie. I came into viewing Justice League with high expectations and some degree of cynicism (having seen Batman vs. Superman, Man Of Steel and Suicide Squad, as well as countless other DC superhero movies over my years spent reading comic books). It's that last one, where most people seem to think they're getting their money's worth out of a superhero team movie without actually ever seeing one — or even being able to form realistic notions about what kinds of films and actors are capable of filling such roles. On its surface, it looks like a bunch of good ideas with nothing to say in order to create an enduring and popular franchise — unless you've been paying attention to film marketing, which generally goes this direction, anyway. As has long become our culture of consumerism for these things (\"what makes people happy? How many copies of Super Bowl ads can we fit on Netflix?\") there was enough blather running around on both sides of the debate between filmmakers Zack Snyder (Sucker Punch) and Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer), who were both set up and cast as supporting players in the story, that had me at least taking their arguments seriously.\n\nWhat could possibly be more annoying than two fans of superhero universes taking up space — one guy saying what everyone's already thinking, another saying \"and I think they all would disagree,\" making it sound as though he'd just picked up a microphone again (because yeah, Joss wrote a Buffy script!) — to argue whether you should trust the same filmmaker/writers to tell good stories rather than those telling you what the heck a hero might look like? So then it sort of got to me. Because I'm sure there will probably always come a time when a writer can't say, or vice versa, when creators have different creative visions or are creatively conflicted, and these debates and questions keep coming around despite attempts by Hollywood execs and others (like myself) to put a damper on them. We all get something when we buy into stuff. Some of that gets used by creators, some gets stolen by marketers, and some becomes the industry.\n\nSo after watching a few trailers, read some negative reviews, and finally sat down to see the credits roll I became a bit cynical. But then — I don't know if because I'm a bit lazy (\"oh, no spoilers\") or because it felt like I was going through",
    "\"When it comes to the prequels George Lucas had to balance all possible genres; fantasy, adventure and science fiction. For much of the film's running time there are characters fighting, flying or on giant robots while battling their enemies in alien arenas. As this movie draws to an end the audience can finally get away from these over the top action sequences for a change.\" The following is the first rating: 9/10 (Very Good) - the story is great but the effects are too strong making this a true 2D film not meant for 3D viewing - this film has so many cool moments without them being shown as well as the characters with CGI in all senses! So why would you watch it? You see...this was one of my favorite movies (and series) growing up...I also loved Star Wars - even though I did miss my original set - but when I found this I was able to pick it up again in one sitting.",
    "\"Inevitably, the movie is not a hit, but it's nonetheless considered a serious \"masterpiece\" when it comes out at the start of the decade. We see young Véronique in early 30's working as the clerk to a private gentleman with money to spend. \"He is extremely rich, I'm told. But I don't want that, because they're all losers\", she says. Then one day he asks her to help him, so she agrees. He brings her to see the daughter of his friend and offers her to take care of her daughter. It's the same friend's granddaughter, who lives in a big house. Véronique is about to take the girl to her house when she hears that the granddaughter is about to visit the family in their country house, which is the biggest in the whole of France.\n\nThe two are to travel together on the same train for a week, and one day they discover the house to be abandoned. \"I don't want to look at that place ever again\", Véronique decides, and without thinking about it she goes to the family's garden where, without so much as a glance, she decides to take the girl. She is caught by three policemen on her way to the family's home, and a nasty squabble begins over who should take the girl.\n\n\"The woman was only looking for a boy. The poor boy is now all alone and sad\", the police officers say, not able to understand which one of them should take the girl. When all is said and done, the little boy who had lost much from birth is still a little orphan. The movie makes you feel sorry for the boy: she'll change his life. And then she gets caught again, and a second time, and her life is ruined. The poor girl is abandoned, and there is no one to look after her. When the boy reaches the home of the girl's family, the family looks as if they had been attacked by a wolf-like monster.\n\nThere is a film version available, which has an amazing ending. The girl is rescued and the rich man offers to buy her. He is furious, angry, and wants to kill the woman who left him for such a worthless little thing!

    "So, what's really going on? Let's just say that this film — even if it was indeed made after World War II — could end up being one of the best movies about an intelligence agency — at least judging by its trailer. This year's Best Picture Oscar race takes some unusual twists and turns. The first Oscar I can think of is Best Actress (for Natalie Portman), which isn't entirely without precedent in Oscar history. In 1956, Bette Davis's performance as Rosemary Quayle helped usher into existence the genre-bending psychological drama \"Rosemary's Baby.\" It also sparked a whole other subgenre that is perhaps still alive yet largely unrecognized — those kinds of suspenseful dramas with no moral center or clear agenda, but which take place inside secret organizations such as the Secret Service, CIA and NSA, like \"Mission: Impossible III,\" of \"A Beautiful Mind\" or \"Lincoln\" (which both came closest to having any kind of point).\n\nHere, we're entering uncharted territory. Here, we have a spy thriller set during the Cold War where our hero doesn't know whether he should be playing right wing sympathizer or communist terrorist, or something else altogether — it may never be clear!\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg and his writers do seem to do their research, building upon sources that are both legitimate and highly dubious to tell us about the origins of Dr. Henry Jekyll (the main character) and Mr. Hyde (an agent trying desperately to get back in the good graces of the world's most powerful people through blackmail and lies.) They're clearly paying attention to historical events that we don't necessarily want to consider, though they're certainly plausible enough. But while reading and watching the film, you can't help but wonder whether an author actually tried to figure out how to make a true Cold War espionage story by using actual documents — since otherwise they couldn't possibly've come to the conclusions they did, because they obviously weren't asked to do so. For example, one question I asked myself was if they would have decided to use this real-life document or even a different real-life document about who were the two \"Jecrods\" (or was it six?) and why wasn't it used instead?:\n\nDid you ever expect an accurate depiction of Cold War era counterintelligence in \"Quantum?\" Why/why not?",
    "I was very nervous about seeing this in theaters as I've never seen a horror flick involving real animals before and had no idea how they would look, react, or speak. The opening scene shows two male African American lions, named Tazza (Miles Luna) and Lassie (Travis Willingham), hunting and killing one another while being filmed by an unidentified cameraman. After killing their prey they sit down to rest but are awoken by strange sounds coming from their enclosure; noises that they recognize as human voices. Then some men enter the enclosure, presumably acting on behalf of their employer who wants the film shot but fears it won't be approved. Instead of shooting at them, they decide to sneak within their enclosure without showing them their faces. Soon after there's a knock on the door where they see that a new team has appeared: three naked guys in cowboy hats.\n\nAfter the men have done most of what is expected of them in their first few minutes, they leave once more only to reenter when the actors start talking about their jobs in ways they couldn't possibly know (which they did not mention during filming). While discussing their employers' demands, the men are interrupted by a new arrival in the house through the front door; one James 'Cameron' Singer (Willow Smith, whose character was played here by David Boreanaz). He offers them the job to go into his home and take care of him while he has a heart attack and dies. A man is also sitting outside of the room watching this process unfold, clearly concerned about the whole thing. Meanwhile the camera keeps moving back and forth along its tracking shots toward a small window until suddenly Cameron goes limp. This reveals him to be a ghost actor hired via a special effect called the Nuyorican ghost effect; a form of stop-motion animation with which filmmakers can animate and shoot live action characters. Once he's out of action his body rotates around him and eventually begins twitching, writhing and moving all over the place; although that last movement will become important later.\n\nWhen the ghost actor starts speaking those words that we think are coming from the ghostly Cameron—words like \"Help,\" \"Come on\" etc.—they sound like someone saying \"Don't let us die\" from \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.\" It becomes obvious in a matter of seconds that nobody could be",
    "The witch-hunt in Salem, Massachusetts was carried on with fear and malice, and for almost one hundred years no person was convicted. Many more were tortured in prisons without hope of freedom again. This story follows them up until 1720 when William Baum's little child died on the floor after having been burned alive, perhaps by being staked so deeply to another tree that it broke her neck. Her body never left the spot; she was buried like her brother beside her father's grave just outside town. With two brothers murdered and mother missing, an uncle brought his son over to England to help settle down in what would become America. When a girl he had known since childhood began to speak with strange powers, the boy decided to take her with him to warn King James about the witches. From this point they fled to France where they built a secret society called the Circle - a group of brave witches who would save Britain and create a new religion and civilization free away from Christian influence. However, there were still those in power opposed to them. On March 25th 1692, King Charles I imprisoned the members of the circle and executed some of its leaders in accordance with the law. There are conflicting stories as to how William Baum escaped the massacre. Some say he went inside his family's house which was later burnt and burnt to ash. Others believe he made himself invisible until all the villagers were dead and then killed any onlookers. Even if he could have simply walked right out at the front door, it would have taken much longer than half night before anyone noticed someone hiding behind the chimney so that would be unlikely. This theory certainly explains why he did not go back into the house for many months in order to get rid of a corpse, or why the blood on the windows would only be seen when Baum went on stage to entertain audiences afterwards rather than by walking from behind the fireplace. What really happened, however, lies beyond imagination. The most amazing part of this book can't ever be explained. Baum was found unconscious in the garden, lying against an oak tree, covered in dirt, suffering a number of broken ribs because Baum, while trapped under a fall, used something to break them as his lungs were flooded with air. By the time rescue workers got to him they believed he might die and they rushed him to Holy Cross Hospital but a doctor advised immediately transporting him to London, fearing Baum would",
    "I know that the \"Jurassic Park\" series is loved by so many, and I'm sure it will be remembered with fondness for years to come. However, this film was really quite disappointing. Yes there were some brilliant sequences in here, particularly when Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) became a dromaeosaur, but I felt a fair amount of disappointment in terms of overall story development. It all seemed contrived, predictable and rushed. Of course, it's not impossible to have one great action sequence, especially with such an impressive cast, but this felt just a touch too polished and self-serving at times; whereas they failed to show enough emotion or emotional journey during the film. There were soooooooooooo much CGI throughout this film…all of which looked rather sloppy! And these shots look like they might almost be photoshopped? Well let me tell you, I could go on forever comparing this film to the original \"Indiana Jones.\" While I did feel sorry for Indiana after his near-death experience, the CGI scene looked terrible. Plus, of course, we finally got rid of Pizarro who had been around since the first film and now it actually looks pretty cool! The dinosaurs are very well done in their new CGI appearances, however, we saw them mostly in scenes in front of paleontologists, such as Toht (Cladosel), where we see the animals up close yet again - which is good because the animators are still working it into every shot, even during the fight scenes!! As time went on though, and we got back down in speed mode and continued on our journey through Jurassic Park, there was no real progression whatsoever. We get a few great moments with the characters in the first half of the film (Mightily (Sam Neill), Janet (Sylvia Hoeks)), followed quickly by what feels like a dead end in the second half of this film. Oh yeah, a surprise ending, eh?!?! Sure, it added another layer to the entire 'dinosaur kingdom,' and it meant that there were more surprises to uncover through this, yet somehow, it just didn't seem worthy to me. So yeah, this franchise has a lot going for it at this point, but once again, Jurassic Park III is a classic in its own right and deserves all five star reviews from us. It's hard to say,",

    "The Untouchables stars Jean Dujardin and Robert Duvall as former NYPD officers turned CIA agents. The former are sent to find the former, who is working in the field as a war photographer. This time their mission is to find out how they got back together in the first place? Who is he? What crimes did they commit, and why did they do it? They try to bring him to justice. However, while they are on the trail of their former friend, they soon discover that they are being stalked by another former pal.\n\nIt is a great film. The characters are interesting. The director knows what it is he wants to do. It has great performances. It is well-balanced, with good action sequences and believable dialogue. The screenplay of the movie deals with a few themes of how the intelligence agencies have evolved and changed through the years, and it plays well in every scene. This is the first time I've seen the movie, but it looks and sounds like the perfect project to start learning about the intelligence agencies for me.\n\nWhy haven't I seen this before?\n\nI think it's not as well-known as some of the James Bond films, which is one of the reasons why it looks so good. In the Bond franchise, Bond starts with a mission to find a guy who is responsible for three deaths of MI6 agents: Jaws, M in Berlin, and Mr. White, who blew his cover as a spy and stole from MI6. Bond tries to bring this guy to justice.\n\nThe Untouchables, by contrast in its title and other aspects of the movie, does not start as Bond's mission to locate \"the\" guy. The first two scenes are not as interesting as \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" or \"Licence to Kill\" because we already see them played out, and the audience should be drawn in the beginning while the story is still fresh. In fact, by the time we get to be introduced to James Bond and Morgan Freeman (no spoilers, I promise), the beginning of the movie is over, as the storyline changes to the point where you don't want it to be over at all. In other words, this movie is less about the mission to find the guy and more about how Bond and the other characters get involved in an assassination plot and what their respective allegiances end",
    "\"A classic sword and sorcery epic that's dark, brutal, and full of great action. Although there's some dark themes in the main story, I prefer the lighter elements and humor of the characters. There are a lot of characters that the viewer needs to pay attention to:\n\nBeowulf: The most important character because he's the main hero of this epic. While the plot is full of action, you're stuck with Beowulf most of the time, since you're watching another man in a huge battle in the middle of nowhere (Norse). There is a lot more to the story than the main character, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nGrendel: Grendel, the king of the giants, is the only person you see in the movie that isn't evil. He's also the only person you care about. He's just a man who loves his family, who tries to protect them, and tries to live life with a small amount of excitement. Grendel is very complex. He's a good person who tries to do the right thing, but who also often abuses his power, especially when it comes to love.\n\nJormungand: The king of the trolls, this brute has the ability to turn people into animals, but he also has a powerful, unquenchable greed. He's the type of person you'd want to beat up when a fight breaks out, because he's not about to hesitate to attack someone. He's definitely a force to be reckoned with.\n\nHrungnir: For some reason, this giant is the only non-monster who is brave enough to get into the middle of the fight and defend the human soldiers. He's a good example of the type of guy you don't want to have to protect you in a fight, as there's no way he'll keep your back when a fight breaks out. If anything, you'd be more sure to need his help.\n\nErend: The king of the elves, Erend is the kind of guy you'd want to have as your friend. He has a good heart, but can be really arrogant, even when he's wrong. He's also a good-hearted, but rather inexperienced guy who gets into a lot of trouble.

    "This film is based on the true story of William Wallace, who was killed by Scottish forces in 1066 and his son, Robert the Bruce, became king of Scotland after defeating the English at Bannockburn. The film follows the life of Robert the Bruce as he leads an uprising against the English and eventually becomes the first monarch of Scotland.\n\nI have to admit that I am not a huge fan of historical movies. They are usually too long and boring. But this one has some interesting things going for it. It's set during the time of the Norman Conquest and focuses on the events leading up to the battle of Bannockburn. There are also some interesting characters such as the Earl of Angus (played by Tom Hardy) and the Earl of Mar (played by Cillian Murphy).\n\nThere were two other reviews for the movie on IMDb.com. One said that the movie was good but had some problems with its pacing. Another reviewer said that the movie was very well made and that it was worth watching.\n\nSo what do you think? Do you like the movie or did you find any flaws in it? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below!",
    "This film is about two soldiers who are sent to Afghanistan in order to fight against the Taliban, but they soon find themselves fighting each other as well. The story follows their journey and how they deal with the problems that arise along the way. It's an interesting story because it shows how war affects people on both sides of the conflict. This film has some great action scenes and also has some very good character development. I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone looking for something different than what you've seen before.",

    "The Hateful Eight is a Western inspired, if not inspired by, \"Gone With the Wind.\" It is a tense and action packed story that is equal parts thrilling and brutal. The film is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and his writing partners Daniel Day Lewis and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\n\nI have seen this movie three times now and it is definitely the most interesting and surprising movie I have seen this year. In all honesty (and I would be lying if I said I didn't really enjoy it before) I was looking forward to it because I was really interested in how well the two western actors could do. So far I have seen two performances by Daniel Day Lewis: the first time he played Billy the Kid in \"The Last of the Mohicans and the second time he played Sheriff Clix and a Mexican general in \"Django Unchained\". The movie itself is very \"Western\" with an almost western feel to it and I like it. But not for what I expected.\n\n\nHere's a summary of about my feelings about this interesting movie. There is a lot of action and some bloody scenes. It is not without tension. The violence is good, but doesn't bring much drama to the picture. But the most impressive thing is how this movie, in the last third of the movie, builds up a very believable murder/heist plot, which was a breath of fresh air because it wasn't the typical Western \"the bad guys get to kill the good guys and the good guys get to stay alive\" plot of most Westerns. The story of this movie is very tense and is the greatest thing I have been looking for in a western.\n\n\nI give this film 4 of 5 stars.\n\nClick to expand...",

With the help of two other fishermen known just as the 'Wisdom Fish' we follow them for over 500 miles through grizzly bear country while getting to know Sawyer who has decided he wants to live like everyone else. During a storm where he thinks it's safe to pass up an opportunity that could possibly change his life forever on the side of all animals is what gives the film so much character, passion and charm. There was not a moment I did not laugh, smile, cry and fall in love with this movie. The performances all come through loud and clear while also staying true to the script. This movie had me hooked throughout the entire viewing and every scene it was there.

I didn't love every single scene or even most scenes, but there were definitely some scenes that I enjoyed more than others. One thing that I did enjoy was when the character played by Tom Hanks' character, Winston Churchill, talks about how he would have been proud if he could have seen his son grow up. That was one of those moments that made me laugh out loud. Another moment that I found funny was when the character played by Hugh Grant's character, George Smiley, says something along the lines of \"You're a good boy, you're a good boy.\" I laughed at that too.\n\nAnother thing that I enjoyed was when the character played by Michael Fassbender's character, Tony Blair, tells the audience that they should vote for him because he's a nice guy. I thought that was pretty clever. I also thought that was pretty clever when the character played by Benedict Cumberbatch's character, Alan Turing, said something along the lines of \"It's time we stopped pretending that computers don't exist.\" Those",

    "This film has been compared to \"Avengers,\" but it's not quite like that. It's more like \"Iron Man.\" The story is about an ordinary man who, after being injured in battle, finds himself transformed into a superhero and must fight against his own inner demons as he tries to save the world. This is a very different kind of superhero movie than you've seen before. There are no superpowers or special abilities here; this is just a guy with a lot of anger issues trying to do good. And while there are some great action sequences, they're all pretty much set-pieces. The only real character development comes when we learn what happened to Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) after he was shot by Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He's still recovering from his injuries, so he spends most of the time on the sidelines. But he does have one moment where he shows some emotion, which is really nice. I'm glad Marvel decided to make this movie without any superheroes. They could have easily made a big deal out of Iron Man's powers, but instead they let him be a normal person. That's a refreshing change.\n\nI think this is a fair assessment. While the plot is similar to \"Avengers,\" the characters are completely different. In fact, the two movies are almost entirely different. For example, in \"Avengers,\" Tony Stark is a billionaire playboy who gets hurt in battle and becomes a superhero. In \"The Avengers,\" Tony Stark is a billionaire playboy who gets hurt in battle and becomes a superhero. In both cases, the hero is a rich white male. In \"The Avengers,\" the villain is a black woman named Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), who is also a former spy. She's played by Samuel L. Jackson, who is a bit of a comic relief in the movie.\n\nIn addition, the villains in \"The Avengers\" are far less interesting than those in \"Iron Man.\" The main bad guys in \"Iron Man\" were the Mandarin and Aldrich Killian (James Badge Dale), who were both evil geniuses who wanted to take over the world. In \"The Avengers,\" the main bad guys are Ultron (voiced by James Spader) and the Grandmaster (Benedict Cumberbatch), who are both evil geniuses who want to take over the world. Both villains",
    "After an incident which saw his father, King Louis VI, killed in battle and then later crowned king himself, Edward 'The Confessor' is now known as The Man Out Of Time, and so he takes on kings all over Europe in a bid to win back the throne (though not before destroying one in the process, ironically with his mother by his side)… The film starts off very slow- going through each of the main characters individually, taking us into their childhood until we get to the time when these three guys had become king before they got hitched and having kids together after that point. There are really no true character moments in this version because none of the events in the story have much impact on anyone other than Edward himself and it feels like it's supposed be one long monologue but I would call it simply just good viewing even if it isn't your cup o' tea but the writing felt like Edward was talking directly about me when I watched the entire thing (as opposed to another king who wasn't in attendance). There were some pretty cool bits though in this version because the setting itself felt more authentic as there are loads of castles, for example being held by various warlords, along with knights, soldiers etc and in this version there were actual things happening on screen at any given moment rather than just flashbacks or what have you…. Overall an above average movie if nothing else. Maybe not for everyone but it will be a lot of fun to watch in my opinion and as a bonus to this I took my copy of the book \"Edward 'The Confessor' II\" which has a whole bunch of different versions of events down to give you a more detailed overview (so you can decide in advance which way you feel about him): http://en2qabebooks3.blogspot.se/...",

    "\"In all of the Star Wars movies, there aren't many moments of horror that are as unforgettable as the scene that takes place in this movie, because it's a great example of what really scary horror is all about. The scenes of the movie can be used to scare you, to move you to action, to fill up your head with fear, but the most important reason is that one of the most recognizable moments in the entire franchise has been used, and really, without it, the movies never could have become what they are today. The scenes that occur in this film are great to look at, with a lot of blood and gore, but the main reason that people love the movie so much is because of the special effects. We've talked about the fact that these effects are not the best possible looking ones, and that it does not make up for that fact, but what is missing, and what makes the movie so creepy, is that it actually is a special effects based movie. This movie didn't have to be based on a special effects movie. This movie could have had an action based story, but it could have been a great horror movie and still have stayed true to special effect, so people could still empathize with it. This is the special effects that makes this movie so damn unique and what you get is horror, pure and simple. If you don't like it, you need to look at a different movie. If you like it - great.\"",

    "There were many horror films I thought had potential, but none could measure up to The Evil Dead when it came out in 1981. In a time period rife with zombie and supernatural terror flicks, the world's pre-eminent Ash character was something truly unique. Sure, he might have appeared at midnight on Saturday Night Live – and even that joke wasn't as bad as some TV shows are nowadays. But did Bill Murray really wear a tattered army uniform (or even one like Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger?) And did James Remar appear to help a small town doctor stop being possessed by evil spirits? Nope! Ash and his buddies weren't just any old guys that happened to wander into a haunted house, kickin' butt and kicking undead ass; they lived their whole lives in a haunted house… and they were THE evil haunted house. They didn't just need a quick lesson on how not to touch your girlfriend while she's sleeping, they needed an entire course in not touching at all. Their mission was to destroy every last human soul in the woods surrounding the abandoned Ash mansion, which meant killing all of them in the process. In some ways, the film reminded me of classic Friday the 13th as well as Halloween itself. So yes, I love The Evil Dead even though it has seen better days on both scores. It deserves much further study thanks to its inventive sense of humor and its compelling story featuring classic action and humor. I highly recommend anyone who's ever wanted to fight with Ash and be a walking weapon against any monsters you may end up facing (after you run over a tree limb and smash another limb), watch this and learn right there why so many people swear The Evil dead was THE best slasher to hit theaters in 1981.

    "Hollywood, CA – Pitch Black's third (and biggest) outing has delivered enough jaw-dropping action sequences to keep you on your toes but it also leaves some things unsaid and unanswered during the long chase sequence that ultimately ends with an unfortunate explosion. For anyone wondering if the movie had been oversold or was a total disappointment it should be noted that none of a sudden did we have a happy ending. While there is some good things going on in this latest entry in the franchise the question might still linger if you just put it out of your mind at last month's Comic Con but with an August release date looming we're not sure how much more can possibly go wrong. In an attempt to move past all of those other complaints we thought to ask our reviewers what they really thought about the new film. It seems we didn't hear too loud and clear from their comments so here are our thoughts on why people love horror films even if most of them make you wanna puke.",

This story really reminds me of my own parenting struggles growing up, and it might help explain some of the things I struggle to see and understand — and that sometimes drive me nuts (most noticeably in family situations). In this case, the title character plays a pivotal role in supporting his wife's decision to not have children…but the whole plot hinges on him keeping his wife alive long enough to make the birth possible...I guess we should get one thing out of the way right here: we all know that babies can be cute, silly, or just nice–and sometimes they're even fun…but at the same time they also represent a serious commitment that will make lots of people suffer very much when you leave them alone, especially if there aren't other living humans around…\n\n(Note: No Ratings Yet)",

    "[From IMDb] Call Me by Your Name (2017, written and directed by Armando Iannucci) is an incredibly exciting and thought-provoking coming-of-age film that takes us into the private world of a 15-year-old Italian teenager named Elio. As a way to honor his father's wish that their son be independent and have the freedom to make his own decisions, Elio's parents arrange his marriage to the daughter of his Italian best friend Giovanni, but things take a turn after a school dance when Elio's relationship with Giovanni is quickly discovered. While a series of unfortunate events and a terrible accident later pushes Elio toward the brink of madness, the filmmakers, along with his parents, are all there in the audience experience to help him fight his self-destructive thoughts, feelings, and actions.\n\nThis movie was reviewed on December 10th, 2017 by theScore's Chris Nashawaty.

    "This film has been compared to \"Star Wars,\" but it's not quite as good, and that's because it doesn't have the same sense of humor or heart. It's also more serious than most superhero movies, which makes it feel like a less-than-perfect adaptation of Marvel Comics' comic book characters. But if you're looking for an entertaining action flick with some great special effects, this one will do just fine. The story follows four young people who are recruited by the government to fight in a war against a race of aliens called the Skrulls. They must use their powers to defeat them, but they soon discover that there are other races on Earth besides humans. This is a fun adventure movie that features plenty of explosions and lots of action. There are some funny moments too, including when Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) accidentally turns into a frog while fighting the Skrulls.\n\nI'm going to give this movie 3 out of 5 stars. I think it's a pretty decent movie, but it does lack something that made the original \"Spider-Man\" so successful. That was the humor. If you want a comedy, then go watch \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\" If you want a superhero movie, then go see \"X-Men.\"",
    "This film is about a group of soldiers who are sent to Vietnam in order to fight against the Viet Cong, but soon find themselves fighting each other as well. The story follows the lives of three men, Corporal Kilgore (Brad Pitt), Private First Class MacMillan (Morgan Freeman) and Private Second Lieutenant Hartman (James Caan). They all have their own reasons for being there, but they eventually come together to form one unit that will go on to become known as the 'Devils Brigade'. This is a very interesting film because it shows how war can be fought without killing people. It also shows how the human mind can be manipulated by fear and hatred. I think this film would make an excellent movie for anyone interested in military history or psychology.\n\nI'm not sure if you've seen this movie before, but it's definitely worth checking out.

The script is fantastic and the script by Nick Spencer is great. It's so different. Everybody knows who they are and what they do and all of it is really cool. The plot is so good and it's so different. We don't know who the killer is, and no one is quite sure who is the one. It's a perfect film.\n\nWell, there is more in this review! It goes from bad, to terrible and to just awful. What is the big catch with Gone Baby Gone? I don't know. It says it best about this film.

If you like your rom-coms to be lighthearted and sweet, then this is definitely the one for you.\n\nIf you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself a favor and watch it right away. You won't regret it.",

    "Written, Directed and Produced by Michael Arndt, based on his novel of the same title with original music by Jon Brion of The J. Geils Band (Barefoot Contessa); stars Jennifer Aniston; John Lithgow & Jason Schwartzman as two couples who meet when meeting at a bar on Valentine's Day:\n\nThis is the story my husband and I have wanted to tell since we first read it in high school – told beautifully and honestly through the words of Jason Schwartzman's character Josh Lytton. Josh loves his girlfriend but has always been jealous of her boyfriend Chris. When they go out for dinner together after college he tells himself that if only Chris weren't so perfect he could fall in love with him. In this classic breakup comedy from Michael Arndt the idea of looking up and seeing her perfect face staring back at you becomes even more powerful than you might expect. It is the type of heart pounding emotional drama I will always look forward to revisiting.\n\nIn an interview with Indie Wire, Michael Arndt commented about the film:\n\nI hope the audience will just be so caught up in the emotion,\" he said. \"It's very easy to become cynical or pessimistic, whether the point is to be real or not. However often I see people talking about movies that don't seem realistic and I think it's time now that people start realizing how funny these fantasies are.\"\n\nSo it can't get any better really? Even without Kristen Stewart she looked amazing in it! If anyone else wants to watch the movie I recommend grabbing some tissues because every time they show a new cut from the DVD there is always some nasty cut out…or worse it cuts just part way before getting cut off…just saying lol 🙂",
    "This film has been described as a \"horror-thriller,\" and it certainly delivers on that front, but it's also an incredibly well-crafted piece of art. The story follows a young man named Will (played by newcomer Jeremy Irvine) who finds himself in a strange town called New York City after being dumped by his girlfriend. He soon discovers that he can communicate with animals through their dreams, and he begins to investigate what happened to him. It's not long before he realizes that there are other people living in this world too, and they're all trying to survive. This is a very dark film, and I'm sure you'll be able to tell just how much darkness it contains without even watching it. But if you do decide to watch it, I highly recommend giving it a shot.\n\nI've seen the movie twice now, and each time I was blown away by its beauty and depth. The visuals are stunning, and the acting is top notch. There's no doubt that director Yorgos Lanthimos had a lot of fun making this film, and I think it's safe to say that he did a great job. If you haven't already seen it, I'd strongly suggest checking out the trailer below.",
    "This film is about a man who wakes up in an unfamiliar place and finds himself trapped there, unable to move or speak. He tries to escape but can't find his way out. The only thing he knows is that he's not alone. This is a story about how we deal with our fears and what it means to be human. It's also a story about how we cope with loss.\n\nI'm going to start by saying this is one of my favorite movies ever made. I've seen it twice now (once at the theater and once on DVD) and I still love it. But I have some issues with it. First off, I think the director should have been more careful with the pacing. There are several scenes where you're just sitting there waiting for something to happen. And then when it does, it's so sudden and unexpected that you don't really know what happened. Also, I feel like the ending was rushed. I mean, it's a horror movie after all! So why didn't they wait until the end? Why did they rush through the rest of the movie?\n\nBut let me tell you what I loved about this movie. It has great acting, great direction, and a great script. It's got a lot of heart. It's got a lot of humor. It's got a lot of emotion. It's got a lot of mystery. It's got a lot of suspense. It's got a lot of action. It's got a lot of gore. It's got a lot of sex.

    "A man who once led the Organization (IMF) in South Africa, Malcolm X was born Elijah Muhammad and raised as an adult by his mother, Ida B. Wells, with two older brothers, Martin Luther King Jr., Sr. and John Lewis (real name William E. Carter). His father was actually named George Bell, who did not care for him or his children so he left them with relatives as soon as they were old enough to walk, which wasn't until 10, when he married one of Dr. Seuss's sisters. Though most people consider Malcolm X to be the second coming of Jesus Christ, it has been said that Malcolm's personality was based on Muhammad Ali – who also lived in South Africa at the time, having converted to Islam in 1955 after his own life had fallen into disarray and despair. (Malcolm X's parents' divorce made this possible.) What started out as a civil rights leader became more radical as he developed a strong belief that white society was fundamentally immoral and had been created to benefit the aristocracy. He ended up leading his followers against the Southern government while becoming very vocal about why all Americans should work towards the abolition of poverty. At times, he got too outspoken and became involved in violent clashes with whites, but he always maintained good relationships with many black leaders and helped build a network of allies that he called 'the Mosque'. For years Malcolm served in the armed forces before being elected as a city councilman and later mayor. In 1963 he founded a non-profit organization known as Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) which advocated non-cooperation between blacks and whites. The group's goal was to integrate the public schools, the labor market and other social institutions through militant actions that could lead to police brutality. While several attempts failed at integration during Malcolm's lifetime, CORE was successful as its activism won support among millions of blacks across America. By 1965 CORE members numbered over 25,000 and continued pushing segregation on their own terms to make the point that racial equality was inevitable. During this period Malcolm turned to politics where he challenged Democratic Party leadership by running on an anti-war platform. After beating every major candidate in one primary race Malcolm took on incumbent President Lyndon Johnson in November 1968. Johnson responded with increasing violence and eventually was assassinated on April 4th, 1969. However, in the aftermath of Johnson's death white nationalists rallied around Malcolm X to rally around the",
    "The best and most hilarious movie of the year: Friends with Benefits is a funny, touching romantic comedy about a couple that gets together for a night of fun on a weekend when they're not working but still have to get together in a timely manner. The characters are very well-defined; the couple themselves are quirky, well-developed and believable. Some of their conversations on the way to the venue are very hilarious, and it adds to the charm. The jokes are also well-planned and delivered with full enthusiasm, which are the qualities that make \"Friends with Benefits' an enjoyable viewing experience.\n\nThis is the best of both worlds.\n\n[…]\n\nIt's all about the character. The two leads, Josh (John C. Reilly) and Lauren (Jillian Bell), are so well-written and developed that you don't care what their relationship is about. The chemistry between them is undeniable, while the chemistry between the cast is unbelievable; there's nothing like seeing the cast of \"Modern Family\" share some real, honest conversations, which help make this movie a really fun watch. It's a fantastic ensemble piece and the acting is top notch.\n\n[…]\n\nThe story and the characters are just as interesting, but the funniest parts of \"Friends With Benefits\" are the small moments between the two leads. This is one of those movies that is simply hilarious to watch alone but makes for great viewing when the gang hangs out.\n\n[…]\n\nIt's a really fun movie and I don't want to ruin it for you, but just be sure to check out the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHkBzs5s2wA\n\nRead also:",
    "Rule Number One: Never send your friends a link to your website. If one of them finds the site and makes any kind of complaint, your day may be ruined. Rule Number Two: Never answer your friends' emails on the weekends. You can be sure that someone is making a complaint about you in real life. Rule Number Three: Don't make your best friend an honorary member of the platoon. If he says to you something like, \"I am going out with my buddy tonight,\" you're in big trouble. Rule Number Four: Be careful what you say about your favorite movie. If you say something like, \"I've seen you two kiss before,\" people might start to think you're gay. Rule Number Five: If you're walking along the beach in the heat on a hot summer night and you happen to see someone in bed with his best friend, run the hell away. No one likes that. Rule Number Six: If your friend texts you that the hottest piece of ass he's ever seen is sitting in your front yard, ignore him. He probably wants you to get in a fight. Rule Number Seven: Don't tell your best friends about the movie in which you were in a rape scene. Even if you're not interested in it, your best friends will go along, anyway.

    "A lot of people wondered how Jettster Skywalker (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) would affect each other after he killed Han Solo a couple times. And then she got the lightsaber and suddenly it's like, why aren't they friends? Turns out that while their relationship isn't in fact destroyed — Daisy says, for example, he didn't hate her or something! — their pasts have been altered. Daisy explains to Luke: \"Rey feels strong,\" which is the closest we're going get to explain what it's like when \"being your true self is so hard.\" Is this something that'll be explored more as the sequel trilogy unfolds? Or does it just mean that Leia, Lando, Chewie and all those characters are getting along pretty well right now?

    "This film has been compared to \"300,\" but it's not quite as good, and that's because it doesn't have the same sense of urgency or stakes. It's also more of an action-adventure than a war epic. But if you're looking for something with some real heart, this one will do just fine. The story follows 300 Spartans who are trapped on a small island in the middle of the Persian Gulf after their city was destroyed by a massive earthquake. They must fight off a group of marauding Persians while trying to find food and water. There's plenty of action, including a battle scene where two men are thrown into a pit of boiling oil. And there's even a bit of romance between two women.\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.5/10",

    "I know Van Helsing is one scary movie, but to put my own face on it, I'm not happy with it at all (in the past few years I've been having more fun watching horror movies like Get Out). For example, in this movie we have quite realistic vampires and that's actually pretty cool. Even though they are still vampires, even if their appearance doesn't look very convincing… well that just shows how far vampire flicks went before we could watch them as being real. In this movie Dracula attacks by biting his victims back… again, real vampires do a lot of other things besides bite you back too. This also feels more realistic because once he grabs someone or tries something weird… he leaves a mark like he does everything else… But why did he kill those guys after turning both of their faces black? Wasn't there always supposed to be no human skin left when he transformed?\n\nWe get some amazing CGI effects here too. There was an action sequence where Dracula comes up behind Dr. Lestat and blows him away, and when Van Helsing turns around we see that part of the wall behind his hand has broken off… so there is definitely blood everywhere and he can fly with his hands… And then we go into another scene where he is about to turn a guy who gets knocked out of nowhere and falls down and vanishes… which makes me feel kinda strange (and sometimes not), because I thought Van Helsing did really good with its practical effects. If anything these scenes should have only lasted 3-4 seconds each, so you wouldn't miss much by seeing these slow-motion gags over and over…\n\nAnd then there is the fact there are literally 10 different types of weapons on the table that we see in this movie (from batsharks, axes to daggers)… but none of them use actual real weapons, and none of them are made of real swords. Most times during the fight scene if you ask anyone who is fighting what that weapon they wield is they will keep saying stuff that is 100% wrong based on one moment in the film. Or just outright lies. So yeah there are some problems here too. But I don't think I am really going to talk any sense into it and maybe later in this review there might be something cool to say.\n\nBut overall, with all such complaints said (there were many, and that",
    "This film is about an American Civil War veteran who was shot in the head during the Battle of Gettysburg, and then later died at age 32. The story follows his widow as she tries to find out what happened to her husband, and how he came to be killed. It's not clear if this is a true story or fictionalized account, but it does have some elements that are very similar to real life events. This is one of those films where you can't help but feel sorry for the people involved. I'm sure there were many more soldiers who would've been better off if they had just stayed home on leave.\n\nI don't know if this is a good movie, but I do think it's worth watching.",
    "\"Hilarious and often bizarre as they are terrifying, Robert Zemeckis's classic film about a team of lawmen in an isolated northwestern Washington town sets up one giant joke after another…Zemeckis clearly has a lot to say…This comedy takes its time coming into focus and then starts going wild right at the beginning and there really is no way out except a trip back to Seattle.\"\n\nIn case you aren't familiar with this film and the premise of it (an unhinged group of characters all looking to kill and/or eat each other), allow me to provide some background information on the story. During World War II, Roy Darrow, an alcoholic detective working for the Washington Patrol division, gets wind that The Enfield Poltergeist may have survived being abandoned during their wartime internment at Stalag Luft III by someone he thought was an escaped Red Chinese prisoner (the name of whom was kept closely under wraps). Darrow heads out to investigate with his partner Ted Kaczynski (Mark Hamill), but while en route to the place, they find a strange little house belonging to the son of Paul Baesler (Gus Van Sant) who worked at Eureka Motorwerks up until 1945 when the company went bankrupt. It becomes obvious that something terrible happened at Eureka that day, and so Kaczynski begins a search for answers; eventually locating the house where the ghost was supposedly being held captive. After the battle against the monsters leaves them both wounded, these two men take refuge in Roy's car, but mysteriously decide within the car to split apart – and disappear without a trace before a single step has been taken! For many years, Kaczynski has maintained the exact location of the lost house where he thinks the haunting went down on secret orders from an unknown, more powerful force that took him away, not wanting him knowing what to think or doing anything stupid himself. Meanwhile Darrow keeps fighting the ghosts in his dream-like memories, believing those moments in which he's forced to shoot each enemy to death were actually the only real episodes from pre-war Eureka because otherwise the entire affair would have made far too much sense, leading most experts in psychological trauma to conclude that \"Mr. Toreador\" wasn't just crazy and dangerous – he's psychotic!\n\nThen one morning two old friends called upon Roy and Ed to help recover",

This film is based off of the book \"Survival Island\" written by Robert Ludlum. It's not a very good movie but it does have some great moments that make up for its flaws.

    "Here's an important thing not to miss in Mississippi Burning: it has only ever been filmed before in Europe, not South Africa. The film (with its focus on American racism) was shot between 1983 and 1986 because that was the earliest time any Western was being shot about blacks since Django Reinhardt's 1967 The Birth of the Memphis Blues. This first-person narrative about a black woman making her way through the Jim Crow south reveals many things at once -- its setting in 1890s Oklahoma where people had just recently integrated; how little the blacks got paid compared with white men and women who were doing similarly dirty jobs; her struggles as she works hard to raise two children after the deaths of her husband, father and brother; the difficulty she faces dealing with the police on whom she relies for support despite having a criminal history as she comes across some of them over and over throughout the year-long shooting; how every scene with her can be made up more or less with one exception and then there are other scenes in which her son does everything without complaining at all -- except when he whimpers about his mother's work even though he doesn't understand what he's listening to and is clearly afraid; how no matter whose fault anything might have been, everybody knows black people were guilty as sin.\n\nThat, of course, will explain why most of us feel such a strong antipathy to this picture so much. It's also interesting, too, that no white people appear in Mississippi Burning -- or indeed anywhere else in the four movies (a rare exception), making the story much more inclusive than any previous biopic of the American social issue. It shows how much black people truly hated us back then – or did we? If nothing else, it shows that the prejudice didn't start here but that black people are capable of such bigoted behavior until very recently. Of course, nobody wants to believe that anybody could harbor racist sentiments but this movie, like those before it, seems so obviously false that you wonder if anyone watching ever thought anything more offensive would come out. That is why The New York Times calls it \"a film that never stops trying to offend.\"",

    "A film that has been in the making for over two years, Dangal is an epic tale of love and loss set against the backdrop of the Indian state of Karnataka. The story revolves around a young man named Ravi (Rishi Kapoor) who falls in love with a woman named Nani (Shraddha Kapoor). However, when he discovers she's pregnant, his life takes a dramatic turn as he must decide whether to keep her or not.\n\nIn addition to being one of India's most popular actors, Rishi Kapoor also happens to be one of its best-known directors. His films have won numerous awards including Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival, Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival, Best Screenplay at the Toronto International Film Festival, and Best Cinematography at the Venice Film Festival. He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2010.\n\nThis is the first time that Rishi Kapoor will appear on the big screen since his last film \"Kabhi Alvida Hai\". In fact, it's the first time he'll be seen in a Hindi film since 2008's \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan.\"\n\nWhile we wait for more information about this upcoming release, check out some photos below!",
    "Directed by Daniel Espinosa, \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\" is a vampire-thriller that examines the life of the 32nd US President through the eyes of his former rival (Andrew Garfield).\n\nThe tale of Lincoln and Sargent Shafter (played by the legendary Nicolas Cage) begins with their encounters as two men on a collision course: Lincoln versus Dracula, and Dracula versus Lincoln's life. To battle the otherworldly threat, the two go back to where it all began: their lives in Springfield, Illinois where Lincoln was born and grew up, and Shafter was raised with Lincoln in the town.\n\nThe movie's director, Daniel Espinosa, made this film in the mold of the old ghost-hunting films and classics: with an amazing premise, a great combination of real drama and amazing actors and sets. Every scene looks beautifully cast and delivered, with all the right music and sound effects.\n\nThe cast is top notch: Andrew Garfield (the Lincoln character) is a man with plenty of charisma, even when he's not speaking, as evidenced by his scenes with Robert Smigel – who plays Shafter – and in a few early scenes. His co-star, Benicio Del Toro, was great as the vampire-slaying lawyer Paul Woodrugh. While playing a lawyer, Del Toro plays a little too serious for my liking (he would have been much better if he played his character a bit more light-heartedly), but it just adds to the fun.\n\nEven in a slow-burn, it is the performances that separate this film from all the others: Nicolas Cage is a true star, delivering a really realistic and entertaining portrayal. I found him to be much more real in the movie than in any of his earlier performances and his performance is the perfect compliment for Garfield.\n\nAnother thing that struck me in the movie: the use of music. I won't mention each and every track, but it was great to see how many different people are in the credits.\n\nI felt like it was almost like a live-action music video: we see these people in their glory moments and the music reflects their emotions. We watch the film from one man's point of view and this helps a lot, as we are introduced to so many scenes through multiple perspectives.\n\nThe film is actually very \"sequ",
    "If you haven't seen director, Yoshiaki Nishimura's (Dennoun) first feature since 2007 is easily the high point of his oeuvre. If one can describe the movie as both stylish and intense – a true homage to 1970s classics like \"Planet Of The Apes\", it'll make more sense than I ever could in just reading the plot synopsis that can only be found online. It took me over 3 hours to finish the film in it's entirety.\n\n\nFor those few months when he couldn't get anyone else on board to finance him, \"Akira\" was directed by renowned animator Satoshi Kon… not a bad combination if you're looking to see a movie without too many distractions (the list of producers behind Kon and the script writer who had no involvement other than providing the ideas themselves can be looked up here) that isn't going to suck your life energy at the end of it… except for this guy, Akira, but we will get to that. The story begins with an old man called Watari, who's lost all recollection until one day whilst trying to find his family home, discovers he remembers everything about them, but the way people remembered them changed drastically with time. His memories have come back and haunt his attempts to remember those he loves and what happened to them…. or rather didn't happen to them; their stories don't mean anything because they never actually happened. In a way, he also has new friends in the form of Mitsuha and her brother, Ryo whose memory began to emerge after he himself awoke, leading into Watari's love triangle which may bring out some interesting character interactions given that Watari still feels unable to believe he really knows his childhood friend.\n\n\nWhen we do finally arrive at the story, it doesn't take long before we find ourselves rooting for Watari even though our initial expectation would be that everything after that point would involve two guys fighting each other and being eaten by hungry moths so it seems like there's really nothing left worth rooting for there in my opinion. This is where your taste buds will begin to deteriorate however; the film is often extremely slow paced at times and relies solely on visuals to tell its story. When there isn't great dialogue, visuals become paramount and are used appropriately to deliver information in any scene and show how things affected the characters in various ways. With more attention paid during such scenes, the focus",
    "This film is based on the novel by Anthony Horowitz, and it's about Winston Churchill who was Prime Minister during World War II. The story follows him as he tries to keep Britain together in the face of an enemy that has been gathering strength since before the war began. He also faces his own personal demons when he realizes that he may have made some mistakes while leading the country. This film is not only a great historical drama but also a very good thriller with a lot of action scenes. It's a must see for any fan of history or thrillers.\n\nI'm going to give this movie 4 stars out of 5 because I think it does a pretty decent job at telling its story. There are a few things that could be improved upon though. First off, there were a couple times where I thought the pacing was a little slow. But overall, I really enjoyed this movie.",

    "Movie Review\n\n(5/10) -- I feel like every kid who wants to be an actor just has to do that one audition after another but my dream job was as a cartoonist on Disney TV, and this was the first animated feature since 1989. Even though this turned out not to be so much of a family-friendly film, it's got good stuff in it because the story is actually pretty neat...but the scriptwriter totally screwed up his concept and the voice talent did not sound too keen about doing any more work for him because he didn't know how to draw anything other than a stupid mustache...what a waste! Still, his wife sings the songs on screen nicely with her deep pipes but she wouldn't have lasted three months if he had wanted that kind of talent around anyway and they'd been working together at Disney all their lives...so I'm going to give him credit because it was probably worth it to make her smile for that while we all are stuck crying because she hates the way I said \"fetch\".\n\n\nIn short, I'm giving this 4 stars primarily to the songs instead of what could have been better because those lyrics were terrible anyway, although some of the acting (most noticeably Will Ferrell as the Genie / Jasmine / Agrabah/etc.) was solid, plus the music by Brian Wilson is very nice. And yeah, I've never heard The Magic Number.",
    "Barry Lyndon is in many ways like a contemporary epic or Shakespearean tragedy. We encounter it while contemplating modern life, our times, and how we are affected by them. But on an even deeper level it's as much about love as about death, or the dying desire to hold onto a moment through those fleeting moments in life itself. Like Robert Kennedy and his own son, King may be seen as playing out a personal narrative throughout this film that he wants us to see as well...to follow the footsteps of Barry, who seeks a place (a woman) with no memories left behind but hopes he can find peace with her and their unborn child with them. The ending leaves us hanging, wondering if we've truly seen Barry dead (not dead), whether this will lead to more than platonic goodbyes, and what may yet happen next. Ultimately however you believe or not (and there's ample opportunities later to read either positive or negative sentiments into the movie for yourself) the last 15 minutes (roughly half its run time) have been one of these masterpieces of filmmaking- you don't want anything else after them. There are so many cinematic techniques used in the film, some very subtle (the look at a clock made of glass on wall sconces throughout; the use of handheld camera close ups with the actors eyes focused down for the wide shot, especially when they're looking directly at each other), others really pushing your brain, which you could argue were probably better utilized if done by more traditional filmmakers, because here, where both cinematography and editing are just great, this is the film for you!\n\n\nWhile, I won't deny that there are problems in regards to directing and music (no dialogue cues for long sequences, bad sound mixing where background music starts before any important scene/action sequence goes in, etc. etc.), overall every problem seems so minor when considered with all it does right for the final product. When viewed in totality, this looks like a movie in need of only two edits. First, edit 2, removing scenes that lack purpose while also including parts within to increase the effect of its characters. Second, remove footage that detracts too MUCH from what was already excellent.",
    "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073470/\n\nAlien is so different, so exciting, that it has remained a cult film to this day, with even a few die hard fans still clamoring to see it. With its haunting score, and the most jaw dropping visuals that any sci-fi film has done in decades, it was all the more strange to see so many people going completely apeshit in their discussion of it.\n\nI'll be honest here, and say that at times, it felt extremely disrespectful to fans not to make some attempt to talk about Ridley Scott's masterpiece. After all, the critics were never going to take this film as seriously as fans did, and they should be making some effort to try and understand where this film came from, as to better take it as something worthwhile.\n\nHowever, you can see just by going through the IMDb comments on this movie that it definitely doesn't come across as any kind of \"serious\" film. There are a few good points though, with director James Cameron having an enjoyable time at times, and a good cast that adds to the fun (I'm particularly fond of Ellen Ripley, who has some real bite to her performance). I also would like to make a point that although I really enjoy the concept, in the end, it all feels kind of gimmicky, especially since it feels like a prequel to the original film that comes out six months later, and doesn't actually follow the journey of the Nostromo crew in any great detail (to the point where if you are watching this film without a complete understanding of Star trek history and mythology, you would probably find it pretty weak). The most notable point that comes in my mind though is when the Alien is in the room with Ripley (that was cool and all), and it looks like they are fighting again. The ending actually doesn't feel right either, as although it ended up perfectly in the ending to the original film, it just feels like there is so much \"more\" to come from those two characters that it almost felt like a waste of time.\n\nHowever other then all that though, and despite what I kind of just described, this was an enjoyable film to watch, and if you can get it through to the last credits, it will probably give you more bang for your buck than even the biggest \"Star Wars",

    "1\n\nAudiences may wonder why they should bother with this film, since its musical score was done by Hans Zimmer, one-third of the legendary film scores he created during his career which started with 1974's Metropolis and continued to 2005's After Menace (another Academy Award nomination). And how does music play into what might be considered an allegorical or historical drama about a young girl forced under Nazi occupation? That could sound strange if you see the trailer alone. There's no dialogue; the main character barely seems human. All that she experiences comes in flashes, sometimes in the form of memories, like when she learns of the fate of her beloved grandfather (played by Hans Conried) at last through one of the radio stations broadcasting the news of WW2. The scene where Sebastian goes on the run after hearing over the radio of the destruction caused by the SS's bombing of Berlin gets even more dramatic in color because we can see him run as the bombs fall overhead. Then there's the beautiful ending where the woman returns home where everybody applauds for her actions in saving her family, when in fact all that happened had already been planned by Heinrich Hahn (who got the job due to his famous work on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), who knew exactly that this scene would happen the way it did in real life... and had even put his own plans forward years ago!\n\n\nOf course, a large part of the film lies not outside reality but inside our heads. The narrator refers us to a quote from a letter addressed August 19th 1938. He's clearly looking back in time about events surrounding the world's greatest showman, Melchior Wulfhausen, a genius whose ability managed, without exaggeration, to make millions of people believe in the power of music--not as music, but as a magical force to give some purpose to a society going mad from war and deprivation. One thing many critics seemed unable to understand is how the Nazis were able to convince so many people that Hitler wasn't their enemy but, rather, that the Nazi party is the only legitimate choice. This is a classic case where good intentions are easily distorted by circumstance. In fact, though I didn't fully get everything, this is pretty much what happens around the town in Germany where these shows take place, particularly those shows set here about World War II, where people feel deeply inspired by them, whether",
    "What makes it work this time?\n\nA lot of what makes the Shrek universe unique is that they are so different. First, we're not supposed to care about the Princesses; it's just the villainous Prince Charming and his sister Rapunzel who hold attention spans, though in more ways than one when he pulls on her hair before she goes back to sleep at night in order to get to the castle (which makes sense given the time of day). Second, we're never really invested into their love life, which feels almost too casual. Finally, each movie tends to be about something, all while remaining original enough for it to stand out without being too derivative. Here all three factors come together quite nicely. The first half deals with how the main character gets stuck working in a shoe factory. There's a fair amount going on over there, but each bit keeps things moving forward instead of bogging everything down in detail or repetition – I feel like things will only take off if we keep learning about Shrek as a person. One problem is that it can become quite repetitive due to how quickly we learn and forget. This movie has a LOT of information thrown our way every hour or so (a few dozen) – we should hear new stuff whenever possible…and some things are just better left forgotten.\n\nIf you were curious what the rest of the world thought of the upcoming animated film: Why would anyone want to see this when \"Frozen\" has already been released??? They're both great movies, yes – and neither are meant to be seen by everyone. But when people point to similarities between the two films – and many actually do (even though they don't know its true intended meaning), that doesn't make either version any less beloved than the other. Sure, it may take some explaining…but it's still something worth checking out, wouldn't you agree? That said, if you are trying to escape your crush, go watch Frozen ASAP, because it'll bring all those feelings crashing down upon your head again.\n\n\nHow does it compare to an original story arc, film series or book installment?\n\nI have to disagree. It's hard for me to judge, because we rarely watch a film these days where there are more twists and turns than within any single episode/film/TV show. However, as long as an actor is doing their job well and",

    "This film has been described as a \"fantasy-thriller,\" and it certainly delivers on that front, but it's also an incredibly well-crafted piece of work. The story follows a young man named Aragorn (Orlando Bloom) who finds himself in a world where he must fight to save his people from the evil forces of Sauron (Andy Serkis). It's not exactly a new concept, but this one really does feel like something special.\n\nBloom plays Aragorn with such sincerity and warmth that you can't help but root for him. He's a character who doesn't have any real flaws or weaknesses; he just wants to do what's right. And while there are some moments when he seems to be going through the motions, he never loses sight of what's important. This makes him a very likable protagonist, even if he isn't always able to pull off the most heroic feats.\n\nSerkis' performance is equally impressive. His portrayal of Sauron is absolutely terrifying, and he brings so much depth to the role that it's hard to believe he was ever cast in anything else. He gives the character a sense of menace that is almost frighteningly realistic.\n\nBut the true star of the show here is Andy Serkis. He's given a lot of credit for bringing the characters to life, but I think it's safe to say that he's more than capable of doing it all by himself. He's got a great range, and he uses it to great effect throughout the entire film.\n\nI'm not sure how many times I've seen this movie, but I don't remember seeing anyone else playing the part of Sauron. That alone should make this a must see for fans of fantasy movies.",

But as I found time to watch it, it turns into one of those movies that makes the whole thing sound a little sad to be watching.

The film's first review on the website, the 5.5-star review, was the only one not written by a critic that was a part of the press tour that the documentary was being given. According to IMDb, both of the reviews were written by people who were not involved with the film for publicity or publicity purposes. I am pretty sure that the 5.5-star review by Jason Schreier was based on his review of \"The Martian.\"\n\nThere is nothing wrong with putting your review first on the website because it's meant to be a review; it's not a recommendation. I have a very strong opinion about what I feel the movie is about so I probably wouldn't change my opinion of it if I hadn't seen it. But by being first on the site, you're saying that these things don't matter to you and just like everyone else you just click on their review.

So just think about it before entering the theater!\n\n\nIMDB Movie Rating (out of 5 stars): 3 out of 5 stars. \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" isn't exactly a fantastic movie except for the Captain America storyline surrounding Steve Rogers taking his revenge on the Soviet Union even though he did lose the War to them and ended up having multiple heart attacks before dying. However we have a great cameo-filled story involving Captain America (and also Thor and The Hulk), and we get plenty of action sequences to keep us busy when it gets hard for Cap to move around in space and fight with a variety of different enemies like Red Skull for example. But overall it is missing something that makes it a classic Marvel Comics adventure. Well, it certainly has its share of original ideas but unfortunately the execution wasn't well thought out or executed leading to a good deal of technical issues throughout most of the presentation because the animation didn't feel fluid enough to move smoothly along any cinematic plot lines and as soon the music and graphics got too much we're usually at big fights when the whole thing could have been handled much more smoothly when a villain jumps up on camera and starts attacking! One could say that the lack of visual clarity of the animations may be what turned off some hardcore fans of the franchise but to people coming into the genre expecting a flawless portrayal it should become one of the worst things that happened during production (or perhaps they just were not paying attention at the beginning of filming). Nonetheless if for no other reason to the average",
    "\"Cars\" (directed by the late Paul Allen) is a movie that is best enjoyed both in its own universe and as a complete experience, where the events of the movie take place simultaneously and in parallel to those of the series it follows. The film centers on the life and legacy of entrepreneur Owen Wilson, son of famous cartoonist Mouse and sister of famous sports fan Lightning McQueen.\n\n\"Cars\" (released in 2001) is a film that explores the differences between the two worlds of the world of sports and entertainment. Owen Wilson lives in the world of sports, where he is considered to be an icon in his field. He has his own celebrity newspaper, books and video games. In contrast to this world, he's living a life of celebrity as a celebrity. It is this juxtaposition of the worlds and cultures that makes \"Cars\" one of the most captivating movies of the '90s. (Also see: The 25 Best Sports Movies Ever Made)\n\nWhen Owen Wilson accidentally breaks an oil pipeline, his good friend Lightning McQueen and his friend and business partners decide to help and provide the new and improved replacement for the pipeline.\n\nThe film does a great job of mixing up the tones in this movie, by using action and drama scenes and still picture comedy scenes, while adding in some family-related humor; some of which doesn't make sense at first until you realize they're supposed to be funny. Even with the slight hick stuff, the movie doesn't rely too heavily on these scenes. Rather, this movie is the perfect mix between action/adventure/comedy/fantasy and the sports part.\n\nThe movie centers around the lives of this father-son team – played by Owen Wilson and Michael J. Fox — as they deal with the difficulties of being successful in the entertainment business, while also coping with the challenges of everyday life. Owen Wilson, as a self-made man who created his own movie, \"Cars,\" plays a fictionalized version of himself. He's the driving force behind \"Cars,\" in contrast to McQueen, who is the founder of a new sports club called the \"Lions.\" The two characters both know how to overcome adversity and have the unique qualities that define success in these worlds.\n\nHowever, what sets \"Cars\" apart from other sports movie films is that, while it explores the",
    "This film has been called \"Disney's first gay moment.\" It was released in March, 2016, and it stars Emma Watson as Belle, an orphaned young woman who falls in love with a handsome prince (Josh Gad). The story follows her journey to find him, and how she comes out to herself and others.\n\nIn this review, I will be discussing the film's message on acceptance, gender identity, and sexuality.\n\nI am not going to discuss the plot or characters because they are irrelevant to my opinion. Instead, I want to focus on the message that the film sends about accepting yourself and your own body.\n\nAs a transgender person, I have always felt like there were two sides to every story. There was the side that told me that I should accept myself and live life as the person I wanted to be, and then there was the side that told me that I shouldn't. This film does both.\n\nWhen Belle meets the Prince, he tells her that he loves her for who she is. He says that he wants to protect her, but also that he wants to make sure that she knows that he loves her. She accepts his offer, and they begin their relationship.\n\nLater, when she learns that the Beast is actually a man named Gaston, she rejects him. She doesn't know what to do, so she runs away from home. When she returns home, she finds that the Beast has changed into a beautiful woman named LeFou. She realizes that she can't change back, and she decides to stay with him.\n\nLeFou is a strong female character. She is brave, intelligent, and kind. She is also very feminine, which makes her even more relatable. In fact, she is one of the few Disney princesses who isn't defined by her beauty.\n\nShe is also a lesbian. While most people would think that being a lesbian would mean that you're weak, LeFou proves otherwise. She is strong enough to stand up to Gaston, and she is smart enough to understand why he is attracted to her.\n\nWhile some might say that this is just another example of Disney making a queer-friendly film, I disagree. I believe that this film shows us that we don't need to define ourselves by our sexual orientation. We can embrace who we are without having to hide it",

    "\"This is a movie about death, one of those rare, emotional experiences that can take you right back to childhood. This time around the main character, Tom, is taking the blame for his deceased wife; he believes that no one else would survive his suicide, that they are still alive. We see him relive each of his wife's deaths, taking on the role of her ghost in the process. This is, needless to say, a very depressing film. One that is based completely around the subject of death, and that in the end will leave you feeling more sad than it should.\n\nIn the aftermath of the final funeral scene, where Tom gives his wife's ashes a homey send off with a simple touch, there is a strong undertone of a sadness to both the film and the characters. Tom, in particular, plays it with great conviction and his determination to keep his dead wife's spirit in heaven is a great demonstration of his belief in his \"god\" or'spirit' or whatever you prefer to call them.\"\n\nAlso check out:\n\nMemento Trailer – A Sci-Fi Thriller and the Art of David Lynch (Video)\n\nThe Art of David Lynch Movie – David Lynch and the Making of \"Memento\".\n\nIf you're enjoying our content and would like to support us, please buy the DVD, Blu-Ray or download it to your computer or Apple TV from Amazon.com.

    "\"Caddyshack\" is one of the most memorable comedy movies ever made, in my opinion, and one of the greatest comedies of all time, period. It was directed by Ivan Reitman and is loosely based on the exploits of a lovable group of New York-based golfers, consisting of Harry Houdini and Dean Martin. It's got some brilliant lines, some ridiculous gags and some excellent acting. Some of it is even funny from a musical standpoint. This is a very entertaining movie that gets you out of the way quickly so you can get straight to the action.\n\nIt does have some serious moments, such as when a golf pro plays golf with Dean Martin and Harry Houdini, and the two start laughing hysterically. These moments, like the golf pro who tells Harry Houdini that he has the potential to set the sport on its head, are not at all funny. Still, \"Caddyshack\" isn't full of jokes and you're better off skipping some of the heavier parts.\n\nA few more quotes: \"Dizzy Gillespie is a little on the short side... He's a small fellow and he's like that, so he has only one thing to say when he speaks. It's 'Hey,' but it's not that funny...\" \"He came to our party to help with the drinking.\" \"I don't see Dean Martin as a comedian, but a musician... If we have a meeting with some musical groups or something, he goes down to the studio and puts us in the studio and sits in the booth, makes all the arrangements... He plays keyboard with us,\" Dean Martin said years after the movie, \"but I never met him in a comedy club.\" \"He can sing! He can sing just about anything. If he's in a band, he can sound like anything, because he's really talented,\" Dean Martin said years later. \"He can do anything on the keyboard, so it doesn't get old for him. He's very good,\" Houdini said of Dean Martin. \"Dean said he couldn't sing very well because he gets so frustrated, so he'd have to get angry and yell at himself. We had to sit on his knee and play piano chords on his hand to keep him happy.\" \"When Dean Martin talks about Dean Martin, he never says 'Dean Martin.' He always",
    "This is an interesting film, and I'm not sure if it's going to be as successful as its predecessor, but it does have some good ideas that could work well in other films. The story is about a young man who has been diagnosed with cancer, and his family tries to help him cope with the situation. It's a very simple plot, but there are some great performances here. There's also a lot of action scenes, which is always nice. This is one of those movies where you can't really tell what's happening on screen because everything just seems so fast-paced. But this doesn't mean that the acting isn't good. The actors all do their jobs well, and they're all given enough time to show off their talents. The only problem I had was with the ending. I thought it was pretty weak, and I think it would've worked better if it ended at the end of the first act. Overall, though, this is a fun little flick that should appeal to fans of the Rocky franchise.",
    "In 2008, director Terrence Malick released his third film in the \"Tree of Life\" trilogy, entitled Inherent Vice. As Malick's most personal narrative yet - which explores what it means to suffer depression -- the film was hailed as one of his best yet with many critics praising one of the most emotionally draining film experiences I've ever had the pleasure to experience on my own terms. To top that off, this might be Malick's greatest achievement thus far in the 'tree' franchise; his most personal work since 2011's Knight of Cups (a movie I really like very much and consider to be perhaps his magnum opus). But did any critic know that in addition to his latest films, Malick also produced The New World, an award-winning independent feature produced by acclaimed filmmaker Terry Gilliam? It also features other recognizable names such as Richard Linklater, David O. Russell and Tom Hardy!\n\n\nA beautiful girl (Joanna Cassidy) takes up residence at the home of her deceased father (Bill Paxton), who has been accused in court of being part of a sex ring of people trafficking young girls into Japan. A new resident in town named Jake (Hugh Keays-Byrne) meets up with the girlfriend of another friend of this woman, Emma (Amanda Seyfried), but it isn't long before some shocking discoveries are made about these seemingly innocent women and their hidden troubles behind closed doors.\n\n\nIt should come as no surprise this film contains everything you could hope for, and nothing more (except maybe all those plot holes that make me doubt the existence of life after death, or whether there are actual supernatural powers within society?). With the exception of all characters making random phone calls while at least pretending they aren't, a few scenes are entirely unconvincing with character motivations being questionable at best. Yet we must put the pieces back together in order to discover their real motives in a story so deeply layered, involving so many elements throughout the entirety. From enigmatic character interactions to intense fight sequences, everyone involved is brilliantly committed to what Malick created here. You might think this film was the same thing with two different actors playing the lead roles, though I would argue that it actually has slightly more variation per actor. As a result, you can easily pick out each, even if only a quick glance will reveal them. Although, as the",

    "Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War — This movie does not have a great chance of being the next \"Million Dollar Baby\", which is not a good sign, given that it is directed by one of the most prolific directors working today…. \"The Brothers\" was also not a great movie, but it had a fantastic villain, despite being too long; it is much better than the remake, \"The Brothers\".\n\nIn this movie, two guys who have nothing in common and whose lives completely change because they discover they have a common connection are forced to overcome their own differences and come together in a way that may not be possible with two people their own age. This movie takes its first half-hour or so to get into its own stride (I like where it is going), but then the pace picks back up. There are some pretty amazing set pieces that you have to see to fully appreciate the film. The story is interesting, and I feel like it has potential to explore more of our own inner lives and relationships.\n\nBut it seems, from what I read, that this guy was more concerned with what he was going to say in a \"Tae Guk Gi\" interview in which he is shown to be not so much a smart, cool, mature, or good-looking guy; more of a loudmouth with a great big heart.\n\nRating: Two stars.\n\n-Michael\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nReddit\n\nFacebook",
    "Apocalypse is once again cast as a mutant, so you would think he would fit nicely into the film. But the director has done a lot of tweaking to the original story, so that Apocalypse has something of a plot twist this time. Basically, once again the X-Men get in enough trouble due to their \"mutant\" status, they end up back in the same place. They want to stop their own undoing due to the actions X-Men fans expect to see in the sequels. They know that a big event is coming and they don't want to get caught off guard, so they try to do what seems to be the right thing, but really they are trying to escape the impending destruction that is coming.\n\nThis film has the potential to deliver a fantastic ending to another event, and it's definitely the most intriguing part of the story. Though we don't know exactly what happens right after the scene on the boat in \"Apocalypse.\" It's only a couple of years, so it's probably safe to assume that they won't have to fight or anything. And that is a good thing because now that we got this preview of what can happen, I can't wait for the film to come out in April 2017. I could be talking about this film long after it comes out, but unfortunately, this review is getting late, especially since it's the most interesting aspect of the film.\n\nThe only other thing that was interesting about this film was the addition of a younger version of Quicksilver along with an older version of Scarlet Witch. Scarlet Witch was in the films \"Age of Ultron\" and is a genius, just like she was in her own comic book series where she became a friend of Captain Marvel, or she worked with her father and other mutants like the Sentinels and even the Skrulls. She's not an original character, but to me, I liked watching her be in \"X-Men: Apocalypse.\" She was an interesting addition to the movie. She's definitely my favorite aspect of this film with the movie not being able to keep me from thinking about her.",

This is a very well-made film that has some great performances and a good plot. I really enjoyed watching this film because it was so different than most other films out there. There were no explosions or action scenes. Instead we had a lot of quiet moments where you could just sit back and enjoy the scenery. The cinematography was beautiful and the music was perfect. The only thing that bothered me was the ending which felt rushed and didn't make sense. Overall, I think this is one of those movies that will stay with you long after you've seen it.\n\nI'm going to give this movie a 4/5 stars.",

It's also one of those movies where you can't help but feel like you're watching something special. This is a great example of how to make a good superhero movie.\n\nI've seen this movie twice now, once in theaters and again on DVD. Both times I was blown away by the quality of the picture and sound. The Blu-ray has been improved upon with better audio and video than the original release. The only thing that really bothers me about the Blu-ray version is that there isn't any commentary track. That being said, if you want to hear what director Christopher Nolan had to say about his process or the making of the film, then you'll be happy to know that he did provide some insight into the production.\n\nIf you haven't already seen this movie, then go out and buy yourself a copy.

    "This film is an adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy novel, The Hobbit. It stars Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins and Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey. This film was directed by Peter Jackson and produced by Fran Walsh. The story follows the journey of Bilbo Baggins (Wood) who is on his way to Rivendell with the help of the wizard Gandalf (McKellen). They are accompanied by the hobbit-like creature Merry (Ian Holm), the elf Sam Gamgee (Richard Armitage), and the giant Gollum (Andy Serkis). The film also features Elijah Wood as Saruman the White, the evil wizard who has been plotting against the good wizard Gandalf. The film was released in December 2001.\n\nI have seen this movie twice now and I must say that it is one of my favorite movies ever made. The acting is great and the story is very well done. The only thing that bothers me about this movie is the fact that there were no dwarves or elves in the movie. There were some scenes where they showed us what the dwarves looked like but nothing else. Also, the music is not that great either.

    "\"In this James Bond adventure written and directed by Sam Mendes, \"Spectre\" stars Daniel Craig and Léa Seydoux and revolves around a group of high-level secret agents dispatched to Britain in the early part of the 21 st century to investigate the mysterious disappearance of British spy and secret agent, Evelyn Smythe.\n\nThe film is heavily dependent upon the powers of its Bond female characters the two major leads of this Bond flick; Daniel Craig playing James Bond and Léa Seydoux as Evelyn. Seydoux is played by the terrific actress, and actress, and the co-writer and co-director of this film, Léa Seydoux; although the two roles are often played by women.\n\nLéa shows an undeniable range and skill in this movie along with Daniel Craig who has a great sense of presence and a brilliant sense of humor in the roles of James Bond and Evelyn Smythe.\n\nThe plot of the film is complex to say the least. In the beginning of the movie we see James Bond in his room, he sits in his recliner, his computer and his phone are all off and he is taking a good look at his watch while watching Evelyn leave his house, it's that perfect scene. He enters his apartment and heads straight to his room. The film then cuts to a sequence where a shadowy figure wearing a gray hooded coat enters his apartment. As a scene it seems rather out of place and awkward at this point. But the moment seems to go on for a few more minutes, maybe a moment more? After a few more minutes we cut forward in time to Bond entering Evelyn's study. It then cuts back and forth and it's like a chess match between Bond and the figure.\n\nThat is the kind of action that's always going to make for excellent cinematography and special effects and the action sequences in this film are full of action and energy. This movie has a tremendous and impressive plot and it's intriguing to see this Bond cast go to work. The villain is played quite well not just by the brilliant, and fantastic Daniel Craig but also by the very dynamic and entertaining British actor Léa Seydoux as Evelyn's sister; it's so easy to care about the character of Evelyn. In a way I felt Daniel and Léa acting off of each other really made L",

    "As an actor playing one of those characters, it was never easy being \"Johnny\", until now. The most recent movie in the Johnny Depp's Depp Trilogy (a group that includes The Rum Diary and this month's The Wall) might be the easiest and more joyous to see thus far. It is so beautifully played that when I heard the opening song by Toto 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow', while watching myself, I forgot how tired my eyes were after all these years. Yes, this would normally be the moment where my reviews go silent or turn into rant-y diatribes as you start complaining about some aspect of the film- its cast, plot, visuals, dialogue… or the fact that it doesn't have any English subtitles… but with Inside Man it somehow manages. As much fun as \"Pirates Of The Caribbean 4″ already had as an action adventure comedy… inside man's humor feels like a breath of fresh air after its predecessor; something we don't often hear or take with us when watching movies… and yet also the kind of lighthearted fun to enjoy the night as well. Inside Man is almost just as witty in its acting and story telling, so whether you loved the first three (in addition to Depp's charmingly sinister-but-not creepy character) or are new to them or have enjoyed them before, there really isn't too much else to write home about. \"Man in Black 2\" did not quite do what I wanted it to on most accounts when given the chance to follow up… but even though it wasn't quite as good as I expected, it still served its purpose to get me through a rainy Sunday afternoon without getting grumpy. Not unlike the previous movies we have seen, if the humor just left me frustrated enough and didn't give me something I felt could help further the film (like some funny lines, the way people talked behind the camera or some interesting scenes), then even all the other jokes wouldn't matter to me. Luckily this wasn't the case here. My favorite scene throughout was probably Jack Sparrow's part which showed him taking his girlfriend Mary Callahan out for dinner while surrounded by his crew members drinking rum and talking dirty at his bar… the final shot made his character look very happy, rather than sad or defeated. A nice touch. So overall this whole package has been a real pleasant surprise despite the many flaws I saw within",

    "My friend recently sent me a bunch of links to movies, articles, books, etc, that were related to the movie \"The Great Escape\". They were all good and he gave me a bunch of recommendation for other things. I figured I'd post them here on The Movie Guy.\n\nThis is The Great Escape, starring John Wayne. John Wayne was a very interesting movie. It starts with the hero, played by Wayne, waking up in a cage. He decides to escape and sets off for Europe hoping to make a lot of money. A few things about the movie:\n\n1) The whole film is set in a giant prison.\n\n2) Wayne got really, really drunk (he probably got maybe four bottles of wine).\n\n3) The prisoners were in fact in on the plot to help him escape and the guards were actually in on the plan to let him go.\n\n4) This movie has a really big \"my mom is a cop\" moment.\n\n5) John Wayne is the definition of a \"chutzpah\".\n\nThis movie also features the most uneducated character in movie history. The police officer is referred as a \"lawman\", meaning he has some sort of legal qualification.\n\nThis movie was shot completely in France, so naturally the French language was used. The French version is dubbed into English.\n\nThe movie's director, Roger Vadim made some weird choice to film the movie at night. Most movies this high budget would shoot at night and in dark. But they decided to film in France at night because it was the closest to the actors that they could get.\n\nThe actors in the movie also all had a rather large range of personalities. There is a young kid running around who tries to be funny and gets pretty drunk (even though he's still drunk). There is the older hero who is not very funny and actually has some lines. There is the young hero who is much funnier and also has lines. There's the tough drunk who is not very funny at all (but is surprisingly funny at times). The movie ends with the young hero trying to save a beautiful man who was about to be sodomized.\n\nI enjoyed this movie immensely, it's pretty much the movie I have had my eye on since I saw a \"War of the Worlds\" trailer a few years ago.

    "This film was directed by Michael Bay and stars Mark Wahlberg, Shia LaBeouf, Nicola Peltz, Jack Reynor, Stanley Tucci, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, and Anthony Hopkins. The story follows the Autobots as they attempt to stop Megatron (Jack Reynor) from destroying Earth. This film also features an appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger who plays the role of Optimus Prime.\n\nI have seen this movie twice now and I can say that it is not bad at all. It has some good action scenes and the characters are well developed. However, there were several things about this movie that made me cringe. First off, the Transformers themselves are very boring. They look like robots with no personality or character. Secondly, the plot is extremely predictable. There are many times when you think something will happen but nothing happens. Thirdly, the music in this movie is terrible. It sounds like someone playing a piano on a cheap synthesizer. Fourthly, the special effects are pretty lame. Fifthly, the voice acting is awful. Sixthly, the ending is just plain stupid. Seventhly, the special effects are so poor that I am surprised they even bothered making them. Lastly, the special effects are so bad that I would be embarrassed if my kids saw this movie.\n\nOverall, I give this movie a C+.",
    "This is an interesting film, and I'm not sure if it's worth watching. It has some good action scenes, but they're all pretty generic. The story is also very predictable, with the main character being a hot rodder who gets into trouble when he tries to get his car back after getting stolen by a gang of thugs. He ends up in jail, where he meets a girl named Tanya (played by Jennifer Garner), who helps him out of prison. They have sex, and then she leaves him. He goes on the run, and eventually finds himself in a small town called Hot Springs, Arkansas. There are two things that make this film stand out from other movies about hot rods. First, there's a lot of nudity. Second, there's a scene where the main character is having sex with a woman while wearing only a towel. This is one of those films that you can't help but laugh at. But it does have its moments. For example, there's a scene where the main character is driving down a road and sees a man dressed as a cowboy riding a horse. He stops and asks what he's doing, and the man says, \"I'm just trying to look cool.\" That's pretty funny. Overall, though, this isn't a great movie.",

    "Based on a true story from filmmaker Woody Allen, \"To Rome With Love\" may take its title from William Goldman's classic novel of the same name (a fact that was kept in the film), but we can all agree that the tale is about a guy who lives for relationships. This new film directed by Robert Hays (\"A Perfect Romance\") is an extremely romantic love story that centers around the relationship between a woman and her mother who have had 10 children by three fathers in a little more than two decades. Annie Hall stars Mia Farrow, Lily Tomlin, Diane Keaton, Lainé Jeffries and John Goodman in her first turn as a leading lady since 1967's \"Sugarland Express.\" After being denied a father figure by her divorced parents, Elaine and Howard (Lance Guest) open their home to Annie (Farrow), trying to get past their own hurt feelings after discovering she has had three lovers. The plot takes a bit to settle down with a certain Mrs Wallingford (Julia Roberts). In this charming rom-com comedy starring a terrific ensemble cast - all veterans of big screen fare - Mr. Allen delivers his usual witty humour. What makes this one go is not only its romantic love story or the sweet performances within it but how well they play off each other. We are treated to some beautifully shot closeups and scenes where scenes play out against the wallpaper. Also, there is none of Woody Allen's infamous use of sex and innuendo so far as nudity, for example. An intriguing idea combined perfectly in \"Annie Hall,\" \"Tale As Old As Time\".

    "There's no shortage of superhero movies, and the \"It\" cast is no exception. But it isn't just the name of the film that draws you into \"It.\" No, this is one of the best-acted and most visually attractive pieces of cinema I've seen in a long time. The pacing is great, and director Andy Muschietti delivers a script that features not a hint of superfluous dialogue or unnecessary character development. It's perfect.\n\n\nThe movie follows a small group of characters who work together trying to stop whatever is wreaking havoc on America. It's a strange and wonderfully imaginative concept that is executed impeccably. It's a little slow for a superhero movie, and there's some pacing issues in the later half, because there are a lot of characters to balance out, but that's ok because the characters are all so complex and believable. One of my favorite things about the movie is the fact that it has so many different tones and genres being explored. It's a very complex movie with elements from horror and mystery, to comedy and horror. When all the parts gel together, the result seems more like a work of art than a typical blockbuster.\n\nSome people have said that the script for this film felt a little \"cliche,\" and it's true that there's some repetition, but it's the type of repetition that really comes together in a work of art. It makes the script feel like it all came together in one place. There are some moments of darkness, like when the characters are forced to kill people (even though they're not required to, it just feels too personal) and some moments of comedy, but it's more about the mixture of tones with each scene than the type of movie the film is. This film feels like it was meant to be a lot of things all at once.\n\n\nI've not yet decided what I think about the movie after seeing it, but after a certain segment in the movie, it's hard to look back at it and not see the flaws with the script. There was a bit too much reliance on exposition for me, and also it had some scenes that felt rushed and rushed, like when the parents (who come to the US because their own country keeps trying to kill them) go hunting for a missing child but are just constantly told to sit and wait.\n\n\nThere are also some problems with tone and pacing.",
    "There aren't many times in comedy history the words are used to describe any movie more than once. As in; \"This is the worst movie of the year\", \"This film is so bad it has to be a parody of itself\", \"This movie is so bad it doesn't even deserve to be referred to\". But, in the case of \"South Park\", the words \"bad\" and \"ridiculous\" are uttered as often as \"good\" and \"fine.\" It never gets to be the latter, that being said, \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" could very well be the best \"South Park\" movie ever. (This review appears at the beginning of the review)\n\n\n\"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" has had a hard life, not only being the shortest movie in the series, and being the only one with a running time under three hours, but also the only one in which Mr. Parker, the actor of the show, leaves the show after the third season. But, what made the long wait all the more painful is that the film was delayed in its initial release because Comedy Central decided to replace Mr. Parker with Mr. Miller. When Mr. Parker returned to the television channel, a year later, the rest just seems to have passed. There is a reason why South Park has had such a great relationship with comedy in general. It is because it doesn't need to be anything more than a smart joke. This film doesn't have to be any other way, there are only so many times the writers need to use the words \"I've made a dick of myself,\" or \"You f***kwit!\" I'll be honest, the word \"hilarious\" is used a lot in South Park; and with all the stupid, stupid, stupid situations that the show has introduced over the years, I'm not surprised by this. This movie, however, is so much more than just funny, it's just plain gross.\n\n\nWhile the plot of \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" is quite simple, the movie does a very good job developing the characters. If \"South Park\" had been made around 2000, I might still suggest that it was a good film on its own. As it is however, the film features two very",

    "This is an adaptation of Charles Xavier's story as told in his own words by those who knew him most intimately. The young Jean Grey first met her future mentor, then known under many different aliases, during World War II and she never saw him again after he had left Utopia to join Xavier's fledgling School for Gifted Youngsters (SGY) on Utopia, New Jersey. It was there, however - upon being introduced to Scott Summers and Bobby Drake - that they were initiated into Mutants. During their time together - during which Jean went from merely a friend to something of a potential love interest/wife/daughter relationship as well - Jean found herself at times compelled to perform acts outside of her normal moral code, including lying, stealing, violence and even murder. When asked why her fellow X-Men would take steps that led to the death of another X-Man, Psylocke answers \"I don't know. It just happened.\" After escaping an attack from Magneto's Brotherhood, her powers manifested once more, allowing her to control magnetism, gravity and movement of living organisms. This same ability prompted her escape from the clutches of Mister Sinister but proved to be one of her deadliest liabilities thereafter when she suddenly vanished out of the sky after performing a somersault with telekinesis as she fought off assassins attempting to kill Captain America. Despite such problems and doubts, Jean continued to fight alongside the team from the shadows against Professor Xavier himself while still living openly within her civilian life of being the editor of her brother's school newspaper The Shi'ar Star. However, as she wrestled with her identity among the world's super heroes the world began to unravel around her because her powers gradually grew stronger, causing her increasingly erratic behavior, until eventually mutating her brain (the result of an experiment gone horribly wrong involving her own X-Gene). As her brain morphed deeper in to chaos, so did her personality and abilities become drastically altered as she became much more violent and bloodthirsty. Though this form seemed alien to humans on earth, it was much of what was familiar in Jean: she is empathic, selfless, loyal and fearless. Ultimately though, mutantkind will always choose love over hate, and even if Xavier chose to destroy Jean outright he left a legacy that has now been inherited by children all across the galaxy as seen across both movies.

    "\"There are no real monsters as such, only the human heart that creates them.\" There's this idea about zombies — they're just things we fear and then we put more flesh on it, but actually there never was any kind of humanoid living dead at all (we can't make out the details because the footage used in these films always has actors on horseback or walking along a track); people were probably scared by stories like Dracula until maybe halfway through the 1800s, so those ideas have long been around. So I'm wondering if somebody who writes books about vampires might be able to go back into their library and find some old Dracula novels, just seeing if there was anybody interested when that stuff came out. Because these movies don't seem to exist for very long, and obviously it takes years and decades until a film gets greenlit, right? And if they didn't try hard enough to get it made now... but anyway it seems you wouldn't want to go looking for that sort of thing by going back and researching old vampire books. If I went back and started exploring medieval fantasy novels when it started coming up on the market, that would actually lead me down the wrong path, but perhaps it would lead me on up the right one, that there wasn't some great big secret civilization inside all of us called humanity that could produce an unstoppable monster out of thin air. At least not within the last 20 years, if not longer. And that is something we're trying to come to terms with in our own relationship to reality. People are getting older, aging becomes increasingly visible, but nobody thinks death doesn't happen; they think death is something we can wait for, something that will happen when you've finally got enough health insurance and food stamps and financial security. But that way of thinking about reality is really deeply flawed and doesn't have much practical significance for how we live our lives, especially life expectancy. We know life expectancy in America is declining, yes, it will be zero by 2050. There'll be fewer Americans alive then than were alive in 1783, which had an infant mortality rate nearly twenty times higher than ours today. That tells you how shortsighted it is to keep focusing on your lifespan as some ultimate goal, to focus on what age, as in fifty-something, eighty-five, whatever it is you're aiming for or hoping to achieve. Of course even though death was once thought to",
    "This film has been called \"the greatest musical ever made.\" It's not just that it's one of the most popular movies in history, but also because it was so well-made and so beautifully acted. The story follows the lives of two families as they travel through Europe during World War II. The music is beautiful and haunting, with some of the best songs ever written. This film is an absolute must see!\n\nI have to admit I didn't know much about this movie before watching it. But after seeing it, I'm glad I did. The soundtrack alone makes this movie worth seeing. There are many great songs in this movie, including \"My Favorite Things,\" \"It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas,\" \"You're So Vain,\" \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow,\" \"A Little Night Music,\" \"When You Wish Upon A Star,\" \"We Three Kings,\" \"Let It Snow,\" \"Oh What A Beautiful Mornin',\" \"What Child Is This?\" and \"All By Myself.\"\n\nThere are several scenes where you can hear the music playing in the background. For example, when the characters are walking down the street, there is a scene where the music plays while they walk by a church. Another scene features the music playing on a piano at the end of the movie.

    "This film is about two men who are trying to make it in Hollywood, but they have very different ideas on how to do so. One man wants to be an actor and the other wants to be a producer. They both get their chance when one of them gets hired by a major studio to produce a new musical. The problem is that neither of them knows what he's doing. He doesn't know how to write music or choreograph a dance number. And she doesn't know how to direct a scene. But they're determined to succeed because they believe in themselves.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a good movie or not. I think it could have been better had the director chosen to focus more on the characters rather than just the plot. It also seems like there was too much emphasis put on the actors' performances. There were some great scenes with the actors, but most of the time they seemed to be talking over each other. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does take away from the overall experience.\n\nOverall Rating: 3/5",

    "\"This is an ambitious film from director David Greig (Laggies) and it's directed with subtlety, skill and precision… This might be my favorite sports movie of 2014.\" (Mark Kermode)\n\nIn 2014, after two years of anticipation, Sports Illustrated released its list of the 100 Best Sports Movies Ever made. With only one exception—one that no football fan can ignore without having to give up a night and change their plans—no writer seemed to have anything bad to say about any one of them. You could make an argument either way as to which are true or not true. But what makes this list so significant is that nearly every movie here is in the top five! And even on some of those rare occasions when they're at the bottom, they still got there because most of these guys were really fucking talented. So why do I think more people will like watching sports movies than ever before? Because almost everyone involved with making them has finally gotten into television production.\n\nIt was around ten years ago when sports was dying off and sports media executives decided that instead there should be big business opportunities for their product in front-page newspaper articles, on nightly TV news shows, in magazine features, by major sponsors etc.—but you couldn't call them movies. Yes, even when they tried to claim that they were movie directors with a bit of a penchant for Hollywood films, they failed miserably. Then came the golden age of moviemaking—the one we know today as the new Golden Age of Television. Since that time, everything a big sports movie did or said in order to promote themselves on television was done within a year. They realized that if they didn't produce them now, somebody else would.\n\nAll of the biggest stars who became household names during that era in sports culture simply couldn't exist on a monthly pay check and so in pursuit of profit, they turned all of these talented individuals into entertainment icons through successful sports franchises and/or endorsement deals within these businesses. Today you see commercials, documentaries & even movie trailers for companies, teams and athletes' products being filmed, edited and approved on the fly within just days by a team of producers inside studios in Los Angeles and New York. That's right; they don't take ten months to pull together but within a day they have a finished product ready to go and even then they're able to fine tune things",
    "\"Dark City\" (2014)\n\nDirected and Written by Sam Rockwell, Story By: Sam Rockwell\n\nStarring: Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Danny DeVito, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael C. Hall, Michelle Pfeiffer\n\n\"Dark City,\" a drama about the drug trade, violence, and death in a city in the process of being destroyed, was directed and written by Samuel L. Jackson, and stars Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito. The film has also been criticized by some as being unrealistic and even disturbing (I will get to this in more detail below). But at its heart this is an exciting and emotional story that makes some interesting choices about the way we look at the world. The film is based on a controversial novel, \"The Corner\", and while there is no doubt that the movie can be very, very good or very, very bad (I'm very interested in knowing what Sam Rockwell was thinking when he decided to work with a screenwriter with no prior film experience), it doesn't matter. We are looking at a terrific film, one of those rare moments where a film really does feel like a work of art, even in a genre that is filled with so much crap.\n\nThe film is set in New York City, where the drug trade is a vicious business. The film begins by putting us on film as an anonymous young man who is forced into taking part in a brutal scheme to obtain the product of a particularly violent drug lord, nicknamed \"The Ghost\". The film then follows the man on his descent into the dirty, violent world. However, he isn't the only outsider, as we meet other people trying to survive on their own. It is often difficult to imagine the scale and brutality of violence on film and in this film that feeling comes through in overwhelming and brutal detail. The violence in this film, even more so than in other recent gangster flicks, is not presented as a comic book-like spectacle, but as very close to the reality.\n\nThe film seems to have been made in an interesting way. We are introduced to the world, and its characters, as a man is trying to navigate the world he has gotten used to living in and trying to figure out why he isn't able to trust anyone. He has been using his wealth,",
    "\"We've got the perfect combination–a pair of buddies (the two brothers, Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Reynolds) who play cops on their way home from vacation after an intense day spent chasing people in the city (they were chased down by drug dealers), all while searching for more clues to solve their case. It's pure comedic joy with these guys! I just adore Benicio Del Toro, both mentally and physically; he brings great energy to this flick!\" – Scott Frank (Director), Brian Rafferty, Joe Berlinger (Screenwriter), Robert Schwentke (Actor), Michael Zegenberger (Actor). \"I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!!! My friend said it would be awesome to see a sequel if there was one – so naturally I went nuts buying posters and T-shirts, hoping someone could produce one!! You can't go wrong with anything they've done…and most importantly you have to keep them drunk at night….\" – David Ehrlich (Writer) – IMDB Reviewer.\n\n\nStay tuned through July 23rd for our official trailer for \"Goodnight, And Good Luck!\".

    "In this film, we follow the life and career of actor Robert Downey Jr., who has been in over 100 films since his debut in \"A Bronx Tale.\" The film follows him as he tries to make it big in Hollywood while dealing with personal issues such as drug addiction, depression, and alcoholism. He also deals with the pressures of fame and the pressure of being married to one of the most beautiful women on earth.\n\nThis film was directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Zodiac) and stars Downey Jr. as himself, alongside Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Don Cheadle, and Samuel L. Jackson. It's based on the book \"Inside Man,\" written by Michael Lewis.\n\nI'm not sure if I would have liked this movie more than the first two installments of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but I do think that it does a good job at capturing the essence of what makes Downey so great. This is a very well-written story about an actor trying to find his way in the world. There are some interesting character moments throughout the film, which I enjoyed watching unfold.\n\nOverall, I thought this was a solid movie. I did enjoy the ending, though.",
    "A train runs a little over three miles (four kilometers) from Seoul to Busan, but it will make a shorter trip for some of your colleagues in the movie, Train to Busan, now available on DVD for the first time in 13 years.\n\nK-Pop girl group Girls' Generation, led by singer and songwriter Jessica, is given a gift-wrapped train, loaded with the latest in technology as the newest member, Hani, meets it at The Seoul Metro. The other members and staff are skeptical at first, as the train is not on schedule but has a ticket, and there are a lot of people on the train, causing many to want to switch seats. But as Hani moves forward, she begins to understand the \"value\" of such a train with her special, unique set of abilities, a gift she brings along from her childhood in Japan. After the passengers get into the train, Hani explains further on the value of train travel as a way for people of all interests, talents and abilities to connect, to have fun and to have some fun together.\n\nThe film doesn't have a plot, but it's clear that the movie is all about people and their love and connection to the train, through the characters, who share their love for trains. The relationships of the main characters (Chaeyoo, Daehoon and Namjeong) and the staff members are more meaningful and more real, like in the movie, than in real life. There are scenes on the train with many emotions: a mother and daughter who are waiting for their train, couples, families, kids and friends. Some scenes are more dramatic, like a conversation between the conductor and a pregnant woman, and it's shown that many women like to have a train waiting for them at home to get them home quicker.\n\nThe characters are diverse and diverse, and the relationship between different characters from different age groups and culture is really moving. This includes the main Korean characters, although Chae Young-joon, also known throughout the world as Super Junior's Sulli, does have the advantage of being the youngest child in the movie. He and his friends all have different characters that they want to know more about, but we are also able to feel love and the need to live life and not die young.

    "The Adjustment Bureau from The Adjustment Bureau directed by Greg Yaitanes and starring John Cho is an action-comedy starring John Cho, Emma Stone, Amy Poehler, and Jeff Daniels. The film opens with a brief introduction by a TV news reporter, discussing the recent death of a famous artist. This news story leads to us to a high-rise downtown office building filled with two dozen employees who are taking on the job of keeping a lid on the recent murders of a number of young women in the area. Of the dozen or so young women employed as the 'Adjustment Bureau,' they include Jessica, a beautiful young artist who has been kidnapped and murdered; Rachel, who is also beautiful; and two others, who are missing. As they spend most of the film together, the two women who are still missing have no idea that something is awry until one of them finds a set of keys that fits her missing cell phone.\n\nThe Adjustment Bureau is a story of personal revenge. The film portrays the two victims as two outcast personalities (Jessica and Rachel), who are both forced onto the job because they can't earn it with their talents. As their skills are quickly used or wasted, the members of the Adjustment Bureau come to resent the women who are actually helping. This creates friction between all of them. Meanwhile, the real villains – the criminals – seem to be in the office. At the very end of the film, we learn that the two women are in fact \"the Adjustment Bureau.\" This adds a layer of intrigue to the film, in which you do not know who the antagonist is, nor do you know if he or she is the actual killer. In the end, I was quite entertained.\n\nThe biggest weakness of The Adjustment Bureau is the acting. Rachel is barely able to hold her own without the assistance of a stunt double. The women are forced to perform their own stunts, without any background or practice. The movie also makes a big deal out of \"sex appeal,\" but this also does not come into play until the last fifteen minutes. With two female leads, the female characters should be more fleshed out.\n\nI will admit to loving the soundtrack from Michael Giacchino. I would have preferred to have seen it in 3.1 surround sound instead of 4.1. Most of the action scenes are impressive in their",

He must now fight to survive against the alien invaders while trying to find out what happened to his wife and daughter. The story follows the astronaut's journey through space and time, with some scenes being shot in outer space. This film has a lot of action sequences, but it also has a good amount of humor. It is not very long, so you can watch this movie in one sitting. There are many different endings, which makes it hard to decide which ending you should see. Overall, I think this is a great movie.",
    "Although Marvel Studios released its first Spider-man film in 2002, in 2007 Sony Pictures announced that it was bringing Spidey to life with three new movies set within the MCU (movies and TV shows with ties to superheroes). Although all have received somewhat mixed reviews this does not impact my review as I am reviewing the latest installment in the series written by director Jon Watts who also co-wrote the screenplay. However, one can't help but wonder if there could be an even larger change happening at Universal, with Warners still holding on to rights since The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Let's take a look… SPIDER-MAN UNSOLVERED AND THE MECHANICAL INMATES OF SANDY FURY There is little doubt that fans will remember Eddie Brock aka Silk in his previous incarnation, now known simply as The Lizard. Peter Parker gets off quite easily though, which has been the issue for the character since he moved away in high school over a decade ago. Peter went back to college only to discover Brock had changed into Venom! He must learn how to cope without being Spider-Man when his alter ego's evil sister, Shathra (Michelle Lukert) kidnaps Aunt May (Marisa Tomei)! If this sounds like familiar material you'll probably recall that James Cameron's third installment of this universe, T2, featured The Sinister Six as part of the same storyline (the team disbanded after their brief, successful tenure). On top of that Venom becomes involved once again when Mary Jane takes to the streets looking for him! She joins Spidey's old foe Electro (Jamie Foxx), Mac Gargan (Jon Favreau) and her longtime friend Felicia Hardy (Sarah Gadon) into a hunt to apprehend the symbiotically bonded creature before it destroys New York City completely! This may seem like a large spoiler but as long as Peter isn't actively doing anything that threatens humanity what more harm will he do? As is with all Marvel films The Spectacular Spider-Man has great cast members so getting to know everyone's favorite web crawler is important. Luckily there are plenty of newcomers including Amber Heard as Mary Jane and Martin Sheen in this installment (he played the villainous Norman Osborn in previous films) to make their first appearance here. Fortunately those familiar with the character's past will feel right at home throughout. It seems Spide",
    "I saw this film on opening night and I had trouble sleeping, but then again it's impossible not to when you are surrounded by so much beautiful light and color that permeates this picture. The cinematography was gorgeous at all times, from the sun streaming through the windows to Ford (Clive Owen), a British mechanic who runs a little auto shop just outside his home town but has spent much of his life in racing circles, working on big cars around Europe and elsewhere, including a F1 car during his stint with Williams as a reserve driver in 1996. He wins a Formula Renault Championship later that year and moves up into a seat next to Nigel Mansell within a year, becoming the first man ever to win both categories simultaneously before qualifying to finish second in that race. There are some beautiful moments in this one, as is often the case during this kind of movie — they're few and far between though, being mostly about the speed you can hit on a racetrack compared to how good the human body looks after suffering injury or having to deal with a catastrophic motor failure. We get to experience both at work — driving for Williams' mechanic sidekick Colin Bonneterre during the French Grand Prix in 1997 while he races with an engine problem; taking part in multiple pit stops without letting up during a season in which three different mechanics got hurt (one actually died in this movie). Then there are the more emotional scenes throughout the year, specifically those involving Paul Newman's character, Wayne Palmer, whose father is killed in an accident two years previously. To put it bluntly, I am not alone when I say my heart sunk when I saw Palmer crying for the last time, as much emotion was injected into this movie. But I always felt that all the emotions were balanced so well between everyone involved that there was really something else going on for the characters besides that tear or that anguish over their loved ones dying in such terrible ways. Even though I feel people will sometimes miss the point, there was no denying the quality in that film in the final analysis, especially for a non-technical audience like myself. If nothing else, I do see parallels between this and some real world tragedies going on right now, if they weren't addressed clearly enough by Nolan earlier on. While this may read somewhat harsh, you can only consider everything objectively the way you intend. Sure, we don't know where these characters came from back then,",
    "A young man named David (Tom Hanks) and his girlfriend, Jennifer (Jennifer Connelly), are on their way to visit her parents in New York City when they get lost in an alternate universe where Earth has been destroyed by aliens. They end up stranded in this world with no memory of how they got there or what happened to them. The only clue that they have is a mysterious book called \"Across the Universe,\" which contains a map that leads them back home. But as they begin to piece together the clues, they realize that the book may be more than just a guidebook; it could hold the key to saving humanity.\n\nThis film was directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg. It stars Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, John Goodman, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, and Christopher Lloyd.",
    "This film was directed by Shane Black, who has made some of my favorite films in recent years (see: The Nice Guys). It's also one of his most personal and emotional movies to date. I'm not sure if it's because he's been dealing with the death of his father or what, but this movie is very much about family. And that's something that can be difficult to deal with when you're growing up. But Black does an excellent job at making us care about Tony Stark's relationship with his parents. He doesn't just show them as people we should love, but as people we need to love. They are both flawed characters, but they have their own flaws too. Their relationship is complicated and sometimes painful, but it's still beautiful. This is a great example of how to make a character complex without being boring.\n\nI think the best thing about this movie is that it shows how important family is. We see how important it is to have someone to lean on when times get tough. We see how important it is to have someone to talk to when things aren't going well. We see how important it is to have someone to look out for you when you're young. We see how important it is to have someone to help you through your teenage years. We see how important it is to have someone to take care of you when you're old. And we see how important it is to have someone to protect you when you're dead. That's why I loved this movie so much. It showed how important family is. It showed how important it is to have someone to lean on when times get tough.

    "If you haven't seen this yet, this will be your first exposure to Tedd Marshall and Amanda Seyfried (Star Search). Not many people had seen either working together previously since the mid-1990's on Star Search 2. Both actresses were known nationally but largely unknown in terms of their career trajectories until they came into the scene with Ted and it was then that both ladies brought out the best in each other and made them each stars. They are real lovers (even sharing same room) with chemistry between the characters the characters are meant always feel. The movie takes place primarily over two seasons as the two meet again and try to deal with divorce (and it does not get light and happy from here on), raising a boy, some family problems, and having to juggle the demands of their careers. This film features two phenomenal performances so if you can get past the typical rom-com tropes it has some unique charms going for it. What makes this film stand alone as being exceptional though is its very human drama elements that allow the audience to connect more intimately with Tedd and his story than most films in this genre. As we see throughout the movie, Tedd comes off like the loveable idiot but his actions and behavior make up for the flaws he shows us around him. At the end of it all they face up to how far down the rabbit hole of life they have fallen and after the breakup they really do come back together – just barely.\n\n\nTeddy Roosevelt once said that: \"Duty, honor, country, I don't care which.\" If these words could be paraphrased on a T-shirt of Tedd Marshall & Amanda Seyfried's you certainly would give it a lot of thought since those are themes throughout this one movie. Their relationship transcends all social barriers between the worlds of love/hate, celebrity, family, business, fame and politics in a truly great fashion and gives even non-fans plenty of laughs whilst feeling genuine sympathy from some people you know who don't take themselves too seriously. One of my favorite parts to this film is the contrast and juxtaposition of their personal lives at work/family, as well as enjoying the little things around them like sports or simply sitting in front of a screen. The two play by different rules due to their respective paths, however still have much in common because they are both humans and we need love more and than anything else",
    "Directed by George Lucas, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (1996) told the story of Anakin Skywalker from his birth in 34 BBY up to his death at the hands of Darth Vader in 19 BBY. The film was a massive hit at the box office and proved to be quite lucrative with a worldwide gross of $400 million. The film has been re-released in select theaters after the original release and, for the first time, was released on DVD. George Lucas has made several changes to the film in between its initial release and its reissue in 1995, including an alteration of the ending where Vader killed Anakin on Geonosis. Lucas has even gone as far as to claim that he wrote the final ending himself. While he might be justified in claiming all these things, Lucas has stated that he did not change the film after it was completed and only began editing it as it became a more serious picture rather than just a simple campy action film.\n\nIt looks like this is a remake of the 1999 Revenge of the Sith trailer. However, this one does look much much better."
