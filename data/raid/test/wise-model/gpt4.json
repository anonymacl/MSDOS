    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type. This\ndevelops work of Uhlenbeck, Segal, and Burstall-Guest to non-compact inner\nsymmetric spaces. To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity. This provides a straightforward way to construct all such harmonic\nmaps.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",
    "Deep neural networks have achieved satisfactory performance in piles of\nmedical image analysis tasks. However the training of deep neural network\nrequires a large amount of samples with high-quality annotations. In medical\nimage segmentation, it is very laborious and expensive to acquire precise\npixel-level annotations. Aiming at training deep segmentation models on\ndatasets with probably corrupted annotations, we propose a novel Meta Corrupted\nPixels Mining (MCPM) method based on a simple meta mask network. Our method is\ntargeted at automatically estimate a weighting map to evaluate the importance\nof every pixel in the learning of segmentation network. The meta mask network\nwhich regards the loss value map of the predicted segmentation results as\ninput, is capable of identifying out corrupted layers and allocating small\nweights to them. An alternative algorithm is adopted to train the segmentation\nnetwork and the meta mask network, simultaneously. Extensive experimental\nresults on LIDC-IDRI and LiTS datasets show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches which are devised for coping with corrupted\nannotations.",

    "  It is an important task to faithfully evaluate the perceptual quality of\noutput images in many applications such as image compression, image restoration\nand multimedia streaming. A good image quality assessment (IQA) model should\nnot only deliver high quality prediction accuracy but also be computationally\nefficient. The efficiency of IQA metrics is becoming particularly important due\nto the increasing proliferation of high-volume visual data in high-speed\nnetworks. We present a new effective and efficient IQA model, called gradient\nmagnitude similarity deviation (GMSD). The image gradients are sensitive to\nimage distortions, while different local structures in a distorted image suffer\ndifferent degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore the use of\nglobal variation of gradient based local quality map for overall image quality\nprediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity (GMS)\nbetween the reference and distorted images combined with a novel pooling\nstrategy the standard deviation of the GMS map can predict accurately\nperceptual image quality.

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic. Edges are constructed by\ndividing image into different catchment basins with the help of a membership\nfunction. Finally closed contour algorithm is applied to find closed regions\nand objects within closed regions are segmented using intensity information.\nThe performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated both objectively as well\nas subjectively.

For comparative analysis, various comparison\nmethods are used for demonstrating the superiority of proposed methods over\nexisting segmentation methods.",
    "  The effects of residual amplitude modulation (RAM) in laser interferometers\nusing heterodyne sensing can be substantial and difficult to mitigate. In this\nwork, we analyze the effects of RAM on a complex laser interferometer used for\ngravitational wave detection.

This shift causes variations in\nthe sensing matrix, and leads to degradation in the performance of the\nprecision noise subtraction scheme of the multiple-degree-of-freedom control\nsystem. In addition, such detuned optical cavities produce an opto-mechanical\nspring, which also varies the sensing matrix.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

To efficiently process video, we propose 3D separable\nconvolution for the pyramid pooling module and decoder, which dramatically\nreduces the number of operations while maintaining the performance. Moreover,\nwe also extend our framework to video action segmentation by adding an extra\nclassifier to predict the action label for actors in videos.

Our generative\nadversarial network based model works on a conditional probability approach.\nThis approach makes the image translation independent of any local, global and\ncontent or style features. In our approach we use a bidirectional\nreconstruction model appended with the affine transform factor that helps in\nconserving the content and photorealism as compared to other models. The\nadvantage of using such an approach is that the image-to-image translation is\nsemi-supervised, independant of image segmentation and inherits the properties\nof generative adversarial networks tending to produce realistic. This method\nhas proven to produce better results than Multimodal Unsupervised\nImage-to-image translation.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets. It also\noutperforms state-of-the-art edge detection methods on NYU depth dataset and\nachieves state-of-the-art on Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS 500).",
    "Current state-of-the-art methods for image segmentation form a dense image\nrepresentation where the color, shape and texture information are all processed\ntogether inside a deep CNN. This however may not be ideal as they contain very\ndifferent type of information relevant for recognition. Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes benchmark, in terms of both mask\n(mIoU) and boundary (F-score) quality, improving by 2% and 4% over strong\nbaselines.",
    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions. Our proof confirms recent numerical findings that already\nhinted at this convergence. Furthermore we offer a thorough mathematical\nunderpinning for networks of so-called theta neurons, where the OA ansatz has\njust been applied. In a final step we extend our proof by allowing for\ntime-dependent and multi-dimensional parameters as well as for network\ntopologies other than global coupling. This renders the OA ansatz an excellent\nstarting point for the analysis of a broad class of realistic settings.\n",
    "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the non-invasive modality of choice for\nbody tissue composition analysis due to its excellent soft tissue contrast and\nlack of ionizing radiation.

When she thinks her two children do not need her any longer, Lila Schwartz, a sexually active woman, leaves behind her family, calls herself Lila Munroe and moves to California, where she trains, and later works, as a lawyer. Faced with the dual challenge of having to raise two teenage kids while remaining successful in his demanding job as a publicist and speech writer, Bernard Schwartz more and more relies on medication to cope with everyday life. The real trouble begins when he accidentally swallows two incompatible antidepressants and falls into a coma shortly thereafter. While he is unconscious Bernard Schwartz has a stroke. When he wakes up again he is seriously handicapped&mdash;his speech is slurred, his walk is unsteady and his memory is permanently impaired. Similar to a child, he has to learn the meanings of many words. Instead of going to school, Chris teaches his father as best as he can. In spite of his enforced preoccupation with his \"sleeping\" father, Chris Schwartz notices that his own life goes on without any major change. Still a virgin, he fantasizes about having sex with Lisa Danmeyer, Bernard's neurologist and actually has his first sexual encounter ever at his father's rehab centre with a sexy speech pathologist who performs fellatio on him. At the same time Cathy, his 16 year-old sister, is on the brink of abandoning her Jewish roots and converting to Roman Catholicism. However, she also develops a crush on Francis Dial, her brother's best friend and classmate. Chris cannot believe that his younger sister might have sex before he does, but in the end this is exactly what happens, an unwanted teenage pregnancy being the result of their union. At first the young lovers are unsure whether Cathy should have an abortion or not, but Cathy soon makes up her mind to keep the baby.",
    " The school has been run since its inception ten years earlier by two elderly educators, Mabel Edge and Hermione Baker, who are regarded by many as old spinsters hopelessly out of touch with reality, especially with what their teenage charges really think and feel. The 300 or so students are virtually indistinguishable from one another, a fact which is stressed by their names all starting with the letter M: Margot, Marion, Mary, Melissa, Merode, Midget, Mirabel, Moira. Their budding but suppressed sexuality&mdash;they are all between 16 and 18 years of age and \"going to be attractive\"&mdash;is constantly alluded to in the novel. (\"They're only children, the girls I mean, and sex is unconscious at their age. It's such a temptation for a man.\") Of the teaching staff, only few characters are mentioned. There is Miss Winstanley, young, colourless, and secretly in love with one of the few male teachers at the academy, economics tutor Sebastian Birt. Birt, however, a short and stout man in his late twenties, is having an affair with Elizabeth Rock, a 35 year-old woman recovering from a nervous breakdown who temporarily also lives on the school grounds, in her grandfather's cottage. That man, 76 year-old Mr Rock, is a retired scientist who has been granted the privilege to live there for the remainder of his life for past services rendered to the State. The aging Rock, who is referred to as \"the sage\" by some (including the narrator) and as \"Gapa\" by his granddaughter, spends his time mainly with, and for, his pets&mdash;his albino sow, Daisy, his cat, Alice, and his goose, Ted. He describes himself as \"a bit stiff about the joints these days\", he has some difficulty climbing steps, has poor eyesight, is deaf in one ear and almost deaf in the other, and has recently had problems with his memory. In addition, one of his idiosyncrasies consists in putting all the post he gets in a big trunk without opening any of it, ever. Edge, one of the principals, has for some time wanted to thoroughly \"spring-clean\" the whole place and get rid of Rock, his granddaughter, and Birt, partly in order to secure the sage's cottage for the use of additional school staff. In other matters, she is more hesitant. When in the morning some girls report Mary and Merode missing, pointing out that neither of their beds has been slept in, Edge turns out to be very reluctant to use the official channels to inform relatives, the school supervisor, or the local police. Naturally it occurs to her and her colleague Baker that Mary and Merode might have eloped with two young men (\"At the station much of their time was taken up with young women adrift, who, after fourteen days, returned brown and happy from a fortnight with a boy by the ocean.\"), but, rather than fearing the worst, they assume the girls will be back for that night's entertainment, a ball in honour of the academy's founder&mdash;without men of course. At the same time Edge turns down some of the staff's requests to be allowed to go swimming in the nearby lake, which is interpreted as a sure sign that one of the girls' bodies could turn up any time floating in the water. In the course of the day, especially where Rock is involved, lots of people talk at cross-purposes, deliberately as well as accidentally misunderstanding what others are saying, in many instances only hinting at facts or, worse, spreading rumours. Around noon Merode is found, right on the compound but somewhat dazed, under a fallen beech in the vicinity of Rock's cottage&mdash;the very beech tree used by Sebastian Birt and Elizabeth Rock when they want to have some fun. According to school regulations, Merode must not be interrogated before she has submitted a written statement about what has happened, and she is immediately locked away for her own good. The rest of the afternoon is mainly taken up with preparations for the dance. As usual, the Founder's Day Ball is held without any guests from outside the school. However, Rock and his granddaughter turn up unexpectedly but appropriately dressed, without having been invited by anyone. While Mary is still missing (the reader never learns where she is or what has happened to her), Elizabeth Rock and Sebastian Birt start dancing together cheek to cheek and, generally, appear glued to each other, a \"display of animalism\" Edge is not willing to put up with any longer. Almost at the end of her tether, she secretly indulges in a cigarette or two in her office. Meanwhile Mr Rock is accosted by several of the girls who first want to dance with him and later drag him downstairs into the cellar of the building where they take turns kissing him and where they introduce him to the \"Institute Inn\", their secret club. Although Rock initially enjoys the girls' attentions, he quickly becomes appalled by their lack of morals and leaves the \"club.\" He comes upon his nemesis, Miss Edge, but after his experiences with the girls he is more sympathetic to her difficulties maintaining order at the school. For her part, Edge is impressed with the courtly bearing Rock has affected in the Ball's formal setting and also consumed by a tobacco-fueled lassitude. The two older adults have a pleasant conversation which comes to a head when Edge, almost without realizing, finds herself proposing marriage to Rock. The sage is astounded, and politely but firmly rejects her suggestion. He then leaves the ball and returns home to his animals. At the end of the day no one has reached any conclusions, and everything remains undecided.",

The principal claims that she did this to ensure they were wearing proper attire for the school dance. She also claims that her job is not only to ensure they get a proper education, but that they also grow into proper ladies and do not become sluts. She sends several girls home for wearing slutty panties. Although there is no crime to charge her with, Jesse determines to make trouble for her until he can find something to charge her with as he is convinced the girls’ civil rights were violated. He begins interviewing the principal along with her high powered attorney husband, as well as the girls. Later one of the girls comes to see Jesse at his office. She tells him that her parents are swingers, and often host parties for that purpose at their home. She and her little brother hate it and she asks Jesse if he can help. With swinging not illegal, Jesse finds his hands tied, but decides to investigate anyway. He has Suit talk to two of the women, one of whom he knew in high school, to get more information on the swingers club. Suit discovers that the girl’s mother is not into it, but only does it because her husband wants to. Jesse has Spike threaten her husband about the swinging, and she later leaves him. The main plot of the novel involves the investigation of the Night Hawk. The Night Hawk starts as a peeping tom, and the Paradise police get several calls about him. Later the Night Hawk escalates his voyeuristic attacks by breaking into homes while women are home alone, forcing them to undress at gunpoint, and then taking nude photos of them. He then begins writing Jesse detailing his exploits, and includes the nude photos. He writes that he cannot stop himself; he must discover these women’s “secret.” He also writes that he does not know what he will do next and fears that he will escalate further. Jesse begins to combine his investigation of the swingers with his investigation of the Night Hawk. Since the Night Hawk never touches anyone, he questions the swingers to find out if there is anyone in their club that only likes to watch and never touch. The women in the club all identify Seth Ralston. Ralston is a professor of English at a nearby university. He is married to a young grad student who is working on her doctorate. Jesse discovers that Ralston's wife used to teach a Wednesday night class, which corresponds with all the peeping tom reports. He also discovers that the peeping tom reports stopped at the same time that Ralston’s wife quit her teaching job to begin doing her doctoral work full time. Jesse questions Ralston’s wife about the swinging to see if she will inadvertently reveal something about her husband that will confirm he is the Night Hawk, and even hints to her that her husband may be the Night Hawk. She responds by belittling Jesse for being a dumb cop, and singling them out for their lifestyle. Meanwhile Jesse continues to pressure Betsy Ingersoll, who then reports that she is a victim of the Night Hawk. Soon after Jesse receives a nude photo of Betsy, however he and Molly become convinced that she is posing in the photo and suspect the attack was staged. The local media request an interview concerning the attack, and Jesse uncharacteristically agrees. He gives details of the attack and later receives a letter from the Night Hawk who demands that he never attacked Betsy Ingersoll. Jesse believes that the Night Hawk is telling the truth, as he has never denied an attack before, but always been honest about his attacks. Jesse confronts Betsy with this and she admits that she staged the attack. She says that she did it to get some attention from her husband, but that he did not even care. She was acting out because her husband cheats on her constantly with young women, which also explains her obsession with teenage girls not growing up to be sluts. Jesse agrees not to charge her with any crimes if she agrees to see Sunny Randall’s shrink, Dr. Silverman (the long-term love interest of another Parker character Spenser), which she does. A few days later Seth Ralston’s wife comes to Jesse to report that her husband is missing. They begin searching for him, and soon after Jesse receives another letter from the Night Hawk blasting him for speaking with his wife, and ruining his life. He writes that he is going to leave town, but only after he discovers one more woman’s secret, as he calls it, and warns that this woman will be someone close to Jesse. Jesse thinks that he is trying to hint that the woman will be Betsy Ingersoll, but Jesse believes he is actually targeting Molly. They set a police unit in front of Betsy’s house as a decoy, but then stake out Molly’s house. Molly waits at home with a gun strapped to her thigh, and a wire so Jesse can hear her. The Night Hawk breaks in on her and forces her to begin stripping at gun point. Suit and Jesse then break in to arrest him. Surprised that they figured out he was after Molly, he raises his gun to shoot her, but Molly, Suit, and Jesse all shoot and kill Seth Ralston, putting an end to the Night Hawk. Suit is left with a moral dilemma that it was his shot that killed Ralston, but since all three fired, Jesse is able to disfuse the situation by convincing Suit that it could have been any one of the three.",
    " The story outlines contact between Earth and the title Visitors, a group of mysterious objects from deep space. The Visitors are simple black oblong boxes, as large as buildings, which approach from space and orbit the Earth before descending to the United States. The nature of the visitors is kept rather mysterious&nbsp;— it's not clear if they are vehicles or living things in their own right. They are apparently unable to communicate with humans in any meaningful way; on one occasion a human is taken inside a Visitor, only to be released after experiencing a jumble of confusing colored lights and smells which he didn't understand. The Visitors are composed largely of a dense form of cellulose, and they proceed to consume a quantity of trees and plant life in the US. Eventually they start producing vehicles, superficially resembling human cars but capable of flying using the same unknown principles as the Visitors themselves, and apparently incorporating some element of intelligence, or at least instinct, since they do not crash into things as they move. The humans assume that the Visitors have created these vehicles as a gift in return for the plant matter which the Visitors are consuming, and the novel touches on the disruption such well-meaning gifts might incur on the Earth's economic systems. Toward the end of the book the Visitors also start producing housing units for humans, and it is even implied that something living may be inside them&nbsp;— perhaps even a Visitor-produced version of humans themselves.",
    " The Republic is decaying, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was elected to save the galaxy from collapsing under the forces of discontent. On the tiny but strategic planet of Ansion, a powerful faction is on the verge of joining the growing Separatist movement. The urban dwellers wish to expand into the prairies outside their cities - the ancestral territory of the fierce, independent Ansion nomads. If their demands are not met, they will secede - an act that could jump-start a chain reaction of withdrawal and rebellion by other worlds of the Republic. At the Chancellor's request, the Jedi Council sends Kenobi and fellow Jedi Luminara Unduli to resolve the conflict and negotiate with the elusive nomads. Undaunted, Kenobi and Unduli, along with their Padawans Skywalker and Barriss Offee, set out across the wilderness. Many perils lie waiting to trap them. The Jedi will have to fulfill near-impossible tasks, befriend wary strangers, and influence two great armies to complete their quest, stalked all the while by an enemy sworn to see the negotiations collapse and the mission fail.",
    " The Land of Little Rain is a collection of short stories and essays detailing the landscape and inhabitants of the American Southwest. A message of environmental conservation and a philosophy of cultural and sociopolitical regionalism loosely links the stories together. ;\"The Land of Little Rain\" The opening essay describes the \"Country of Lost Borders,\" an area of land between Death Valley and the High Sierras. The image created of the land at the beginning of the story is one of almost unbearable heat and dryness, punctuated by violent storms. Despite the description of how inhospitable the landscape is, at the end Austin proposes that the costs the land imposes upon a man are worth it because it provides man with peace of mind and body that cannot be achieved any other way. ;\"Water Trails of the Ceriso\" The section's title refers to the trails made by wild animals moving towards sources of water. The essay provides descriptions of the many animals that travel along the trails, including coyotes, rabbits, and quails. Their ability to find water where there seems to be none is extolled by Austin, a skill which she believes no human is able to match. ;\"The Scavengers\" This essay describes the various animals that live in the desert that feed upon carrion&mdash;most notably, the buzzards and the carrion crows. This scavenging is portrayed as a natural part of the desert, with a multitude of the scavengers working together to find food. The end of the story criticizes the actions of man with regard to the desert. The unnatural trash he leaves cannot used by the scavengers in the story, and as such serves as a stark contrast to the desert's natural processes for recycling waste. ;\"The Pocket Hunter\" A pocket hunter is a type of miner who hunts for pockets of ore deposits. In the story, the pocket hunter described by Mary Austin lives off of the land with minimal interactions with the civilized world. This harmony with nature, Austin argues, is essential to the pocket hunter's simple happiness. Despite Austin's muted praise, the pocket hunter wants to strike it rich in order to move to Europe and mingle with the landed elite, a goal he accomplishes. However, by the end of the story, the pocket hunter returns to the desert since it is his \"destiny\". ;\"Shoshone Land\" \"Shoshone Land\" narrates the experiences of Winnenap', an American Indian medicine man originally from Shoshone Land who was captured by the Paiute tribe. The story initially revolves around Winnenap', but quickly changes to a detailed description of the environment and wildlife of Shoshone Land to form an intimate tie between Winnenap' and the land he formerly inhabited. ;\"Jimville&mdash;a Bret Harte Town\" In the beginning of the section, Jimville is touted as a better source of inspiration for Bret Harte than he found during his own travels. Jimville's inhabitants are likened to the fictional characters that were present in some of Harte's short stories. Austin portrays Jimville as a small town set in a harsh environment and inhabited by simple yet endearing toughs. Although the inhabitants endure many hardships, Austin claims that there is an almost unexplainable pull which keeps them in town and encourages new travelers to stay. ;\"My Neighbor's Field\" The story is about a plot of land which changes hands many times&mdash;Austin characterizes this plot of land as an ideal field. She criticizes the owners of the field, the Indians and shepherds, because their habits and lifestyle scar the land. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that the field is destined to develop into an urban area. Austin claims that while the field may at that point serve a greater human use, it will not be better for the land and all life. ;\"The Mesa Trail\" This section describes one of the trails that runs through the American Southwest. It contains several passages detailing the damage human activity has done to the land. She criticizes the \"unsightly scars\" left by the Paiute Indians in the form of abandoned campoodies and the damaged plant life left by domesticated animals such as sheep. ;\"The Basket Maker\" This story follows the life of Seyavi, a Paiute Indian who loses her mate, lives alone with her child, and sells baskets she weaves in order to survive. Austin claims that the Paiutes make the land itself their home, with the natural ridges of mountains as walls and the wild almond bloom as their furnishings. It is because of this that Austin argues that the Paiutes will always be homesick when in homes built by man, as man cannot replicate nature's walls and furnishings. ;\"The Streets of the Mountains\" This essay consists of long description of mountains and their respective trails. The section characterizes the beauty of the mountains and their inhabitants. The story also contains critiques people who dwell in man-made houses. The comfort provided by such houses, Austin argues, results in people not being able to truly understand the beauty and divinity of the mountains. ;\"Water Borders\" The essay revolves around the streams and lakes that can be found in the mountains, generally formed from the melting snow higher in the mountains. The particular mountain in the story is Oppapago, a mountain within the Sierras in a forest reserve. Austin contrasts the mountain landscape to a meadow outside a forest reserve, which lacks color and beauty because it is damaged by the grazing of sheep. ;\"Other Water Borders\" \"Other Water Borders\" is centered more on the plants affected by the water from the mountains, both wild and cultivated. The story begins with a depiction of a squabble between several locals over an irrigation ditch filled by water from the mountains. This is followed by a series of descriptions of the variety of plants that the irrigation ditch allows to thrive. Found within these depictions of plant life is Austin's lament of the complexities of civilization. Austin implies that with the advent of cities and manufactured objects people have lost an innate ability to know what natural remedies may be beneficial or detrimental to one's health. ;\"Nurslings of the Sky\" The \"nurslings of the sky\" are storms, formed in the hills and given almost human characteristics by Austin. The beginning of the story contains an account of the destruction of a town by floods and snow. The blame for the events is not placed on nature, but rather the people whose poorly placed town was destroyed. The story continues with descriptions of storms and their effects upon the wildlife of the area, pausing to explain how the land teaches people things. The story uses the example of a group of Native Americans who learn the use of smoke signals by observing the dust pillars formed by desert winds at the edges of mesas. The end of the story expresses Austin's discontent at how people have dealt with the weather by determining the best seasons to plant crops rather than by musing about the \"eternal meanings of the skies\". ;\"The Little Town of the Grape Vines\" \"The Little Town of Grape Vines,\" or El Pueblo de Las Uvas, tells a story of a simple people living in peace with their environment. With houses made of mud, homemade wine, and gardens to provide the fruits, vegetables, and herbs, the townspeople live a simple life without the complex notions of wealth and class that Austin feels have corrupted much of society. Austin describes the lives of the people living in the town, lives which consist of little more than planting, harvesting, eating, making music, raising children, and dancing. The end of the story is a call back to the simple life exemplified in \"The Little Town of the Grape Vines,\" criticizing those people who are overly obsessed with their own perceived importance in a world where their actions truly matter little.",
    " The book shares the personal stories of several families fighting autism. These stories focus on alternative autism therapies that they try to heal their children, as well as McCarthy's own reminiscing about her autistic child and her outspoken and contentious activism. The book includes the daughter of the founder of Autism Speaks, who claims to have changed her son's diet and improved his autism despite conspiratorial resistance from the organization, which, the book claims, until recently, rejected research into biomedical treatments; a mother who is claimed \"healed\" her son of his autism while taking on breast cancer; a father whose son was officially undiagnosed after allegedly under-going treatment for a laundry list of debilitating autism symptoms and regressions; and a sixty-year-old woman who made attempts to fight to save her son (now thirty) in the 1980s, the book exclaims that she paved the way for the parents of today. The book also features a list of controversial autism resources and a directory of DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!) doctors who are sympathetic to the widely discredited theory that autism is caused by mercury in vaccines.",
    " Azriel is telling the story of his transformation into and subsequent existence as an immortal genii who is forced to obey the Master who calls him. Over centuries, Azriel becomes less obedient to the Masters and a warning is placed on the casket of his bones that he is not to be summoned lest his evil be loosed upon the undeserving world. After many centuries of rest, Azriel finds himself awake and in New York City, a dazed witness to the murder of a young woman, Esther Belkin. He becomes inexplicably obsessed with the desire to avenge her death and to find out who called him into the physical world in time to see Esther die but not in time to save her. This quest leads him to the girl's stepfather, Gregory Belkin, who would pay any price to fulfill his messianic dream via his immense worldwide religious organization, the Temple of the Mind of God. As his quest approaches its climax, he risks his supernatural powers to forestall an attempt to destroy the world thus redeeming what was denied him for so long: his own eternal human soul.",
    " The story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947. Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old. Thursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \"Outland\" to find out what people in the real world think of him. Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenburg cake, has some curious house guests: Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos. Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them. Despite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues. She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the aging English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \"The Windowmaker\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike. Thursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him. On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\"). Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday. Goliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO -- at their headquarters in the Isle of Man -- and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness. Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband. Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilize. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \"stick\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly. On top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final in order to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy). She succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.",
    " Up to this time Cornwell had been going back through the period of the Napoleonic Wars to find new incidents into which to place his hero. Rather than do this, he adopts a \"prequel\" approach and uses an earlier campaign period in the history of the British Army, that of colonial India. The novel opens with Richard Sharpe serving as a private with the British army, then invading Mysore and advancing on the Tippoo Sultan's capital city of Seringapatam. Sharpe is contemplating desertion with his paramour, widow Mary Bickerstaff. His sadistic company sergeant, Obadiah Hakeswill, deliberately provokes Sharpe into attacking him, and engineers the virtual death sentence of 2,000 lashes for the private. But Sharpe is rescued by Lieutenant William Lawford after 200 lashes are inflicted, in order to effect a rescue mission behind the Tippoo's lines. Lawford and Sharpe are ordered to pose as deserters to rescue Colonel Hector McCandless, chief of the British East India Company's intelligence service. Although Lawford is nominally in command, Sharpe quickly dominates the lieutenant by force of personality and, without authorization, brings Mary on the mission. Joining the Tippoo's army, they discover that the Tippoo has set a trap for the invading British by mining the weakest (and thus most inviting) portion of Seringapatam's walls. Before Sharpe and Lawford can discover a way to transmit a warning to the British, they are betrayed by Sergeant Hakeswill. Hakeswill has been captured in battle and the Tippoo orders him made a human sacrifice for victory, but Hakeswill secures the Sultan's mercy in exchange for revealing Sharpe's and Lawford's identity as spies. Sharpe and Lawford are imprisoned as the British army prepares to assault the booby-trapped wall of the city. Mary helps Sharpe to escape, and Sharpe blows up the mine before the main British army can enter the trap. As the Tippoo tries to flee the city, Sharpe finds him in a dark tunnel, kills him, and steals his rich jewels. Sharpe throws Hakeswill to the Tippoo's tigers, but the recently fed animals ignore Hakeswill, and Sharpe's enemy survives to plague him in later adventures.",

    " On Abarrach, Xar is attempting to learn the secret of necromancy, but he needs a corpse to test it on. He interrogates the lazar Kleitus about the location of any living Sartan, and Kleitus reveals that Haplo lied to Xar about all the Sartan dying at the hands of the dead; Balthazar and his group remain living. Kleitus drops a hint about the Seventh Gate, and reveals that it's where the Sundering took place and that Haplo's corpse would know its location. Xar dismisses this idea, as well as the lazar, and is quickly becoming obsessed with the Seventh Gate when receives word that two Sartan have been captured: Zifnab, for one, whose pleas on Haplo's behalf go unheeded; and, as quite a prize, Samah, ruler of the Council of Seven. Xar is initially excited since Samah is the very person who would know the Seventh Gate's location, and he interrogates Samah for it to no avail. Sang-drax&mdash; the one who actually captured Samah and Zifnab&mdash; is summoned by Xar to mentally torture Samah to death; even before he dies, Samah does not reveal anything useful. Xar succeeds in turning him into a far-more-complacent lazar, but too much of Samah's will remains, and he still won't talk. Even worse, when Xar turns his back to investigate Zifnab's disappearance, Jonathan walks in and teaches Samah how to let go; the leader of the Council of Seven is now well and truly dead. Xar is soon told by Sang-drax of Haplo's \"treachery\"; he has helped the mensch start the Kicksey-winsey and given control of Arianus over to the mensch, instead of reserving it for Xar himself. Party to this conversation is the loyal servant who informed Xar of the capture and has already been ordered to investigate the Arianus situation: Marit, the woman Haplo loved, the mother of his child. Xar marries her in traditional Patryn fashion of rune-joining, both to ensure her loyalty and because it gives them an unblockable way to communicate, and then orders her to kill Haplo. Haplo rests on Arianus and tries to heal his heart-rune, a job that truly needs two people (most rune-healing is accomplished by \"circling\" and allowing strength from one person to flow to the other.) Prince Rees'ahn and King Stephen's deputy, the wizard Trian, have come to Drevlin to talk with High Froman Limbeck Bolttightener in the hopes of hammering out some sort of true alliance between all three races of mensch (the mysteriarchs having folded into the human race after their leader Sinistrad's death.) Haplo gives the Kenkari book to Limbeck, and the three races together reactivate the Kicksey-winsey, which realigns the scattered islands of Arianus and starts a constant flow of water through the sky. Then Haplo enters his dragonship and prepares to leave for the last time. Hugh, under contract to kill Haplo, retraces his own steps. He goes from the Cathedral of the Albedo back to the Fortress of the Brotherhood, where Ciang gives him a cursed knife: ugly, badly made, capable of self-movement... and covered in Sartan runes. It is the only weapon the Brotherhood has that might even possibly be capable of killing Haplo. As payment for it, Ciang orders him to never return or further payment will be taken in his blood. Hugh, in the end, doesn't even use his new Cursed Blade&mdash; its main advantage, suppressing Haplo's warning runes and a good amount of his magic, allows Hugh to sneak up on him in his ship and capture him, but the tables turn and Hugh accidentally ends up with Haplo's knife in his gut... only to lurch back from the grave, Alfred's necromancy rune having evidently condemned him to eternal life. Haplo circles with Hugh to calm the human's distress at returning from the dead yet again, and the two begin to plan how to find Alfred when they are interrupted. Marit appears and fights both Haplo and Hugh. The first time they engage their Patryn rune-magic, however, the Cursed Blade reacts, transmuting itself into various threats, and the three break off their conflict periodically to quiet it down (they can't really make it stop;) they also struggle over the ship's steering-stone. Eventually Haplo takes the ship to Chelestra, hoping to douse the Cursed Blade in seawater, but the knife, instead of transforming into another weapon or creature, summons a dragon-snake that destroys the ship. As Haplo drifts in the sea, he hears a voice and looks up to see... Alfred. At Sang-drax's misleading suggestion, Xar has gone to Pryan with the pretext of taming the tytans, and he is frustrated with his inability to reach Marit. His real reason for being there is his hope of finding the Seventh Gate in the citadel that Haplo visited, but he finds little to encourage him. The five mensch&mdash; Paithan, Rega, Aleatha, Roland, and Drugar&mdash; aren't much help, nor is Zifnab, who has somehow gotten here after escaping from Abarrach. Shortly after Xar and Zifnab have arrived, Sang-drax says he knows now that Zifnab is \"one of them;\" after a battle with Zifnab's dragon, he takes on Xar's form and steals the ship, claiming that he will search for Haplo while Xar is on Pryan. It is revealed during Xar's stay that Zifnab is actually one of the dissenting Sartan who refused to go along with Samah's plan; he was among the mensch on Earth during the Sundering, and was the first of either race to escape the Labyrinth. It was he who penned many of the books Xar educated himself with. (With all that Zifnab has seen, his total dementia seems a bit more understandable.) Xar decides to leave Pryan in a ship he spotted outside the citadel, covered in Sartan runes, but to do that he needs to get past the tytans. He decides to need to kill off the mensch and revive them with necromancy to serve as distractions. The mensch are having their own problems. Paithan is obsessed with a room in the center of the citadel that he calls the Star Chamber, a room with seven huge seats and an apparatus that generates blinding light. Roland and Aleatha are mostly not on speaking terms; the elf maiden finds herself spending more time with Drugar, who may be the last of his race. But Drugar has discovered a delightful illusion: at a certain clearing in the garden maze, at certain times of the day, he can see ghostly shadows of people from all the mensch races, walking around and talking to each other. Aleatha is there when he uses his amulet to activate the platform, teleporting him instantly to a different citadel&mdash; where, as it turns out, there are other survivors. Marit finds herself in a Sartan prison. On a bench in the middle of the room, Haplo recovers from injuries caused by the Cursed Blade. Across from it, Hugh the Hand and the dog watch her with unblinking eyes. Their \"jailer\": none other than Alfred, who rescued them from Chelestra. After some discussion, Haplo realizes that they are in the Vortex, the one-way gate at the very center of the Labyrinth. It was here that the Patryns were initially imprisoned and chose to live for generations, until people calling themselves Nexus runners started trying to escape. (It's unknown when they abandoned the Vortex and all moved out into the Labyrinth.) Haplo decides to enter the Labyrinth in search of his daughter, whom Marit named Rue. Hugh agrees to go with him, as does Marit at Xar's command; he has told Marit to hold off on killing Haplo to report back any conversations Alfred and Haplo have about the other worlds. It is only Alfred who balks. He has nothing left&mdash; Orla \"saw\" Samah's death and chose a peaceful death to be with him&mdash; but fear of the unknown. The Labyrinth itself, however, refuses to let him return to the Vortex by unceremoniously dropping a mountain on top of the exit back into it. To Haplo, the Labyrinth seems afraid of Alfred, though he can't for the life of him figure out why; what is Alfred, besides a bumbling, useless Sartan? ...who can turn into a dragon and bring people back from the dead? The group is about to be overrun by tiger-men when, surprisingly, a Patryn raiding party comes to save them. This party comes from Abri, the one and only city inside the Labyrinth (anathema to the lone-wolf Patryns). While camping overnight, Alfred admits his true name to Haplo: Coren, a Sartan word that can mean \"to choose\" or perhaps \"chosen.\" Many Sartan children were named that, in hopes of a self-fulfilling prophecy, but (as Haplo points out) Alfred did not feel particularly amused when he awoke, the last living Sartan on Arianus. Clearly Alfred was Coren, was chosen&mdash;but for what? Marit, however, betrays them by revealing that Alfred is a Sartan. Haplo, Hugh, and Alfred are jailed by the city's leader, Headman Vasu, to await Lord Xar&mdash; Marit accused Haplo of being a traitor and plotting against their people&mdash; but are freed again just as quickly after Marit overhears the disguised Sang-drax plotting to kill them. Sang-drax and his cronies are also gathering a huge army of the Labyrinth's native monsters, with which to destroy the city of Abri and seal the Final Gate; they allowed Marit to overhear them to feed off the emotions that would come from it. Abri's occupants prepare for its defense, while Haplo and Marit, prodded by the dog, finally find their love for each other. Alfred feels out of place; though few seem to begrudge him his Sartan heritage, he is still out-of-place here, a clumsy pacifist in a city preparing for war. Talking with Headman Vasu, however, he eventually discovers that the city was not made by Patryns (who do not build cities,) or at least not by Patryns alone&mdash; the Sartan \"heretics\" who were expelled into the Labyrinth were accepted by the Patryns, eventually integrating completely into the society; Vasu himself is half-and-half, supplementing his Patryn tattoos with Sartan magic. The Patryns taught them the value of family; the Sartan, in return, taught the Patryns the value of banding together. Here, at the heart of the Labyrinth, rises Abri, the city that symbolizes the best in both cultures. Alfred also finds out why he is called the Serpent Mage: it is a title from a Sartan hierarchy of strength in magic, whose levels are named after animals. Serpent is very near the top. Alfred has found the meaning of his name: to choose his power, and all the responsibility it comes with... or to choose Alfred, who would rather faint than have to use his magic. Back on Pryan, Drugar returns from the other citadel with knowledge: he knows how to stop the tytans. Aleatha has fled the maze, though; pushed into hysterics by his sudden (and literal) disappearance, she ran back to her brother, and the four are now at a \"party\" of Xar's, at which he hopes to kill them with poisoned wine so that their bodies will be undamaged. Zifnab, however, saves them by drinking all of it himself and saying that it was poisoned, faking his death once again. The mensch are horrified at the revelation that Xar means to kill them. Aleatha escapes the room, while the other three are sealed inside by Xar... until Zifnab's dragon discovers Zifnab's \"death\" and tears the room apart. Aleatha has fled once again into the maze, where Xar can't pursue her because of protective Sartan runes covering its path. She runs into Drugar and he tells her they have to let the tytans inside to help them; he shares with her how to stop them. They run for the gates, but before they can reach it, Xar attacks; Drugar sacrifices himself to save Aleatha. Xar is about to kill Aleatha when the dragon strikes, distracting Xar with battling it instead of killing mensch. The other mensch have escaped from the destroyed room and find her, and they think she's mad when she tells them what she's going to do. She uses the amulet to open the gate and invites the tytans inside; they peacefully enter and ask, &mdash;Where is the citadel? to which Aleatha answers, \"Here is the Citadel. You are home.\" Xar recovers from his battle with the dragon, and prepares to leave for the Labyrinth after Marit reports back to him&mdash; apparently corrupted by Haplo's influence into thinking Xar has made a mistake in allying with the dragon-snakes, as she says they are planning an attack. He is surprised when the tytans don't kill the mensch, and actually act to protect the mensch from him, but he avoids a fight by snatching Drugar's amulet from Aleatha and running away with it. The amulet will gain him entry into the Sartan ship, which he can then use to return to the Labyrinth. At Abri, the battle between Patryns and Labyrinth creatures rages fiercely, but the real threat comes from the dragon-snakes. Haplo, Marit, and Hugh lead a sortie to deal with them, and the three battle Sang-drax in his serpent form. Sang-drax is apparently killed by Haplo, but Haplo has been badly injured and almost crushed beneath the massive body. Marit is attacked by a wolfen when a green and golden dragon carries it away: Alfred, having made his choice to accept his power. He lifts the serpent's body off of Haplo, leaving Marit to hold his blood-soaked form, his heart-rune's wound having reopened. But while Alfred is distracted in battle with the dragon-snakes, Xar appears. He wants Haplo's knowledge of the Chamber of the Damned, and will stop at nothing to get it. The battle ends with the Labyrinth's armies driven off, but Marit dazed and wounded, Haplo abducted by Xar, and Alfred missing in action.",
    " The Eight features two intertwined storylines set centuries apart. The first takes place in 1972 and follows American computer expert Catherine “Cat” Velis as she is sent to Algeria for a special assignment. The second is set in 1790 and revolves around Mireille, a novice nun at Montglane Abbey. The fates of both characters are intertwined as they try to unravel the mystery behind the Montglane Service, a chess set that holds the key to a game of unlimited power. A gift from the Moors to Emperor Charlemagne, these pieces have been hunted fervently throughout the years by those seeking ultimate control. In the throes of the French Revolution, Mireille and her cousin Valentine must help in dispersing the pieces of the chess set to keep them out of the wrong hands. However, when Valentine is brutally murdered in Reign of Terror, Mireille is thrown into the midst of men and women who would pursue power at any cost, including Napoleon, Robespierre, Talleyrand, Catherine the Great, and more. She comes to realize she must rely on her own intuition and tenacity to accomplish her goal. In 1972, Cat Velis faces a similar atmosphere of conspiracy, assassination and betrayal. When she is requested by an antique dealer to recover the chess pieces, she unwittingly enters into a mysterious game that will endanger her life. As she learns the story of the Montglane Service, she begins to realize that players of the Game may plan their moves, but their very existence makes them pawns as well.",

    " In his \"Preliminary Discourse\", Barruel defines the three forms of conspiracy as the \"conspiracy of impiety\" against God and Christianity, the \"conspiracy of rebellion\" against kings and monarchs, and \"the conspiracy of anarchy\" against society in general. He sees the end of the 18th century as \"one continuous chain of cunning, art, and seduction\" intended to bring about the \"overthrow of the altar, the ruin of the throne, and the dissolution of all civil society\". The first volume examines the anti-Christian conspiracy that was begun by Voltaire in 1728 when Barruel claimed that Voltaire \"consecrated his life to the annihilation of Christianity\". Barruel returned to the principal texts of the Enlightenment and found reasons to draw close links between the philosophism of the time and the anti-Christian campaigns of the Revolution. Here he found that the philosophes had created an age of pretend philosophy which they used in their battle with Christianity. Their commitment to liberty and equality were really commitments of \"pride and revolt\". Barruel claimed that the proponents of the Enlightenment led people into illusion and error and refers to the philosophes as \"Writers of this species, so far from enlightening the people, only contribute to lead them into the path of error\". He alleged that Voltaire, dAlembert, and Frederick II, the King of Prussia, planned the course of events that lead to the French Revolution. They began with an attack on the Church where a \"subterranean warfare of illusion, error, and darkness waged by the Sect\" attempted to destroy Christianity. The influence of the philosophes could not be underrated according to Barruel. They created the intellectual framework that put the conspiracy in motion and controlled the ideology of the secret societies. Barruel appears to have read the work of the philosophes and his direct and extensive quotes shows a deep knowledge of their beliefs. This is unusual among the enemies of the Enlightenment, who rarely distracted themselves by reading the works and authors they were attacking. Barruel believed the philosophes were important as the original villains that seduced the population and made Enlightenment, and subsequently revolutionary, ideals favorable. The second volume focuses on the anti-monarchical conspiracy that was led by Jean Jacques Rousseau and Baron de Montesquieu. These conspirators sought to destroy the established monarchies under the guise of \"Independence and Liberty\". Barruel analyses and criticizes Montesquieus The Spirit of Laws and Rousseaus Social Contract because the application of the ideas expressed in these books had \"given birth to that disquieted spirit which fought to investigate the rights of sovereignty, the extent of their authority, the pretended rights of the free man, and without which every subject is branded for a slave - and every king a despot\". He believed that the influence of these two writers was a necessary factor in the enactment of the French Revolution. He agreed with the revolutionaries as they themselves placed the remains of Voltaire and Rousseau in the Pantheon to pay homage to the \"fathers of the revolution\". Barruel believed that the philosophes had created a lasting influence as their spirit survived through their writings and continued to promote anti-monarchical feelings within the Jacobins and the revolutionaries. The destruction of monarchies in Europe led to the triumph of the Jacobins as they trampled \"underfoot the altars and the thrones in the name of that equality and that liberty which summon the peoples to the disasters of revolution and the horrors of anarchy\". Barruel equated the rejection on monarchy with a rejection of any type of order and government. As a result, the principles of equality and liberty and their attacks against the monarchy were attacks against all governments and civil society. He presented a choice to his readers between monarchy and the \"reign of anarchy and absolute independence\". Barruels third volume addresses the antisocial conspiracy that was the objective of the Freemasons and the Order of the Illuminati. The philosophes and their attacks against the church and the throne paved the way for the conspiracy that was led by these secret societies. These groups were believed to have constituted a single sect that numbered over 300,000 members who were \"all zealous for the Revolution, and all ready to rise at the first signal and to impart the shock to all others classes of the people\". Barruel surveyed the history of Masonry and maintained that its higher mysteries had always been of an atheist and republican cast. He believed the Freemasons kept their words and aims secret for many years but on August 12, 1792, two days after the fall of the French monarchy, they ran though the streets openly announcing their secrets. The secret words were \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity\" and the secret aim was the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the republic. Barruel claimed he heard them speak these words in France but that in other countries the Masons still kept their secrets. A division of the group into numerous lodges ensured that if the secrets of one lodge were discovered, the rest would remain hidden. He believed that it was his job to warn all governments and people of the goals of the Freemasons. Barruel described in detail how this system worked in the case of the Illuminati. Even after Johann Adam Weishaupt, the leader of the sect, was discovered and tried in court, the proceedings could not uncover the universal influence of the Illuminati and no steps were taken against the group. The majority of the secret societies could always survive and carry on their activities because of the organization of the group. The Illuminati, as a whole, functioned to radicalize the movement against the throne and altar and influenced more members of the population to subscribe to their hidden principles. They refined the secret structure that had been provided by the Masons basic framework. For Barruel, the final designs of the coalition of the philosophes, the Freemasons and the Illuminati were achieved by the Jacobins. These clubs were formed by \"the adepts of impiety, the adepts of rebellion, and the adepts of anarchy\" working together to implement their radical agenda. Their guiding philosophy and actions were the culmination of the conspiracy as they directly wanted to end the monarchy and the church. Barruel believed that the only difference between the Jacobins and their precursors was that the Jacobins actually brought down the church and the throne and were able to institute their basic beliefs and goals while their precursors only desired to do these things without much success. According to Barruel, the first major assault on the Enlightenment came during the French Revolution. In the minds of many, the Enlightenment was inextricably connected to the Revolution that followed. This presumed link resulted in an explosion of literature that was hostile to the Enlightenment. When the leaders of the Revolution canonized Voltaire and Rousseau and made the Enlightenment themes of reason, progress, anti-clericalism and emancipation central to their own revolutionary vocabulary, it created a link that meant any backlash against the Revolution would increase opposition to the Enlightenment. The advent of what Graeme Garrard has called the \"continuity thesis\" between the Enlightenment and the Revolution – the belief that they were connected in some intrinsic way, as cause and effect- proved damaging to the Enlightenment. For Barruel, the Revolution was not a spontaneous popular uprising expressing a long-suppressed general will. It was instead the consequence of a united minority group who used force, subterfuge and terror to impose their will on an innocent and unsuspecting population. Barruel believed that the Revolution was caused by Voltaire, Rousseau and the other philosophes who conspired with secret societies to destroy Catholicism and the monarchy in France. He argued that the writings of the philosophes had a great influence on those who would lead the Revolution and that Voltaire and his followers were responsible for the training of revolutionaries. It was from the followers of the philosophes \"that the revolutionary ministers Necker and Turgot started up; from this class arose those grand revolutionary agents, the Mirabeaux, Sieyes, Laclos, Condorcets; these revolutionary trumps, the Brissots, Champforts, Garats, Cheniers; those revolutionary butchers, the Carras, Frerons, Marats\". Within the Memoirs, Barruel alleged that Diderots Encyclopédie was a Masonic project. He believed that the written works of the philosophes penetrated all aspects of society and that this massive collection was of particular significance. The Encyclopédie was only the first step in philosophizing mankind and was necessary to spread the impious and anti-monarchical writings. This created a mass movement against the church and society. Barruel believed that the conspirators attempt to \"imbue the minds of the people with the spirit of insurrection and revolt\" and to promote radicalism within all members of society. This was believed to be the main reason behind the Encyclopédie as it was \"a vast emporium of all the sophisms, errors, or calumnies which had ever been invented against religion\". It contained \"the most profligate and impious productions of Voltaire, Diderot, Boulanger, La Mettrie, and of other Deists or Atheists of the age, and this under the specious pretence of enlightening ignorance\". Barruel believed the volumes of the Encyclopédie were valuable in controlling the minds of intellectuals and in creating a public opinion against Christianity and monarchy. Philosophism was a term used by Barruel within the Memoirs to refer to the pretend philosophy that the philosophes practiced. It was originally coined by Catholic opponents of the philosophes but was popularized by Barruel. It referred to the principles that were shared by philosophes, Freemasons, and Illuminati. Barruel defined philosophism as \"the error of every man who, judging of all things by the standard of his own reason, rejects in religious matters every authority that is not derived from the light of nature. It is the error of every man who denies the possibility of any mystery beyond the limits of reason if everyone who, discarding revelation in defence of the pretended rights of reason, Equality, and Liberty, seeks to subvert the whole fabric of the Christian religion\". The term had a lasting influence as by the end of the 18th century it had become a popular term of abuse used by conservative journals to refer to supporters of the Revolution. These journals accused those who practiced philosophism as having no principles or respect for authority. They were skeptics who failed to believe in the monarchy and the church and thus, had no principles. The use of the term became pervasive in the Anti-Jacobin Review and contributed to the belief in a connection between the Enlightenment and the Revolution and its supporters. Philosophism became a powerful tool of anti-revolutionary and anti-Jacobin rhetoric. Barruel identified a number of individuals who he believed played direct roles in the Enlightenment and the conspiracy against Christianity and the state. He identified Voltaire as the \"chief\", d’Alembert as the \"most subtle agent\", Frederick II as the \"protector and adviser\", and Diderot as its \"forlorn hope\". Voltaire was at the head of the conspiracy because he spent his time with the highest levels of European society. His attention and efforts were directed at kings and high ranking ministers. DAlembert worked behind the scenes and inside the more common areas of French society. He employed his skill in the cafes and academies and attempted to bring more followers to the conspiracy. Barruel takes a close look at the correspondence between Voltaire and dAlembert and uses this as evidence of their plot to overthrow society. He is deeply concerned with the fact that those he identifies as the leaders of the plot had secret names for one another in their private correspondence. Voltaire was \"Raton\", dAlembert was \"Protagoras\", Frederick was \"Luc\", and Diderot was known as \"Plato\". Barruel also argued that the conspiracy extended far beyond this small group of philosophes. He believed that the court of Louis XV was a \"Voltairean ministry\" of powerful men. This group involved Marquis dArgenson who \"formed the plan for the destruction of all religious orders in France\", the Duc de Choiseul who was \"the most impious and most despotic of ministers\", the \"friend and confidant of dAlembert\", Archbishop de Briennes, and Malesherbes, \"protector of the conspiracy\". According to Barruel, this group of influential leaders worked together with a number of adepts who supported the conspiracy. The most important adept that Barruel identifies is Condorcet. Barruel claimed that Condorcet was a Freemason and leading member of the Society of 1789 who was elected to the Legislative Assembly and was \"the most resolute atheist\". Condorcet was important because he embodied everything that Barruel claimed the conspiracy was. He was a Freemason that associated with the philospohes and who would become an influential member of the revolution process. Barruel also lists the Baron dHolbach, Buffon, La Mettrie, Raynal, Abbé Yvon, Abbé de Prades, Abbé Morrelet, La Harpe, Marmontel, Bergier and Duclos among the members of the \"synagogue of impiety\".",

    " In South Africa under apartheid, Mehring is a rich white businessman who is not satisfied with his life. His ex-wife has gone to America, his liberal son (who is probably gay) criticizes his conservative/capitalist ways and his lovers and colleagues do not seem actually interested in him. Out of a whim he buys a farm outside the city, afterwards trying to explain this purchase to himself as the search for a higher meaning in life. But it is clear that he knows next to nothing to farming, and that black workers run it - Mehring is simply an outsider, an intruder on the daily life of \"his\" farm. One day the black foreman, Jacobus, finds an unidentified dead body on the farm. Since the dead man is black, the police find no urgency to look into the case and simply bury the body on the spot where it was found. The idea of an unknown black man buried on his land begins to \"haunt\" Mehring. This has been interpreted as the influence of apartheid on the class of privileged white people who profit from it while ignoring its victims. A flood brings the body back to the surface; although the farm workers do not know the stranger, they now give him a proper burial as if he were a family member. There are hints that Mehring's own burial will be less emotional than this burial of a stranger. This can be interpreted to symbolize the white man's position in South Africa: although he \"owns\" the land on a piece of paper, the black natives have the actual claim on the land. it:Il conservatore",

When the company arrive in Brighton for a one-week run at the Theatre Royal, Flood is confident that he will be able to use his stay to get in touch with his estranged wife Jenny, who has filed for divorce and is now living with Roger Colborn, a local businessman, on the outskirts of the city. Flood is surprised to find that it is Jenny who contacts him first: She tells him she is being stalked and, as she believes that her husband is to blame for it, asks him to do something about it. This is how Flood meets Derek Oswin, the alleged stalker, an eccentric man his own age who, just like his deceased father and grandfather before him, worked for the Colborns' family business until its liquidation in 1989. It turns out Oswin has written a history of the company but so far has not found a publisher. Talking to Oswin and to other people he meets, either by chance or by design, Flood more and more gets the impression that Roger Colborn is a dangerous man who has something to hide, and that Jenny must be saved from the clutches of the Colborn family before it is too late. Thus, Flood's interest in the affairs of a now defunct company is fuelled by his desire to win back Jenny, so much so that his professional life is affected. Trying to dig up dirt on the Colborns, he is drawn into a quagmire of events he cannot make head or tail of and eventually misses an evening's performance without giving any notice. When, however, on the following day he finds his understudy&mdash;the man who saved his neck the previous night&mdash;dead in the streets of Brighton he realizes the seriousness of the situation. In the course of one week homes are broken into, evidence is stolen, several people die, family secrets are uncovered, and an inheritance is reclaimed. Justice triumphs in the end.",
    " Shortly before noon on Saturday October 21 of an unspecified year after 2012 (evident by mention of a faded bumper sticker for Barack Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign), the small Maine town of Chester's Mill is abruptly and gruesomely separated from the outside world by an invisible, semipermeable barrier of unknown origin. The immediate appearance of the barrier causes a number of injuries and fatalities, and traps former Army Captain Dale \"Barbie\" Barbara—who is trying to leave Chester's Mill—inside the town. Police Chief Howard \"Duke\" Perkins is soon killed when his pacemaker explodes after getting too close to the barrier. This removes the last significant opposition to James \"Big Jim\" Rennie, used car salesman and the town's Second Selectman. Big Jim exerts significant influence within Chester's Mill, and seizes the opportunity to use the barrier as part of a power play to take over the town. Big Jim appoints one of his cronies, the incompetent Peter Randolph, as the new Police Chief. He also begins expanding the ranks of the Chester's Mill Police with questionable candidates, including his son, Junior Rennie, and his friends. Junior has frequent migraines caused by an as-yet undiscovered brain tumor which has also begun affecting his mental state; unbeknownst to Big Jim, Junior was in the process of beating and strangling a girl to death when the barrier appeared, and has killed another girl by the time Rennie places him on the police force. Elsewhere in Chester's Mill, Julia Shumway, the editor of the local newspaper, is phoned by Colonel James O. Cox, who has her carry a message to Barbie to contact him. When he does, Cox requests that Barbie act as the government's liaison in an effort to bring down the Dome, as it has come to be known. Because of Barbie's talents as a former bomb factory hunter, Cox gives him the task of locating the source, which is believed to be inside the Dome. Cox is also able to foresee the small town political ramifications of such a situation. By virtue of a Presidential order, Barbie is reinstated in the US Military and promoted to full Colonel. Barbie is also presented with a decree granting him authority over the township. However, smalltown politics being what they are, this action is not well received by Big Jim and his misguided band of renegade police officers. As Big Jim covertly encourages and orchestrates unease and panic among the town to build up his grab for power, Barbie, Julia and a number of other townspeople attempt to stop things from spiraling out of control. After crossing Rennie's path on several occasions, Barbie is framed and arrested for 4 murders. He is accused of killing Reverend Lester Coggins, who laundered money for Rennie's large-scale methamphetamine operation, and Duke's widow Brenda Perkins, who were both murdered by Big Jim. While Barbie is in jail other residents track the source of the Dome to an abandoned farm, and the device is strongly indicated to be extraterrestrial in origin. The restrictions issued by Rennie become more severe and the police force grows more abusive, galvanizing the town and eventually leading some residents to break Barbie out of jail, killing Junior seconds before he can murder Barbie. The semi-organized resistance flees to the abandoned farm, where multiple people touch the strange object and experience visions. They not only conclude that the device was put in place by extraterrestrial \"leatherheads\" (so named for their appearance), but that specifically they are juveniles who have set up the Dome as a cruel form of entertainment, a sort of ant farm used to capture sentient beings and allow their captors to view everything that happens inside. On an organized \"Visitors Day\"—when people outside the Dome can meet at its edge with people within—Big Jim sends Randolph and a detachment of police to take back control of his former meth operation from Phil \"Chef\" Bushey, who is stopping Rennie from covering up the operation as well as hoarding the more than four-hundred tanks of propane stored there. Many are killed in the ensuing gunfight and Chef, who is mortally wounded, detonates a plastic explosive device he has placed in the meth production facility. The ensuing explosion, combined with the propane and meth-making chemicals, unleashes a toxic firestorm. More than a thousand of the town's residents are quickly incinerated on national television, leaving alive only the twenty-six survivors at the abandoned barn, an orphaned farm boy hiding in a potato cellar, and Big Jim and his informal aide-de-camp, Carter Thibodeau, in the town's fallout shelter. Big Jim and Thibodeau eventually turn on each other; Big Jim stabs and disembowels Thibodeau, only to die several hours later when hallucinations of the dead send him fleeing into the now-toxic environment outside. The survivors at the barn begin to slowly asphyxiate, despite efforts by the Army to force clean air through the walls of the Dome. Barbie and Julia go to the control device to beg their captors to release them. Julia is able to make contact with a single female leatherhead, no longer accompanied by her friends and thus not caught up in their peer pressure. After repeatedly expressing that they are real sentient beings with real \"little lives\", and by sharing a painful childhood incident with the adolescent alien, Julia convinces the leatherhead to have pity on them. The Dome raises up slowly and vanishes, allowing the toxic air to dissipate and finally freeing the town of Chester's Mill.",

It can be read simultaneously as an unusual, charming love story, a description of the political and social forces at work in 1920s Brazil, a somewhat satirical depiction of Latin American aspirations to \"modernity\", and a celebration of the local culture and pleasures of Bahia. The book was made into series for Brazilian television in 1960, in 1976 and again in 2012. A feature film of the novel was directed by Bruno Barreto in 1983. The feature version starred Sonia Braga as Gabriela and Marcello Mastroianni as Nacib, and featured original music by Antonio Carlos Jobim.",
    " As a restless high school athlete in a small, unnamed town in North Carolina, Jason Maddox, the book's narrator, has a sexual encounter with his popular girlfriend’s alcoholic mother. Rumors of the encounter circulate at school, and Jason’s girlfriend, distraught when she learns of them, attempts suicide. Jason, himself previously popular, is shunned by his classmates, including the one who started the rumors. Jason confronts and savagely beats that classmate, and in the aftermath, he's arrested, expelled from school, and all but disowned by his conservative, mortified parents. Taking a job as a house painter, Jason moves into an apartment complex where he befriends his new neighbor, Bernard “Peewee” Mash, an intellectually precocious fifteen-year-old who, like Jason, is a local pariah. Peewee introduces Jason to art, literature, and, most importantly, punk rock. He and Jason are particularly enamored of the Los Angeles punk band Rule of Thumb, which is led by a Berkeley-educated poet, Jim Cassady, whom Jason and Peewee both revere. Learning that Rule of Thumb will be performing at New York City’s CBGB, Jason quits his job in order to drive himself and Peewee to New York. After the show, they speak to Jim Cassady, who advises them to start a band. They immediately make plans to move to Manhattan, where they live on the Lower East Side, center of the New York punk scene. There, Peewee becomes increasingly difficult, at odds with Jason musically and envious of Jason’s sexual prowess. Alternately given to tantrums and sullen silences, Peewee is ousted from the band that he co-founded. He and Jason pursue music separately until, recognizing how much they miss each other, they reconcile and start a new band. The new band has a growing reputation for its explosive, destructive shows, which result in injuries to person and property alike. Banned from most local venues, the band begins touring the U.S., and in the midst of what will prove to be its final tour, Peewee is killed in a car crash, with Jason narrowly surviving. Devastated by the loss of Peewee, Jason decides he’s finished with music, and, using money from an insurance settlement, he produces and directs a film that takes him to Los Angeles, where he falls in love with an aspiring actress who is herself seeking a new life after fleeing the civil wars in her native Yugoslavia. The actress, Irina, is married to a wealthy Englishman who is happily unaware of her affair with Jason and, possibly, others prior, though Irina denies any previous affairs to Jason. Their stormy romance is addictive to Jason, who begs Irina to leave her husband for him. She repeatedly, and emptily, assures him she will. At a party one night, Jason meets another former punk who tells him that Jim Cassady has recently been spotted, homeless and panhandling on the streets of Hollywood. This is the first sighting of Cassady, as far as Jason knows, since Rule of Thumb disbanded in the early 80s. Jason has always been mystified and intrigued by Cassady’s disappearance, and, on the Internet, he reads of other alleged Cassady sightings. Determined to find Cassady, Jason discovers that he’s now living in a bleak Los Angeles suburb with his elderly, controlling mother. He shares some of his recent songs and poems with Jason, who thinks they're deserving of a wide audience. Except for Cassady's music and the advice he gave Jason and Peewee at CBGB almost twenty years before, Jason might still be miserable in North Carolina, and he means to express his gratitude by helping Cassady gain a new following. But Cassady is resigned to obscurity, and he grudgingly submits to Jason’s efforts on his behalf. Perhaps out of spite, he causes a rupture in Jason’s relationship with Irina, and Jason promises to kill him for it, only to reaffirm, in the book's epilogue, how indebted he is to Cassady, who has again changed the course of his life.",
    " As volunteers clean up after a huge outdoor rock concert in Yorkshire in 1969, they discover the body of a young woman wrapped in a sleeping bag. She has been brutally murdered. The detective assigned to the case, Stanley Chadwick, is a hard-headed, strait-laced veteran of the Second World War. He could not have less in common with - or less regard for - young, disrespectful, long-haired hippies, smoking marijuana and listening to the pulsing sounds of rock and roll. But he has a murder to solve, and it looks as if the victim was somehow associated with the up-and-coming psychedelic pastoral band the Mad Hatters. In the present, Inspector Alan Banks is investigating the murder of a freelance music journalist who was working on a feature about the Mad Hatters for MOJO magazine. This is not the first time that the Mad Hatters, now aging rock superstars, have been brushed by tragedy. Banks finds he has to delve into the past to find out exactly what hornets' nest the journalist inadvertently stirred up.",
    " Leonora Eyre, an attractive and elegant, but essentially selfish, middle-aged woman, becomes friendly with antique dealer Humphrey Boyce and his nephew James. Both men are attracted to Leonora, but Leonora prefers the young, good-looking James to the more \"suitable\" Humphrey. While James is away on a buying trip, Leonora discovers to her annoyance that he has been seeing Phoebe, a girl of his own age. Leonora makes use of Humphrey to humiliate Phoebe, and turns out a sitting tenant in order that James can take up a flat in her own house. She does this in an apparent attempt to control his life. While abroad, the bisexual James has begun a relationship with an American, the amoral Ned, who later follows him to London. Ned prises James out of Leonora's grasp, only to reject him for another lover. James attempts a reconciliation with Leonora, but she refuses to give him a second opportunity to hurt her, and settles for the admiration of the less attractive Humphrey. As with all Pym's fiction, the novel contains many literary references, notably to works by Keats, John Milton and Henry James.",
    " The story takes place in Montefiore, Italy in the early 16th century, on the estate of a nobleman named Don Vicente de Nevada. He lives there with his seven year old daughter, Bianca, and a small staff, the two most interesting of which are Primavera, an earthy cook and Fra Ludovico. In the beginning of the novel, de Nevada finds a mirror in a pond near his manor. This mirror was fashioned by dwarves but lost when they left it in the pond to temper. Incidentally, one dwarf spends most of the novel following de Nevada to ask the return of the mirror. Life is good for the family until the day Lucrezia Borgia and her brother, Cesare, decadent children of a pope, come to visit. Cesare sends Vincente on a quest for a holy relic. While he is gone, Bianca becomes a young woman and Lucrezia becomes jealous of the girl's beauty and stealing Cesare's attention from Lucrezia. Eventually she hires a woodsman to kill Bianca. The girl escapes, and runs into seven dwarfs, who are looking for the eighth dwarf and their mirror.",
    " The book describes the construction of an important bridge in Albanian territory at an ungiven time or age. Told by a catholic monk, Gjon (Gjon is a name used by Northern Albanians who were mostly catholic prior to Turkish invasions), the story of the bridge, as seen by Gjon is filled with prissy, unhappy bureaucrats, who take the events at face value without ever trying to understand the larger forces at work. Both the river Ujana e Keqe and the bridge itself are major characters in the book, and they undergo significant transformations. One of the startling events of the book is when a \"volunteer\" is immured inside the bridge in order to make a \"sacrifice\" to the river. The man's face is captured in the plaster that surrounds him, as unforgettable as it is horrifying. Though clearly a punishment for the crime of sabotage against the bridge, as Gjon recounts this event, it is less an act of vengeance than it is a true sacrifice. But more than that, it becomes a symbol for the ignorance of and squabbling among tiny Albanian principalities and their fight amongst one another, in front of a major threat.",
    " The novel describes a world set in the year 2048 after a catastrophe which has fractured the United States into several nations. The protagonists live in San Francisco and have evolved in the direction of Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy, using wind power, local agriculture, and the like. San Francisco is presented as a mostly pagan city where the streets have been torn up for gardens and streams, no one starves or is homeless, and the city's defense council consists primarily of nine elderly women who \"listen and dream\". The novel describes \"a utopia where women are leading societies but are doing so with the consent of men.\" To the south, though, an overtly-theocratic Christian fundamentalist nation has evolved and plans to wage war against the San Franciscans. The novel explores the events before and during the ensuing struggle between the two nations, pitting utopia and dystopia against each other. The basic premise resembles that of Pat Murphy's earlier novel The City, Not Long After. The story is primarily told from the points of view of 98-year-old Maya, her nominal granddaughter Madrone, and her grandson Bird. Through these and other characters, the story explores many elements from ecofeminism and ecotopian fiction.",
    " Renn, a gifted but often bullied Eight Year novice in the Echorium who can speak to Half-Creatures, is asked to assist the Singers by translating for Shaiala Two-Hoof, a wild girl brought to the Island for treatment, who claims to have been raised by centaurs. Although initially the pair argue, meeting Rialle helps to calm Shaiala and she begins to remember, enough to reveal that her memories were wiped using a mask made of khiz. Second Singer Kherron takes this excuse to insist that Shaiala and Renn leave with him to search for Frazhin, the escaped khizpriest whose body was never found. After this revelation, Rialle takes Shaiala, who was very disturbed by her recolllections, and Renn to come to the cave where she lives and meet the merlee. While Shaiala swims with the merlee, Renn rejects their friendly offers and is horrified to learn that \"crazy\" Rialle is his mother. The next day, Renn and Shaiala leave with Kherron on the Wavesong, heading to Southport. On the journey, Renn is irritable and offends Shaiala by refusing to believe her tales of centaurs. Kherron also gives Shaiala a bluestone necklace. Upon arrival, the group begin to explore Southport and Shaiala, despite being closelyguarded by a pentad of orderlies including Frenn and Lazim, escapes, only to become lost in the rough part of the city. She is kidnapped and thrown in a cellar with several street children, and Erihan, the son of Lord Nahar, the leader of the Kalerei tribe of Horselords. The children are taken away by barge towards the Plains. While Kherron attempts to trace Shaiala through her bluestone necklace, they rapidly loose track of the barge. Meanwhile, the children meet \"Aunt Yashra\", a seemingly kindly pregnant woman who asks to hear each child sing, and then chooses some to return to her \"Singing Palace\" while others are to be \"gotten rid of\". This disturbs Shaiala, who recognises Yashra, and causes friction between the children, with many of those chosen wanting to stay. However, after three days of cramped conditions, they hatch a plan to escape. Shaiala kicks a hole in the side of the boat for the children to escape through, but several are left behind as the boat begins to sink, attracting the crew's attention. Shaiala and the other remaining children are taken to Aunt Yashra's camp, where Yashra uses the khiz mask to make them passive. Shaiala remembers the mask and, with Erihan's help, escapes. Shaiala and Erihan steal Yashra's horses and head onto the Plains together to search for tracks - Erihan for Horselord's, Shaiala for centaur's. Meanwhile, Renn is asked to track Shaiala's bluestone, as novices are more sensitive than Singers. Although they follow the barge for a few days, Renn is shocked when the bluestone is suddenly underwater, and he fears Shaiala has drowned. However, the bluestone is soon retrieved by a Half-Creature similar to a merlee, known as a naga. The Singers follow the naga upriver, and eventually arrange a meeting. The naga shows them its collection of 'sparklies' - consisting of Shaiala's bluestone, a piece of khiz and Erihan's dagger. Seeing Erihan's dagger, the Singers are attacked by Lord Nahar and the Kaleri, who have been following the Singers in their search for Erihan. After a brief confrontation, the two groups agree to work together, and the Horselords tell the Singers about the Sunless Valley, reachable only though the Pass of Silence, where they suspect the children have been taken. Renn contacts the naga again and, in exchange for the return of a 'sparkly', it tells them where it found the dagger - with Shaiala's bluestone - and where it found the khiz, in the mountains. However, it leaves before Renn can ask if it knows another way into the Sunless Valley. Meanwhile, Shaiala and Erihan eventually track down Shaiala's herd of centaurs by the Dancing Canyons. Seeing them, Shaiala remembers why no-one else had spotted them - the adults use herdstones to bend light around the herd, rendering it invisible. Shaiala offers to take herdstones to the centaur foals enslaved in the Sunless Valley, and she and Erihan travel there through underwater caves, guided by naga, within which they see khiz crystal poisoning the naga eggs. Meanwhile, the Singers attempt to get through the Pass of Silence, a pass so precarious that the slightest noise can start an avalanche. However, when they are attacked, Renn accidentally cries out, setting off an avalanche. Frenn and another orderly are killed, Kherron is captured, a crystal forced into his throat, and is taken away, and only Renn's quick thinking saves himself and the other orderlies from the second avalanche set off by the Harai guarding the Pass. Grateful, Lazim finally explains how Frazhin disappeared after the Battle of the Merlee twenty years ago, and, although those sent to find his body disappeared, he was not considered a threat after the khiz was destroyed. While the orderlies attempt to disable to gong used to set off avalanches in the Pass of Silence - thereby allowing Lord Nahar and the Kaleri to pass through safely - Renn hides, only to be caught by Yashra as she brings in the captured street children, and be taken to the Khizalace - Yashra's stronghold. However, there is trouble in the Valley - Shaiala and Erihan have arrived to find the captured centaurs working as slaves to mine khiz, and have freed them with herdstones, leading a revolution. The angry foals storm the palace, leaving Shaiala and Erihan no choice but to follow. They get inside the Khizalace, but are soon separated from the centaurs. Instead, they find a group of street children, apparently hypnotised, and follow them to their dormitory, which is dominated by the presence of a giant khiz crystal. Although the pair quickly disable the guards, they are unable to break the crystal's hold on the children, and only just keep from sucumbing themselves. Renn is taken to see Singer Kherron in the dungeons, who is clearly badly injured by the khiz crystal in his throat. Frazhin arrives, and attempts to force Kherron to teach the children in the Khizalace the Songs of Power, scorning the Singer's attempts to break free. Frazhin threatens that if Kherron does not help him, he will harm Renn - whom Frazhin believes to be Kherron's son. It is made clear in the conversation that Yashra's unborn child is Frazhin's. Renn is taken away, but escapes from his guards when he hears of a \"wild centaur girl\" causing havoc in the dormitories. He hurries to find Shaiala attempting to crack the khiz with her kicks, and helps her to crack the crystal and free the children. With the Khizalace shattering around them from the blow, the Harai flee, and Shaiala and Renn hurry to free Kherron, whose voice is badly damaged from the crystal, then join the battle outside. With the arrival of the Kaleri, the battle has turned in the Singer's favour, at least until Yashra appears and seals the gates against them with khiz power, trapping them inside. Although she seems victorious, capturing Erihan as a hostage and controlling the khiz against the Kaleri, she is distracted when Singer Kherron warns her to keep an eye on Frazhin, who is trying to escape without her. She hurries after him, and between Renn's singing and the centaur's kicks, the gates are destroyed. When the group catches up to Yashra, she is watching from the lakeshore as Frazhin on a boat in the centaur calls to the naga. Although they help him initially, they suddenly turn on him and pull him under the water. Yashra, trapped by the Singers, is offered a choice: immediate execution or life on the Echorium until her child is born followed by a course of Yehn. She chooses the Echorium, for the sake of her child, and protests before she is taken away that Frazhin's crimes are the Singer's fault, for destroying his hopes of joining them when he was a child. After leaving the valley, Shaiala and Renn forget their earlier disagreements, and with Renn's singing to assist her, Shaiala successfully cracks rock to find her own herdstone. A songless Kherron, after reporting to the Echorium with Renn's help, admits that, while he would be glad to call himself Renn's father, Rialle had a close relationship with Frenn - who Renn was named for - and Renn's parentage is uncertain. Shaiala joins the Kaleri to learn to be a tribeswoman from Erihan's mother, and Renn returns to the Echorium, where he reconciles with Rialle and the merlee.",
    " The Hunter, an alien lifeform (when not inside another being, resembling a four-pound green jellyfish) with the ability to live in symbiosis with and within another creature, is in hot pursuit of another of his kind. Both crash their ships into Earth, in the Pacific Ocean, and both survive the crashes. The Hunter makes its way to shore (its erstwhile host having been killed in the crash) and takes up residence in the nearest human being it can find (as it turns out, fifteen-year-old Robert Kinnaird) without letting the human being know. By the time it has figured out enough of what goes on inside a human being to look through Bob's eyes, it is shocked to find itself within an air vessel, being carried further away from its quarry every second. As it happens, Bob is simply returning to a New England boarding school from his home on an industrial island in the Western Pacific. Once Bob arrives at school, the Hunter sees no alternative to communicating with his host. After initial attempts produce panic in the boy, the Hunter eventually finds a way to convince Bob of his presence. Bob is very accepting of his guest, perhaps beyond what would be expected of a teenage boy who learns another entity is inside him, observing his every move. The two plot a way to return home. The puzzle distracts Bob from his studies, leading to a decline in grades that the school authorities ascribe to homesickness, and he is sent home for the remainder of the term. Upon arrival, the two begin to seek out their quarry. Bob is injured by an accident. The Hunter is able to hold the wound together, but he can't stop Bob from limping, and Bob is sent to the island doctor. They see no alternative to confiding in the doctor (the Hunter is forced to show his own form to convince the man) and the doctor becomes an ally in their search. Which of the many humans on the island is the host to their quarry? It is worse than a needle in a haystack (thus the title) because a needle at least looks like a needle, not a piece of straw. The Hunter is able to solve the riddle by observing the behavior of the island people. Bob's father, known for his attention to detail and safety, has been taking amazing risks. He is at least unconsciously aware that an accident will have no ill consequences. The quarry resides within him. The Hunter confirms this, and Bob and the alien have a new puzzle—how to get the alien out of Mr. Kinnaird's body without harming the man? This time, Bob comes up with the solution. He places himself in the middle of a large number of (empty) oil cans, uses a little actual oil to start a small fire, making it look like there will be a huge explosion shortly, and calls his father for help. The fugitive alien, fearful of being killed in the explosion, knocks out his host and removes himself from Mr. Kinnaird's unconscious body. As soon as the alien is a few feet away from Bob's father, the boy grabs the one full oil can, races over to the alien, pours oil over it, and lights it on fire. He then tends to his father. Mr. Kinnaird is fine, but Bob is worried. He and the Hunter had better come up with a good story for the man, or the Hunter will have to find some way to assuage the pain of a spanking.",

    " The story involves a widow named Minna Shaw. One evening, a witch falls from her broom when it loses the ability to fly and lands in the garden near Minna Shaw's house. Minna Shaw takes her in until she recovers, and when she does, the witch calls a friend to \"drive\" her home, leaving her own broom behind. Minna Shaw discovers the broom is still in her house and leaves it alone but is startled, and more than a little afraid, when it comes to life later that evening. She discovers that the broom is harmless, as all it does is sweep, but she teaches it how to feed the chickens, chop wood, and play the piano. While most of the neighbor women and children are comfortable with the broom, the men are concerned that it had been a witch's broom. Shortly afterwards, two boys begin to harass it. The broom, apparently angered, beats them and flings their dog over the forest. The boys' parents demand that the broom be burned at the stake. Minna Shaw surprisingly agrees, and the broom is burned. Things appear normal until the broom's phantom-white ghost begins stalking the Spiveys' house. The Spiveys are so terrified that they pack up and leave the house. Minna Shaw can now be alone and listen to the broom play the piano; she'd given the Spiveys her own ordinary household broom to burn and cooked up the plan for the magical broom (which was just painted white), to scare her neighbors away. She painted it white to make it look like the \"ghost\" broom.",
    " During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands Anne Frank began to keep a diary on June 14, 1942, two days after her 13th birthday, and twenty two days before going into hiding with her mother Edith Frank, father Otto Frank, sister Margot Frank and three other people, Hermann van Pels, Auguste van Pels, and Peter van Pels. The group went into hiding in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex of her father's office building in Amsterdam. The sealed-off upper-rooms also contained a hidden door behind which the Franks would hide during the parts when Nazi soldiers were investigating the buildings for harbored Jews. Mrs. van Pels' dentist, Fritz Pfeffer, joined them four months later. In the published version, names were changed: the van Pels are known as the Van Daans and Fritz Pfeffer is known as Mr. Dussel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and one month, until their betrayal in August 1944, which resulted in their deportation to Nazi concentration camps. Of the group of eight, only Otto Frank survived the war. Anne died in Bergen-Belsen from a typhus infection in early March, shortly (about two weeks) before liberation by British troops in April 1945.",
    " Jake spends a day having strange flashbacks of himself in a rainforest, which leaves him disturbed. That evening, after watching a boxing match with his brother and father, he leaves for a grocery store, where Tobias has discovered something has crashed and the high-ranking yeerks are trying to hide something. The other Animorphs join them, and together they infiltrate the store in fly morph. Cassie overhears Chapman saying that it was a Yeerk bug fighter. After Ax manages to reconfigure the ship's controls, the Animorphs escape, pursued by Chapman and the other Yeerks. They plan to fly the spacecraft to Washington, in order to convince the American government that Earth is under attack by extraterrestrials. When Ax discovers that the fighter's technology to keep human radar from seeing it is broken, they are intercepted by two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets, however, Cassie notices that they are over the Red Sea in the Middle East - far from their intended destination. Flying above the atmosphere, they are picked up by Visser Three's Blade ship sensors. The Animorphs, knowing they can't escape, try to fire on the Visser's vessel. Both Jake and the Blade ship fire their Dracon beams at the same time, and, coincidentally, their projectiles intersect, and both ships crash. The kids wake up in their wrecked Bug fighter. They look around, noticing that they've crash-landed in a rainforest. They assume they're in the Amazon rainforest, but are also disturbed by the fact that it is the middle of the day (whereas it was nighttime in the United States, which is in roughly the same time zone as South America). After Jake reveals the strange flashbacks he was having, Ax speculates they may have caused a \"Sario Rip\" and traveled twelve hours backwards through time, which would explain why Jake was having strange flashbacks: he was in two places at once, and the two Jakes---the \"past\" and \"future\" versions---experience each other's thoughts at random moments. However, Cassie later notices that only Jake has the flashes so Ax says that Jake is the only \"real\" person-the rest are just a memory. They soon find that the Yeerks have traveled backwards through time as well, and will need both ships to create another Sario Rip and return to the right time. Ax takes the Bug fighter's computer to prevent them from doing so, and the group ventures out into the hostile wilderness, constantly plagued by insects, fire ants, snakes and piranhas. They're pursued by the Yeerks, who ruthlessly destroy the animals and trees around them in a bid to kill the Animorphs, desperate to retrieve the precious computer. The children acquire jaguar and monkey morphs in order to traverse the rainforest more easily. They eventually stumble across a group of Amazon Indians, led by Polo, their tribal chief. Marco, who knows some Spanish, manages to roughly translate the natives' Portuguese, and Jake and Polo agree to assist one another in eliminating the Yeerks. Polo and his men kill the Hork-Bajir guarding the Blade ship with poison-tipped spears, leaving the Animorphs with Visser Three, who morphs an amphibian-like Lerdethak and picks the Animorphs off one by one. Jake morphs into a monkey to use the Ledethak's vine like arms to move himself to Visser Three's body. He then throws a poison-tipped spear into Visser Three: while never revealed, this may have been fatal. Regardless, Visser Three is still able to use an arm to break Jake's neck. However, Jake wakes up back at the grocery store, just as they are about to infiltrate it. He calls off the operation, and the Animorphs all go home. The next day Jake asks Ax what had happened. Ax postulates that the travel through time created two separate versions of Jake. The reason Jake simply \"woke up\" back at the grocery store was that the Jake in the rainforest died at the hands of Visser Three; since it is impossible for one consciousness to exist in two separate locations, when one was eliminated the two snapped back together. Ax also speculates that Jake had to die, or else both Jakes and both their universes would collide and cease to exist. The events in the rainforest never actually happened (including the acquisition of jaguar and monkey morphs), and only remain in Jake's memory. He is left with a feeling of chilling relief. *Sario Rips are introduced and explained.",

Figuring that it will reincarnate him if he changes it to plus and jumps in, he does so. It is left to the reader to decide whether Connor and Scrote were reincarnated or were fully annihilated.",
    " Count von Count and other Muppets are returning from a country drive in the Countmobile. But, in classic suspense/horror movie fashion, the bridge is out, so the group has to spend the night at a spooky old house. A giant monster butler escorts each character to a room, decorated entirely in one of the seven colors of the rainbow. No one is especially gruntled by their accommodations: Cookie Monster longs for a green cookie to go well with his green room, while the Count von Count does not like his red room (not one little bit of it), Ernie is not too thrilled with his purple room, Oscar the Grouch finds himself trapped in a bright pink room, filled with flowers and hearts, while Bert longs for a beige room over an orange one, Betty Lou is blinded by yellow, and even Grover finds himself depressed by his matching blue room. The group rapidly depart the next morning, happy to leave the weird house and return. The Sesame Street residents are unaware that the House of Seven Colors is in fact a tourist attraction, frequented by vast car and busloads of monsters who feel right at home in rooms that match their fur.",
    " The novel is narrated by Alexias, a noble Athenian youth, who becomes a noted beauty in the city and a champion runner. The novel suggests that young male Athenians were treated almost like modern debutantes and wooed by older men seeking to be their lovers; in fact, in a memorable passage, Alexias' father, Myron, himself a former beauty and champion athlete, writes to his son before leaving Athens for the Sicilian Expedition. The father imparts to the son the traits he should seek in a lover – qualities like honor, loyalty and courage. However, the father also warns the son not to become involved with women as he is much too young. (See Athenian pederasty.) The book implies that Myron had been Alcibiades' lover when the latter was a teenager, and felt that the way that Alcibiades turned out was at partly Myron's fault at least, as it was his responsibility as a lover to teach his eromenos virtue. As an Ephebe (adolescent male), Alexias falls in love with Lysis, a man in his 20s – a champion pankratiast and a student of Socrates. The novel follows their the relationship through the Peloponnesian War, the surrender of Athens, the establishment of the Thirty Tyrants rule over Athens, the democratic rebellion of Thrasybulus and shortly after. The story ends with first hints of the eventual trial of Socrates for teaching blasphemy and sowing social disorder. From the beginning of the novel, Socrates figures prominently; both Alexis and Lysis become his students in their youth. Also characterized in the novel are Plato and several figures from his Dialogues who were Socrates' students, including Xenophon. Another historical figure who figures in the story, albeit mostly off-stage, is Alcibiades, the Athenian general who flees Athens on a charge of sacrilege and functions as a military adviser to Sparta until he is recalled by a resurgent democracy in Athens. Alexis and Lysis serve under Alcibiades' command until his carelessness leads the fleet to disaster and he once again goes into exile. In the course of the novel, Lysis falls in love with and marries a woman who sees Alexias favorably and encourages the continuation of her husband's relationship with him. Not long after this, Athens is defeated by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Alexias' father is murdered under the Spartan-installed tyranny, and he and Lysis go into exile in Thebes joining Thrasybulus when he leads the next democratic revolt. Lysis is killed in the battle between the Long Walls running from the port of Piraeus to Athens (the Battle of Munychia). Shortly after the victory, Alexias takes Lysis' widow under his protection, marries her and continues his family line. The book ends with the postscript that this story (incomplete and long-forgotten) has been found by Alexias' grandson (also named Alexias), a commander of Athenian cavalry in the service of Alexander the Great.",

    " Jango begins with Seeker, Morning Star and Wildman who are all being taught in the Nom and are near the end of their training. Their teacher, Chance, mentions the secret skill of a Noble Warrior, and tells them a new teacher will be assigned to them to help them attain this secret skill. He then hands them over to Miriander, who puts them through training to learn how to control another's will by using lir. Once this training is over, it is discovered that Seeker has power without limits. Unlike the other Noble Warriors, he is able to suck the lir out of any living thing and doesn't get weary doing so. He fights and defeats Chance. Afterwards, he is told to stay in one place while the Elder and the council of the Nomana decide what to do with him, as they feel that they should not loose such power in the world, yet he might be the one the save the Nomana. In the trees of the forest called the Glimmen lives Echo Kittle who is described as being pale, slender and beautiful. She is captured by the Orlan leader, Amroth Jahan, who intends to arrange a marriage between her and one of his sons. She refuses to do so until the Jahan threatens to burn down the Glimmen and kill everyone in it. She decides to go along with them and soon they arrive in Radiance, which is led by Soren Similin. After a series of events taking up more than half the book, Similin manages to form an alliance between the Jahan and Radiance so they can destroy Anacrea with the use of charged water, which has huge explosive power. Neither the Jahan or Radiance intends to share the victory with the other. In his cell, Seeker is told by a Noma, Narrow Path, that the council of the Nom has decided to cleanse Seeker. Narrow Path believes this is the wrong decision and, knowing that he himself will be cleansed for this act, sets Seeker free, and tells him that he must go and fight the true threat; the Savanters, whom live in the land cloud. Seeker heads off to the land cloud, which is on the opposite side of the Glimmen, and on the way there he meets Jango sitting by a strange door in a broken down wall. At first, Jango seems to be a crazy old man, until he begins citing many of Seeker's personal thoughts. He gives Seeker much cryptic advice on how to defeat the Savanters and cites Noman's famous quote. (see Noman's experiment). Seeker continues on his way through the Glimmen but is stopped by Echo Kittle who has escaped from the Orlans in Radiance. She pleads with Seeker to help her defend the Glimmen from the Orlans but Seeker, knowing that he has little time left, refuses and carries on his way into the land cloud. There he kills five out of seven savanters but he is told to go back by a black figure, pretending to be his shadow. Seeker feels that something bad is happening at the Nom so he runs back as fast as he can. When Seeker arrives back at the Nom, the army of Orlans has already attacked and the charged water bomb ready to blow up the city, although Seeker doesn't know this. Seeker drives his power into the ground, causing an earthquake that stopped the battle in an instant, but the charged water bomb had already been launched at Anacrea and destroyed it, along with the Garden and the Lost Child. Seeker gets angry and takes revenge on the Jahan by breaking his pride, forcing him to kneel to Echo Kittle. The army of Orlans breaks up and Soren Similin dies from a charged water explosion. Seeker heads out in search of a purpose and runs across Jango, who is standing before a door. Jango says the door is open and he can enter if he wishes. Before he enters, he is told by Jango that there are many more Noms, and so he realizes the All and Only is not dead. The book is ended when Seeker enters the strange door next to Jango and enters an exact replica of the Nom's Garden that he was used to. He kneels down and asks for forgiveness for disbelieving in him after the destruction of the Nom.",
    " Mixing history and legend, it presents a situation in which pagan and Christianized Basques unite under the first king of Navarre and ally with Pelayo, the first king of Asturias to defend Catholic Iberia against the invading hordes of Islam. Amaya is a Christian noblewoman, daughter of a Basque woman and Ranimiro, the ruthless Visigoth general. She is a niece to pagan leader Amagoya, who prefers her other pagan niece as heiress to the secrets of Aitor, the Basque ancestral patriarch. Pacomio is a machinating Jew conspirating in disguise among Muslims, Visigoths and Basques. Eudes, duke of Cantabria, is Pacomio's son, but, by hiding his Jewish origin, has reached a high post in the Visigoth kingdom and aspires to power beyond what his allies and his father would allow. At the end, the secret of Aitor is revealed, to recommend Christianity, the pagan Basques (except for Amagoya) convert, and Amaya marries the Basque resistance leader, García, becoming the first monarchs of Navarre.

    " It is the story of a young Bengali man’s adventures in Africa in the years 1909-1910. Shankar, the protagonist, is a 20 year old man, recently graduated from college and about to take up a job in a jute mill, a prospect he absolutely loathes. He yearns for adventure, wild lands, forests and animals. He wants to follow the footsteps of famous explorers like Livingstone, Mungo Park, Marco Polo, all of whom he has read about and idolizes. By a stroke of luck, he secures a job as a clerk in Uganda Railways through a fellow villager already working there and goes to Africa without a second thought. There, he spends a few months laying rail tracks but soon encounters the first of many dangers of Pre-World War I Africa—man-eating lions. Later he takes up a job as station master in desolate station. Here he encounters the another hazard in Africa: the poisonous black mamba. He also rescues and looks after the middle-aged Portuguese explorer and gold prospector, Diego Alvarez. The encounter with Alavarez influences him deeply. Alavarez tells him of his earlier exploits and adventures, how he and his companion Jim Carter had braved deep jungles and mountains of Richtersveld to find the largest diamond mine. However, they were thwarted by the legendary Bunyip, a mythical monster which guards the mines which killed Carter. Shankar gives up his job and accompanies Alvarez as he decides to venture out once more and find the mines again. They meet with innumerable hardships, a raging volcano being the greatest challenge. Eventually they get lost in the forests where Alvarez is killed by a mysterious monster, the same that had taken Carter’s life, the Bunyip. Shankar sets out to reach civilization. He finds the Bunyip's cave and the diamond mines by accident. He enters the cave but eventually gets lost. With great difficulty, he gets out, marking his way with \"pebbles\" and taking some back with him as memento, not knowing each is a piece of uncut diamond. He finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave he found earlier really was the diamond mine. Gatti, as Shankar learns from a note by him, had uncut diamonds in his boots. The note said that whoever reads the note can take the diamonds as long as he buries his skeleton, with Christian rites. Shankar does so, and keeps the old diamonds. He becomes lost in the deserts of Kalahari and nearly dies of thirst. Fortunately he is rescued by a survey team, and taken to a hospital in Salisbury, Rhodesia, from where he sets sail for home. He ends the book saying that he will return to that cave one day with a large team, and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter and Gatti.",
    "Robert De Niro has completed a transatlantic box office double by topping the UK and US film charts with two different films at the same time.\nComedy sequel Meet the Fockers, in which he stars with Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, shot to the top of the UK chart at the weekend. It took £7.2m in three days - eight times more than the number two, Closer. Assault on Precinct 13 was in third. At the same time, US audiences were won over by his new thriller Hide and Seek. In Meet the Fockers, he picks up the role of an uptight father and ex-CIA agent from 2000 hit comedy, Meet the Parents.\nIt is a big leap to his role in Hide and Seek, a supernatural horror in which he plays a widower whose daughter's imaginary friend turns nasty. In the UK box office chart, Meet the Fockers pushed Closer off the top spot while police action movie Assault On Precinct 13, starring rapper Ja Rule, made £750,000 in its first weekend. London Underground thriller Creep was another new entry at six while quirky comedy Sideways, which got five Oscar nominations last week, entered in eighth place. The Oscar nominations do not seem to have had an impact on fans' choices at cinemas. Leading contenders The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Ray all suffered substantial drops in takings compared with the previous weekend.",
    "The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy (DOE) lab. DOE test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The current top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocks up 35.86. Due next week, the Top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second. The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles.\nThe US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the Linpack benchmark. Until the official list is published, however, Blue Gene/L's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries. But the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. Surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time.\nThe IBM Blue Gene/L is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the Livermore labs in 2005. Its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. The final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. The Earth Simulator has held on to the top spot since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. But in September, IBM said that another Blue Gene/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulator's performance. This was achieved during internal testing at IBM's production facility in Rochester, Minnesota, though, so was not an official record. Another giant to enter the fray is Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California. It would be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in October.\nSupercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. Their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis. IBM's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, Nick Donofrio, believes that by 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing. This means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second. \"When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world,\" Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website.\n\"You can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative.\" One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing - and Blue Gene machines in particular - as crucial is health. He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st Century: protein folding. \"Health is one of the most important problems, not just mapping the human genome, but also protein structures. \"We are a great believer in simulation. It gives you another tool,\" he said. Once the structures of proteins are understood fully, then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively. Compared with the current fastest supercomputers, Blue Gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact. Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.\nContrack International, of Arlington, Virginia, heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. Its withdrawal from the $325m (£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon's Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack's management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\nUS firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"",
    "The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.\nCommission officials are to look at Rome's provision of a 400m euro ($495m; £275m) loan to the carrier. Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. The investigation could take up to 18 months. However, Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot said he wanted it to be carried out as swiftly as possible. \"The Italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan,\" said Mr Barot. \"We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. I would like our analysis to be completed swiftly.\"\nThe matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia. While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. Alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. It plans to split into AZ Fly and AZ Services, which will handle air and ground services respectively. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. EU rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the \"one time, last time\" rule for airlines. Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. The airline declined to comment on the Commission decision.",
    "Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.\nThe Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be \"limited\". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and \"add-ons\" that the software giant offers.\nPeople who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.\nMicrosoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. \"It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,\" he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. \"China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,\" said Mr Cluley.",
    "The debut of US television hit Desperate Housewives has helped lift Channel 4's January audience share by 12% compared to last year.\nOther successes such as Celebrity Big Brother and The Simpsons have enabled the broadcaster to surpass BBC2 for the first month since last July. However the channel's share of the audience fell from 11.2% to 9.6% last month in comparison with January 2004. Celebrity Big Brother attracted less viewers than its 2002 series.\nComedy drama Desperate Housewives managed to pull in five million viewers at one point during its run to date, attracting a quarter of the television audience. The two main television channels, BBC1 and ITV1, have both seen their monthly audience share decline in a year on year comparison for January, while Five's proportion remained the same at a slender 6.3%. Digital multi-channel TV is continuing to be the strongest area of growth, with the BBC reporting Freeview box ownership of five million, including one million sales in the last portion of 2004. Its share of the audience soared by 20% in January 2005 compared with last year, and currently stands at an average of 28.6%.",
    "Video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004.\nGamers spent more than £1.34bn in 2004, almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the UK gaming industry's trade body. Sales records were smashed by the top title of the year GTA: San Andreas - in which players got the job of turning central character CJ into a crime boss. The game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale. This feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the UK. Although only released in November the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. There were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies. Five titles, including Sony EyeToy Play and EA's Need for Speed: Underground 2, managed this feat according to figures compiled by Chart-Track for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (Elspa). Electronic Arts, the world's biggest games publisher, had 9 games in the top 20.\n2004 was a \"stellar year\" said Roger Bennett, director general of Elspa. \"In a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,\" he said. Part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. Halo, The Sims, Driver, Need for Speed, Fifa football, Burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. Despite this fondness for older games, Doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. Movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. Games linked to Shrek, The Incredibles, Spider-Man, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings were all in the top 20. Elspa noted that sales of Xbox games rose 37.9% during the year. However, Sony's PlayStation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the £1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. Despite winning awards and rave reviews Half-Life 2 did not appear in the list. This was because it was only released on PC and, compared to console titles, sold in relatively small numbers. Also the novel distribution system adopted by developer Valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. Valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.",

    "French president Jacques Chirac has called the UK's £3bn rebate from the European Union \"unjustified\".\nSpeaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the EU would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. He said it remained justified because less EU farm money came to the UK.\nMr Chirac told reporters in Brussels: \"One can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the British cheque. It can no longer be justified. It was from the past.\" But a UK Government official responded: \"Even with the rebate, the UK pays two and a half times more than France contributes to the EU budget. Without it we would pay 14 times as much as France. \"There can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.\"\nThe 25-member EU is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013, with the bloc's Luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a June summit. Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a \"crucial test\" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain. EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.\nThe UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. Mr Straw has said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: \"I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe.\n\"The UK is already one of the biggest net contributors to the EU .\" The foreign secretary meanwhile said the \"justice\" of the rebate remained. \"We have one of the lowest net receipts of any EU country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. \"That continues to be the case.\"\nUK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was \"set in stone\" and there was no reason to negotiate about it. \"It is extraordinary to do it at this time, just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the EU. If we lose our rebate as well, the British taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that I think everyone will go off the European project.\" EU leaders are holding talks in Brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish European economy. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is meeting his EU counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the European Constitution. The plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. Critics - including Germany and France - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in Eastern Europe, undercutting large EU economies and undermining social protections. There are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern European countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in Germany.\nMr Straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate. \"European countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods,\" he said. \"What we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.\" Britain's low unemployment meant there was less \"neurosis\" about people coming from eastern European countries. \"In countries like Germany and France, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in,\" he said.",
    "China lent Russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.\nThe Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China's CNPC.\nAccording to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk's former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. \"The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,\" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. \"There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.\"\nThe announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.\nThe embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country's richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\nThe deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China's thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. \"Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],\" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. \"They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.\" \"If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,\" Mr Lukashov continued. \"And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it's a good deal for them too.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "(after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)\nJohn Arne Riise volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but Steven Gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. Blues boss Jose Mourinho was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. Drogba and Kezman scored from close range before Antonio Nunez's header made for a tense finale. It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager. Yet it was controversial too, after Mourinho's sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.\nRiise could not have connected any better with Morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past Petr Cech. The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampard's powerfully-struck drive and Drogba's low shot. Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpool's well-organised defence.\nJoe Cole had a shot blocked and a promising Damien Duff break was halted by a good tackle from Djimi Traore, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from Gudjohnsen's header, then to smother William Gallas' follow-up. And despite Chelsea's possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as Luis Garcia fed Dietmar Hamann whose shot forced a superb save from Cech. And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. That prompted Mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and Duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. Dudek saved bravely at the Irishman's feet, while Milan Baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. Drogba almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. But seconds after the half-time interval, Drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from Glen Johnson's long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. And Kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after Gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.\nDudek, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore (Biscan 67), Luis Garcia, Gerrard, Hamann, Riise, Kewell (Nunez 56), Morientes (Baros 74).\nSubs Not Used: Pellegrino, Carson.\nHyypia, Traore, Hamann, Carragher.\nRiise 1, Nunez 113.\nCech, Paulo Ferreira, Ricardo Carvalho, Terry, Gallas (Kezman 74), Jarosik (Gudjohnsen 45), Lampard, Makelele, Cole (Johnson 81), Drogba, Duff.\nSubs Not Used: Pidgeley, Tiago.\nLampard, Kezman, Drogba, Duff.\nGerrard 79 og, Drogba 107, Kezman 112.\n78,000\nS Bennett (Kent).",
    "The Conservative Party would deal \"sympathetically\" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.\nDr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for \"vindictiveness\" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.\nA jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.\nHe won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. Dr Fox was asked if he would say yes or no if Lord Archer applied to rejoin. \"I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. \"I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell.\"\nTory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. \"After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,\" he added. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. He said: \"I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. But there is no doubt it would be controversial.\" Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.",
    "Investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced.\nEighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\nFurther details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. \"This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,\" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA's 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another's share prices.\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned.\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to end its Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) on midnight of 31 December. Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\nIt added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.",

    "Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a \"super union\" of two million members.\nThe move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that \"nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda\" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday.

    "Tony Blair should set out a proper exit strategy from Iraq in the wake of next Sunday's elections in the country, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.\nIn a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of George W Bush, Mr Kennedy said Iraq had become a \"crucible of militant terrorism\". He wants to see a phased withdrawal of UK troops \"as soon as the situation allows\", he said in London. Any exit strategy must \"augment and support\" the democratic process.\n\"There are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of British and American troops in Iraq feeds the insurgency,\" he said. \"There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.\" Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal \"regardless of the situation on the ground\".\nHe accused Mr Blair's government of \"being less than straightforward\" over its plans. \"Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq,\" Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech. \"He should set out a proper exit strategy, including the phased withdrawal of British troops, as the security situation allows.\" Mr Kennedy also argued that British troops deployed in Iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - \"especially Islamic countries\".",
    "Amelie Mauresmo and Maria Sharapova won their opening matches at the Tour Championships in Los Angeles.\nFrance's Mauresmo routed Vera Zvonareva 6-1 6-0, while Wimbledon champion Sharapova was a 6-1 6-4 winner over fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. American Serena Williams also won, edging Russian Elena Dementieva 7-6 7-5 for her second victory of the event. The event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.\nMauresmo's win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the number one spot. Mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the US Open before injury ushered Davenport back in front. \"Since then, I feel very confident on court and my game is there. I want to get the ranking back, but it's very different than before I was number one. \"It was an obsession, but now I take it in a relaxed way.\" Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russia's Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.\n\"She got mad a little bit and I played some great tennis,\" said Mauresmo, who was runner-up to Kim Clijsters in last year's final. Zvonareva has lost both her games so far, having crashed 6-2 6-4 Kuznetsova in the Staples Centre on Wednesday. \"Sometimes not everything works,\" she said. \"It was lots of pressure. Maybe that is why I couldn't do 100%. But I was fighting.\" Sharapova, who lost 6-2 6-2 to Kuznetsova in Beijing in September, said: \"In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable. \"This time, it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.\" The tournament debutant added: \"I love it here. The atmosphere is great. \"To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball.\" Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. \"It's hard to go out there and get it right but I'm fighting and I'm hoping,\" said Williams. \"What makes me happy is the effort.

Money raised will go to the Fondation pour l'Enfance (Foundation for Childhood) which aims to rebuild a children's shelter in Sri Lanka. Sir Elton played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his wife Anne-Aymone.

    "A Labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the Royal Family the same rights as males.\nThe legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the Crown. It would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. But the government refused to back Lord Dubs' Succession to the Crown Bill, saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues.\nThe Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, agreed the 1701 Act of Settlement, which governs the succession, was discriminatory but added that \"for all practical purposes its effects are limited\".\nThe changes proposed by Lord Dubs were a \"complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues\", he said. Lord Falconer said there were 22 members of the Royal Family in the line of succession after the Prince of Wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act. \"It is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. While we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn't the proper form,\" he added.\nHe did not rule out change in the future but said if Lord Dubs' private member's bill was passed by peers, he would urge MPs to oppose it in the Commons. Lord Dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the House of Lords, but urged the government to think again at a later stage. \"We cannot forever say we don't want to change things because it is too difficult,\" he told peers. During the debate, the Labour peer and former minister said: \"The monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. \"What we don't want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times. \"We are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against Catholics.\" But opponents of the bill, including Tory Lord Campbell of Alloway and the Bishop of Winchester, the Rt Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, said it would separate the state from both the Church of England and the Christian faith. Such a \"secular\" state would be markedly \"less tolerant\", Rt Rev Scott-Joynt argued.",
    "The UK' opposition Conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the General Election. Here's a guide to the plan:\nPeople coming to live and work in Britain from outside the EU. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of TB, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the European Union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.\nTuberculosis, Hepatitis B and HIV. A positive test for TB would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.\nPeople would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the UK, or impose significant costs or demands on the NHS. They would also, if appropriate, have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.\nPeople coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching. Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB. Under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and HIV.\nThe Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health. However, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.\nThey claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. They also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into Britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. They say the plans will protect access to the NHS.\nApplicants will be tested in their home country. Only asylum seekers will be tested in the UK once their refugee status is established.\nHome Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries. Recent medical checks were carried out on 175,000 people at Heathrow Airport and 10,000 at Gatwick. From those tests, about 100 infectious cases of TB were found.\nThe Tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. The party has looked at the way the system is operated in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Tory proposals are \"quite closely modelled\" on the New Zealand system.\nLabour claims the policy is little more than a \"desperate attempt to catch up with Labour's five-year plan\" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week. This says health screening for TB will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. The Liberal Democrats have warned Labour and the Tories they were \"in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it\".",
    "Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.\nLG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. The firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in January 2004, which gave control to the creditors. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card's plastic for purchases.\nLG Card's creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.\n\"Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,\" said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm's major creditors. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. It says it wants \"fair and reasonable guidelines\" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said. Analysts believe a compromise is likely. \"LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,\" said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.\nLG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. LG card's creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. \"Eventually, LG Group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,\" said Mr Kim.",
    "Plans to portray Dominica's Carib Indians as cannibals in the sequel to hit film Pirates of the Caribbean have been criticised by the group's chief.\nCarib Chief Charles Williams said talks with Disney's producers revealed there was \"a strong element of cannibalism in the script which cannot be removed\". The Caribbean island's government said Disney planned to film in Dominica. The Caribs have long denied their ancestors practised cannibalism. Disney was unavailable for comment. \"Our ancestors stood up against early European conquerors and because they stood up...we were labelled savages and cannibals up to today,\" said Mr Williams.\n\"This cannot be perpetuated in movies.\" Shooting on the sequel is expected to begin in April, with hundreds of Dominicans applying to be extras in the movie.\nAbout 3,000 Caribs live on the island of Dominica, which has a population of 70,000. Many Caribs were killed by disease and war during colonisation up to the 1600s. Mr Williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film. But he admitted there were some members of the Carib council who did not support the campaign. He said some did not \"understand our history, they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the Carib people\".

She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. At first, White claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions.\n\"My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product,\" White said in the LA Times. \"Whether it be a good product or a bad product, he was selling a product.\" White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case. The 27-year-old believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning. \"I have no clue what it's going to take to change that,\" said White. \"I would say I made a mistake and I would never, ever go back. \"I would never recommend anyone to take that route.\"",
    "Tony Blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on Monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 May.\nThe date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted. Over the weeks, there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day Mr Blair would go for an historic third term. And the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. The prime minister and his campaign boss Alan Milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between Labour's stability and investment against Tory cuts and boom and bust.\nAnd Chancellor Gordon Brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in Westminster - to underline that economic message. And it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.\nDuring the phoney campaign, Labour got into trouble over its central claim that Michael Howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. The prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the Tories compared to Labour's plans was a cut. And it looked like the Labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by Mr Howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. Then deputy Conservative Chairman Howard Flight was reported to have suggested Mr Howard was secretly planning even bigger \"cuts\".\nHe was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering Labour campaign was back on track. A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again. Mr Brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. As usual, the Liberal Democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. But leader Charles Kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. Other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum, the war on Iraq, law and order and education, for example. But, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. And, whatever that outcome, 2005 is set to be a far more lively, even bitter campaign than 2001's non-event.",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "Celtic's Neil Lennon admits Rangers could be considered \"slight favourites\" for the Old Firm CIS Cup clash, but insists his side can still win.\nLennon concedes Rangers are in good form at the moment, but they have failed to beat Celtic in their last seven meetings. \"Rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks,\" he said. \"But it's a game we believe we're capable of winning if we play our best,\" he told the Evening Times. \"All the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in. \"Without playing at the top of our game, we have still been winning matches. \"At the minute, we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in Europe, so I don't think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out. \"Of course, it is a concern when you are losing goals, because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets, but hopefully we are over that wee run. \"Considering we lost Henrik Larsson at the end of last season, we have still been scoring a lot of goals, which is pleasing.\"",
    "US retail giant Federated Department Stores is to buy rival May Department Stores for $11bn (£5.7bn).\nThe deal will bring together famous stores like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Field's, creating the largest department store chain in the US. The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn. The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May's chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January. As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's - will assume $6bn of May's debt, bringing the deal's total value to $17bn. Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.\nMay has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as Federated and other retailers such as Wal-Mart. Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.\n\"We have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in America, creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence,\" said Terry Lundgren, Federated's chairman. Some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for May. \"Without this deal May would have been, to put it bluntly, washed up,\" said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group. Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while May's yearly sales are $14.4bn.",
    "Juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O'Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic.\nBrian Hassell says no official approach has been received from Manchester City but that the English club had been earmarked as a possible destination. But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O'Neill's first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would \"desperately like to stay at Celtic\" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted.\nThe agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old's father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho's father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. \"I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn't want to go there,\" said Hassel. \"He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic.\" Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. \"It was a thought at one stage,\" he said. \"If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. \"He is a fan of Kevin Keegan's style of play. It would not be a bad move for him.\" Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: \"The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn't happened. \"If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. That would be good for the club and good for me. \"If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes.\" The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O'Neill since his move to Celtic Park. \"I can't understand why I am in this situation,\" he continued. \"When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support.\"",
    "Oscar-winner Andrea Arnold has been congratulated by the UK Film Council, the organisation which partly funded her project.\nArnold's film Wasp won the best live action short film award on Sunday. \"The UK Film Council spends millions of pounds of lottery investment on short filmmaking in Britain every year,\" said chief executive officer John Woodward. \"It certainly pays off when you see new film-makers winning such prestigious awards,\" he added.\nWasp, which was commissioned by the Film Council and Channel 4, beat films by fellow UK nominees Gary McKendry and Ashvin Kumar to the prize. It stars actress Nathalie Press, who appeared in the Bafta-winning drama My Summer Of Love, as a single mother who is forced to take drastic action when she is invited on a date and is unable to find a babysitter to look after her four daughters. The film has already won over 30 other international awards including the Sundance Short Film Prize. Arnold, from Dartford in Kent, described her victory as \"truly overwhelming. I'm really not used to this kind of thing,\" she said, after receiving her Oscar from actor Jeremy Irons. \"Thanks to everyone who worked on this - the beers are on me when we get home.\" The director was one of only two British winners on the night, the other being Sandy Powell, who won the costume design Oscar for her work on The Aviator.",
    "The last film to be made by the slain Dutch director Theo van Gogh, called 06/05, has been premiered in The Hague.\nMembers of Van Gogh's family and celebrities attended the screening of 06/05, based on the murder of the anti-immigration politician Pim Fortuyn. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in Amsterdam six weeks ago. A Dutch-Moroccan man suspected of radical Islamist links has been charged. The killing, and Fortuyn's death in 2002, convulsed the Netherlands. Many Dutch people have questioned their country's self-image as a peaceful, tolerant nation in the wake of the murders, which triggered heated debate about immigration.\nAn animal rights activist was sentenced to 18 years in prison last year for killing Fortuyn. Earlier this year, Van Gogh made a film accusing Islam of promoting violence against women. It caused outrage among Muslims and death threats were made against him. The film 06/05 will become available on the internet on Wednesday and go on general release in Dutch cinemas in January. Van Gogh's movie mixes real images of the day of Fortuyn's murder with a fictional plot about Dutch intelligence services conspiring to silence the politician. The story unfolds through the eyes of a freelance photographer who unwittingly takes pictures revealing the involvement of Dutch authorities in Fortuyn's murder. Photographer Jim de Booy then goes on the run from secret service agents who burgle his home and threaten his family.",
    "The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.\nThe Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn. The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn. The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.\nDemocrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.",
    "The world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.\nThe Wolong Nature Reserve in the Sichuan Province of southwest China is home to 20% of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world. A broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. The data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. The reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.\nUsing the network, vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs' chances of survival.\n\"Digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside Wolong and with the rest of the world,\" said Zhang Hemin, director of the Wolong Nature Reserve. \"Our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings.\" The network has been developed by Intel, working closely with the staff at Wolong. It includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.\nBefore the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park, staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. Infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. To foster cultural links across the globe, a children's learning lab has been incorporated in the network, in collaboration with Globio (Federation for Global Biodiversity Education for Children), an international non-profit organisation. It will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in Portland, Oregon in the US. \"Digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world,\" said Globio founder Gerry Ellis.",
    "The shape of the UK's economy In graphics\nBut he denied that he was ruling out British membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year. Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future. Otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of China, he told MPs.\nThe chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.\nUnder Mr Brown's rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit. He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rules \"make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure\". But he argued that the EU was moving in the direction of the UK principles, and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year, to include investment, and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year. Under Mr Brown's \"sustainable investment\" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.\nMr Brown vigorously denied Conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. In March the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassified £3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only £6bn. Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter. But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was \"impugning the integrity\" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. Mr Brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap. He told the Treasury Select Committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost Treasury coffers.\nEarlier, ex-Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more \"rigid\" rules. But fellow Tory David Heathcoat-Amory said the folly of the system was in trying to run Europe's varied economies on one set of rules. \"The essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake,\" he said. \"The warning is about the European constitution, which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two, and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. It gives more powers to Brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy.\" But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. \"The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,\" Mr. Brown said.",
    "A call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and Asian MPs has been rejected by one of Labour's most senior Asians.\nShahid Malik, who is on Labour's ruling NEC, accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. Just 13 of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists. That came after it emerged that one of Britain's most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.\nMr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. \"If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,\" he said. He added: \"It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didn't have a minority candidate.\" Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.\nBut he argued: \"I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren't doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective.\" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as \"painful\". \"I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasn't worked,\" she said. \"The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people.\" On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was \"ambitious\" to improve black and Asian representation. \"We haven't ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this,\" he said.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "The stage adaptation of children's film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in London's West End.\nSir Cameron Mackintosh's lavish production, which has cost £9m to bring to the stage, was given a 10-minute standing ovation. Lead actress Laura Michelle Kelly soared over the heads of the audience holding the nanny's trademark umbrella. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins' flight into the auditorium during preview performances. A number of celebrities turned out for the musical's premiere, including actress Barbara Windsor, comic Graham Norton and Sir Richard Attenborough.\nThe show's director Richard Eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney's 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.",
    "A British author has had the film rights to her children's bestseller snapped up for a seven-figure sum, with Ridley Scott set to direct.\nMichelle Paver's Wolf Brother, a fantasy set 6,000 years ago, is the first in a planned series of six books. Film studio Fox has bought the rights for around $4m (£2.13m) for Scott's company Scott Free to develop. The director said he was \"thrilled\" with the project. \"Wolf Brother is an enchanting book,\" he said. Paver, who lives in London and previously worked as a lawyer, began writing the book in 1982 while studying biochemistry at Oxford University.\nShe was an established author of love stories when she turned the work-in-progress into a children's novel. It was published in 2004, with Paver earning an advance of $5m (£2.8m) - the highest sum ever paid for a debut children's book. Wolf Brother tells the story of Torak, a 12-year-old hunter who lives in the forest. After his father is killed he teams up with a wolf cub and sets out to rid the forest of an evil force. Paver is currently writing the second book in the series. \"Michelle Paver lives and breathes the worlds she writes about,\" said a spokesman for the author. \"I've told her about the film deal but at the moment she is writing the second book and her mind is 6000 years away deep in the primeval forest.\"",
    "The US dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on Friday as concern grows about the size of the US budget deficit.\nAnalysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. The Bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. However, trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. This has amplified reactions to news, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in January.\nThe dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on Friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on Thursday. One dollar bought 102.55 yen.\nDisappointing business figures from Chicago triggered the US currency's weakness on Thursday. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2, a bigger fall than expected. \"There are no dollar buyers now, especially after the Chicago data yesterday,\" said ABN Amro's Paul Mackel. At the same time, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was \"absolutely worrying\" for Italian exports. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. Investors will now look towards February's meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised nations in London for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar's decline.",
    "The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US.\nNew Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (£130,000) fine.\nIn a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 \"sound recordings\" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting \"criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks\". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April.",

Get Me Out of Here drew an average of 10.9m viewers - about four million fewer than the previous series.\nThe fourth series of the show peaked on Monday at 11.9m and 49.2% of the audience, just before Joe Pasquale won. This compared with a peak of 15.3m at and a record 62.2% of the TV audience when Kerry McFadden won in February. Comic Pasquale beat former Royal butler Paul Burrell who came second, nightclub owner Fran Cosgrave, who was third. Pasquale follows Kerry McFadden, Phil Tufnell and Tony Blackburn as winners of the show.\nSinger and TV presenter McFadden was the show's first female winner. When cricketer Phil Tufnell won in May 2003, 12.3 million people - 50% of the viewing public - tuned in to watch. And when Tony Blackburn won the first show in 2002, 10.9 million people saw the show. Pasquale had been the show's hottest ever favourite to win, and its hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, known as Ant and Dec, said Monday's deciding vote was the closest in the programme's history.\nPascuale has been flooded with offers of TV work, according to his management company, but one of his first jobs on his return is pantomime.\nBefore joining I'm a Celebrity, he had signed up to play Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk in Birmingham, and tickets for the show have become increasingly popular since he joined the TV show.

The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.",
    "An Iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries.\nArash Sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. Mr Sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area. His sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, comes a day after an online \"day of action\" to secure his release. Iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs, restricting access to major blogging sites from within Iran. A second Iranian blogger, Motjaba Saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests, is still being held.\nA spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi's sentence as \"harsh\" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. \"The authorities are trying to make an example of him,\" the organisation said in a statement.\n\"By handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger, their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media.\" In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the BBC Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda. Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. They accused Mr Sigarchi of a string of crimes against Iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of Iran's Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr Sigarchi's lawyer labelled the revolutionary court \"illegal and incompetent\" and called for a retrial in a public court.\nMr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world.\nThe Committee to Protect Bloggers designated 22 February 2005 as Free Mojtaba and Arash Day. Around 10,000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. About 12% of users were based in Iran, the campaign's director told the BBC News website. Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. \"The eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on Iran since Sigarchi's sentence, not less. \"The mullahs won't be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere.\"",
    "Newcastle manager Graeme Souness is closing in on signing Chelsea defender Celestine Babayaro when the transfer window reopens.\nSouness is bidding to bolster his defence and, according to reports, contract negotiations are at an advanced stage with the player. Babayaro has been in the Premiership since 1997 when he moved to Chelsea for £2.25m from Anderlecht. But the 26-year-old has been surplus to requirements this season. Souness would not be drawn on specifics over individual players.\nBut he said: \"All I can tell you is that the chairman has worked really hard in the last couple of months to try to do deals. \"We have said from day one we want to strengthen, and that is what we are hoping to do in the coming weeks.\"",
    "In a sign of a thaw in relations between Egypt and Israel, the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the US, allowing Egyptian goods made in partnership with Israeli firms free access to American markets.\nThe protocol, signed in Cairo, will establish what are called \"qualified industrial zones\" in Egypt. Products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the US, provided that 35% of their components are the product of Israeli-Egyptian cooperation. The US describes this as the most important economic agreement between Egypt and Israel in two decades.\nThe protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years. There has been deep sensitivity in Egypt about any form of co-operation with Israel as long as its peace process with the Palestinians remains blocked. But in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. Both exchanged prisoners earlier this month, with Egypt handing back an Israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.\nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak has described Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as the best chance for the Palestinians to achieve peace. The government in Cairo now believes Mr Sharon is moving towards the centre and away from the positions of right wing groups. It also believes the US, pressed by Europe, is now more willing to engage seriously in the search for a settlement. But there are also pressing economic reasons for Egypt's decision to enter into the trade agreement. It will give a huge boost to Egyptian textile exports, which are about to suffer a drop after new regulations come into force in the US at the beginning of the year.",
    "Life insurer Axa Sun Life has lowered annual bonus payouts for up to 50,000 with-profits investors.\nRegular annual bonus rates on former Axa Equity & Law with-profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004. Axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002. The cut will hit an estimated 3% of Axa's policyholders. The rest will know their fate in March.\nThe cuts on Axa's policies will mean a policyholder who had invested £50 a month into an endowment policy for the past 25 years would see a final maturity payout of £46,998. This equated to a annual investment growth rate of 8% Axa said. With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. However, heavy stock market falls throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. \"The stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002,\" Axa spokesman Mark Hamilton, Axa spokesman, told BBC News. Axa cut payouts for the same investors last January.",

Awake,\nMy fairest, my espoused, my latest found,\nHeaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!\nAwake:  The morning shines, and the fresh field\nCalls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring\nOur tender plants, how blows the citron grove,\nWhat drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,\nHow nature paints her colours, how the bee\nSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.\nSuch whispering waked her, but with startled eye\nOn Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.\nO sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,\nMy glory, my perfection! glad I see\nThy face, and morn returned; for I this night\n(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,\nIf dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,\nWorks of day past, or morrow's next design,\nBut of offence and trouble, which my mind\nKnew never till this irksome night:  Methought,\nClose at mine ear one called me forth to walk\nWith gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said,\n'Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,\n'The cool, the silent, save where silence yields\n'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake\n'Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns\n'Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light\n'Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,\n'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,\n'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?\n'In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment\n'Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.'\nI rose as at thy call, but found thee not;\nTo find thee I directed then my walk;\nAnd on, methought, alone I passed through ways\nThat brought me on a sudden to the tree\nOf interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,\nMuch fairer to my fancy than by day:\nAnd, as I wondering looked, beside it stood\nOne shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven\nBy us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled\nAmbrosia; on that tree he also gazed;\nAnd 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged,\n'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,\n'Nor God, nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised?\n'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?\n'Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold\n'Longer thy offered good; why else set here?\nThis said, he paused not, but with venturous arm\nHe plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled\nAt such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:\nBut he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine,\n'Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,\n'Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit\n'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:\n'And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more\n'Communicated, more abundant grows,\n'The author not impaired, but honoured more?\n'Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!\n'Partake thou also; happy though thou art,\n'Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:\n'Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods\n'Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,\n'But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes\n'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see\n'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!'\nSo saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,\nEven to my mouth of that same fruit held part\nWhich he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell\nSo quickened appetite, that I, methought,\nCould not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds\nWith him I flew, and underneath beheld\nThe earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide\nAnd various:  Wondering at my flight and change\nTo this high exaltation; suddenly\nMy guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,\nAnd fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked\nTo find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night\nRelated, and thus Adam answered sad.\nBest image of myself, and dearer half,\nThe trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep\nAffects me equally; nor can I like\nThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;\nYet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,\nCreated pure.  But know that in the soul\nAre many lesser faculties, that serve\nReason as chief; among these Fancy next\nHer office holds; of all external things\nWhich the five watchful senses represent,\nShe forms imaginations, aery shapes,\nWhich Reason, joining or disjoining, frames\nAll what we affirm or what deny, and call\nOur knowledge or opinion; then retires\nInto her private cell, when nature rests.\nOft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes\nTo imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,\nWild work produces oft, and most in dreams;\nIll matching words and deeds long past or late.\nSome such resemblances, methinks, I find\nOf our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,\nBut with addition strange; yet be not sad.\nEvil into the mind of God or Man\nMay come and go, so unreproved, and leave\nNo spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope\nThat what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,\nWaking thou never will consent to do.\nBe not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,\nThat wont to be more cheerful and serene,\nThan when fair morning first smiles on the world;\nAnd let us to our fresh employments rise\nAmong the groves, the fountains, and the flowers\nThat open now their choisest bosomed smells,\nReserved from night, and kept for thee in store.\nSo cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;\nBut silently a gentle tear let fall\nFrom either eye, and wiped them with her hair;\nTwo other precious drops that ready stood,\nEach in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell\nKissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse\nAnd pious awe, that feared to have offended.\nSo all was cleared, and to the field they haste.\nBut first, from under shady arborous roof\nSoon as they forth were come to open sight\nOf day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,\nWith wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,\nShot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,\nDiscovering in wide landskip all the east\nOf Paradise and Eden's happy plains,\nLowly they bowed adoring, and began\nTheir orisons, each morning duly paid\nIn various style; for neither various style\nNor holy rapture wanted they to praise\nTheir Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung\nUnmeditated; such prompt eloquence\nFlowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,\nMore tuneable than needed lute or harp\nTo add more sweetness; and they thus began.\nThese are thy glorious works, Parent of good,\nAlmighty!  Thine this universal frame,\nThus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then!\nUnspeakable, who sitst above these heavens\nTo us invisible, or dimly seen\nIn these thy lowest works; yet these declare\nThy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.\nSpeak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,\nAngels; for ye behold him, and with songs\nAnd choral symphonies, day without night,\nCircle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven\nOn Earth join all ye Creatures to extol\nHim first, him last, him midst, and without end.\nFairest of stars, last in the train of night,\nIf better thou belong not to the dawn,\nSure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn\nWith thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,\nWhile day arises, that sweet hour of prime.\nThou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,\nAcknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise\nIn thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,\nAnd when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.\nMoon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,\nWith the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;\nAnd ye five other wandering Fires, that move\nIn mystick dance not without song, resound\nHis praise, who out of darkness called up light.\nAir, and ye Elements, the eldest birth\nOf Nature's womb, that in quaternion run\nPerpetual circle, multiform; and mix\nAnd nourish all things; let your ceaseless change\nVary to our great Maker still new praise.\nYe Mists and Exhalations, that now rise\nFrom hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,\nTill the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,\nIn honour to the world's great Author rise;\nWhether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,\nOr wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,\nRising or falling still advance his praise.\nHis praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,\nBreathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,\nWith every plant, in sign of worship wave.\nFountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,\nMelodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.\nJoin voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds,\nThat singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,\nBear on your wings and in your notes his praise.\nYe that in waters glide, and ye that walk\nThe earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;\nWitness if I be silent, morn or even,\nTo hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,\nMade vocal by my song, and taught his praise.\nHail, universal Lord, be bounteous still\nTo give us only good; and if the night\nHave gathered aught of evil, or concealed,\nDisperse it, as now light dispels the dark!\nSo prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts\nFirm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.\nOn to their morning's rural work they haste,\nAmong sweet dews and flowers; where any row\nOf fruit-trees over-woody reached too far\nTheir pampered boughs, and needed hands to check\nFruitless embraces: or they led the vine\nTo wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines\nHer marriageable arms, and with him brings\nHer dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn\nHis barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld\nWith pity Heaven's high King, and to him called\nRaphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned\nTo travel with Tobias, and secured\nHis marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.\nRaphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth\nSatan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,\nHath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed\nThis night the human pair; how he designs\nIn them at once to ruin all mankind.\nGo therefore, half this day as friend with friend\nConverse with Adam, in what bower or shade\nThou findest him from the heat of noon retired,\nTo respite his day-labour with repast,\nOr with repose; and such discourse bring on,\nAs may advise him of his happy state,\nHappiness in his power left free to will,\nLeft to his own free will, his will though free,\nYet mutable; whence warn him to beware\nHe swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal\nHis danger, and from whom; what enemy,\nLate fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now\nThe fall of others from like state of bliss;\nBy violence? no, for that shall be withstood;\nBut by deceit and lies:  This let him know,\nLest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend\nSurprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.\nSo spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled\nAll justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint\nAfter his charge received; but from among\nThousand celestial Ardours, where he stood\nVeiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,\nFlew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,\nOn each hand parting, to his speed gave way\nThrough all the empyreal road; till, at the gate\nOf Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide\nOn golden hinges turning, as by work\nDivine the sovran Architect had framed.\nFrom hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,\nStar interposed, however small he sees,\nNot unconformed to other shining globes,\nEarth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned\nAbove all hills.  As when by night the glass\nOf Galileo, less assured, observes\nImagined lands and regions in the moon:\nOr pilot, from amidst the Cyclades\nDelos or Samos first appearing, kens\nA cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight\nHe speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky\nSails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing\nNow on the polar winds, then with quick fan\nWinnows the buxom air; till, within soar\nOf towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems\nA phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,\nWhen, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's\nBright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.\nAt once on the eastern cliff of Paradise\nHe lights, and to his proper shape returns\nA Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade\nHis lineaments divine; the pair that clad\nEach shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast\nWith regal ornament; the middle pair\nGirt like a starry zone his waist, and round\nSkirted his loins and thighs with downy gold\nAnd colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet\nShadowed from either heel with feathered mail,\nSky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood,\nAnd shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled\nThe circuit wide.  Straight knew him all the bands\nOf Angels under watch; and to his state,\nAnd to his message high, in honour rise;\nFor on some message high they guessed him bound.\nTheir glittering tents he passed, and now is come\nInto the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,\nAnd flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;\nA wilderness of sweets; for Nature here\nWantoned as in her prime, and played at will\nHer virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,\nWild above rule or art, enormous bliss.\nHim through the spicy forest onward come\nAdam discerned, as in the door he sat\nOf his cool bower, while now the mounted sun\nShot down direct his fervid rays to warm\nEarth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:\nAnd Eve within, due at her hour prepared\nFor dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please\nTrue appetite, and not disrelish thirst\nOf nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,\nBerry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called.\nHaste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold\nEastward among those trees, what glorious shape\nComes this way moving; seems another morn\nRisen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven\nTo us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe\nThis day to be our guest.  But go with speed,\nAnd, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour\nAbundance, fit to honour and receive\nOur heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford\nOur givers their own gifts, and large bestow\nFrom large bestowed, where Nature multiplies\nHer fertile growth, and by disburthening grows\nMore fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.\nTo whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould,\nOf God inspired! small store will serve, where store,\nAll seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;\nSave what by frugal storing firmness gains\nTo nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:\nBut I will haste, and from each bough and brake,\nEach plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice\nTo entertain our Angel-guest, as he\nBeholding shall confess, that here on Earth\nGod hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.\nSo saying, with dispatchful looks in haste\nShe turns, on hospitable thoughts intent\nWhat choice to choose for delicacy best,\nWhat order, so contrived as not to mix\nTastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring\nTaste after taste upheld with kindliest change;\nBestirs her then, and from each tender stalk\nWhatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields\nIn India East or West, or middle shore\nIn Pontus or the Punick coast, or where\nAlcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat\nRough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,\nShe gathers, tribute large, and on the board\nHeaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape\nShe crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths\nFrom many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed\nShe tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold\nWants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground\nWith rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.\nMean while our primitive great sire, to meet\nHis God-like guest, walks forth, without more train\nAccompanied than with his own complete\nPerfections; in himself was all his state,\nMore solemn than the tedious pomp that waits\nOn princes, when their rich retinue long\nOf horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,\nDazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.\nNearer his presence Adam, though not awed,\nYet with submiss approach and reverence meek,\nAs to a superiour nature bowing low,\nThus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place\nNone can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;\nSince, by descending from the thrones above,\nThose happy places thou hast deigned a while\nTo want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us\nTwo only, who yet by sovran gift possess\nThis spacious ground, in yonder shady bower\nTo rest; and what the garden choicest bears\nTo sit and taste, till this meridian heat\nBe over, and the sun more cool decline.\nWhom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.\nAdam, I therefore came; nor art thou such\nCreated, or such place hast here to dwell,\nAs may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,\nTo visit thee; lead on then where thy bower\nO'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,\nI have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge\nThey came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,\nWith flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,\nUndecked save with herself, more lovely fair\nThan Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned\nOf three that in mount Ida naked strove,\nStood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil\nShe needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm\nAltered her cheek.  On whom the Angel Hail\nBestowed, the holy salutation used\nLong after to blest Mary, second Eve.\nHail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb\nShall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,\nThan with these various fruits the trees of God\nHave heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf\nTheir table was, and mossy seats had round,\nAnd on her ample square from side to side\nAll autumn piled, though spring and autumn here\nDanced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;\nNo fear lest dinner cool; when thus began\nOur author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste\nThese bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom\nAll perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,\nTo us for food and for delight hath caused\nThe earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps\nTo spiritual natures; only this I know,\nThat one celestial Father gives to all.\nTo whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives\n(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part\nSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be found\nNo ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure\nIntelligential substances require,\nAs doth your rational; and both contain\nWithin them every lower faculty\nOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,\nTasting concoct, digest, assimilate,\nAnd corporeal to incorporeal turn.\nFor know, whatever was created, needs\nTo be sustained and fed:  Of elements\nThe grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,\nEarth and the sea feed air, the air those fires\nEthereal, and as lowest first the moon;\nWhence in her visage round those spots, unpurged\nVapours not yet into her substance turned.\nNor doth the moon no nourishment exhale\nFrom her moist continent to higher orbs.\nThe sun that light imparts to all, receives\nFrom all his alimental recompence\nIn humid exhalations, and at even\nSups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees\nOf life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines\nYield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn\nWe brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground\nCovered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here\nVaried his bounty so with new delights,\nAs may compare with Heaven; and to taste\nThink not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,\nAnd to their viands fell; nor seemingly\nThe Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss\nOf Theologians; but with keen dispatch\nOf real hunger, and concoctive heat\nTo transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires\nThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire\nOf sooty coal the empirick alchemist\nCan turn, or holds it possible to turn,\nMetals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,\nAs from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve\nMinistered naked, and their flowing cups\nWith pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence\nDeserving Paradise! if ever, then,\nThen had the sons of God excuse to have been\nEnamoured at that sight; but in those hearts\nLove unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy\nWas understood, the injured lover's hell.\nThus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,\nNot burdened nature, sudden mind arose\nIn Adam, not to let the occasion pass\nGiven him by this great conference to know\nOf things above his world, and of their being\nWho dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw\nTranscend his own so far; whose radiant forms,\nDivine effulgence, whose high power, so far\nExceeded human; and his wary speech\nThus to the empyreal minister he framed.\nInhabitant with God, now know I well\nThy favour, in this honour done to Man;\nUnder whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed\nTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,\nFood not of Angels, yet accepted so,\nAs that more willingly thou couldst not seem\nAt Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare\nTo whom the winged Hierarch replied.\nO Adam, One Almighty is, from whom\nAll things proceed, and up to him return,\nIf not depraved from good, created all\nSuch to perfection, one first matter all,\nEndued with various forms, various degrees\nOf substance, and, in things that live, of life;\nBut more refined, more spiritous, and pure,\nAs nearer to him placed, or nearer tending\nEach in their several active spheres assigned,\nTill body up to spirit work, in bounds\nProportioned to each kind.  So from the root\nSprings lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves\nMore aery, last the bright consummate flower\nSpirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,\nMan's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,\nTo vital spirits aspire, to animal,\nTo intellectual; give both life and sense,\nFancy and understanding; whence the soul\nReason receives, and reason is her being,\nDiscursive, or intuitive; discourse\nIs oftest yours, the latter most is ours,\nDiffering but in degree, of kind the same.\nWonder not then, what God for you saw good\nIf I refuse not, but convert, as you\nTo proper substance.  Time may come, when Men\nWith Angels may participate, and find\nNo inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;\nAnd from these corporal nutriments perhaps\nYour bodies may at last turn all to spirit,\nImproved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend\nEthereal, as we; or may, at choice,\nHere or in heavenly Paradises dwell;\nIf ye be found obedient, and retain\nUnalterably firm his love entire,\nWhose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy\nYour fill what happiness this happy state\nCan comprehend, incapable of more.\nTo whom the patriarch of mankind replied.\nO favourable Spirit, propitious guest,\nWell hast thou taught the way that might direct\nOur knowledge, and the scale of nature set\nFrom center to circumference; whereon,\nIn contemplation of created things,\nBy steps we may ascend to God.  But say,\nWhat meant that caution joined, If ye be found\nObedient?  Can we want obedience then\nTo him, or possibly his love desert,\nWho formed us from the dust and placed us here\nFull to the utmost measure of what bliss\nHuman desires can seek or apprehend?\nTo whom the Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth,\nAttend!  That thou art happy, owe to God;\nThat thou continuest such, owe to thyself,\nThat is, to thy obedience; therein stand.\nThis was that caution given thee; be advised.\nGod made thee perfect, not immutable;\nAnd good he made thee, but to persevere\nHe left it in thy power; ordained thy will\nBy nature free, not over-ruled by fate\nInextricable, or strict necessity:\nOur voluntary service he requires,\nNot our necessitated; such with him\nFinds no acceptance, nor can find; for how\nCan hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve\nWilling or no, who will but what they must\nBy destiny, and can no other choose?\nMyself, and all the angelick host, that stand\nIn sight of God, enthroned, our happy state\nHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;\nOn other surety none:  Freely we serve,\nBecause we freely love, as in our will\nTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:\nAnd some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,\nAnd so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall\nFrom what high state of bliss, into what woe!\nTo whom our great progenitor.  Thy words\nAttentive, and with more delighted ear,\nDivine instructer, I have heard, than when\nCherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills\nAereal musick send:  Nor knew I not\nTo be both will and deed created free;\nYet that we never shall forget to love\nOur Maker, and obey him whose command\nSingle is yet so just, my constant thoughts\nAssured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest\nHath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,\nBut more desire to hear, if thou consent,\nThe full relation, which must needs be strange,\nWorthy of sacred silence to be heard;\nAnd we have yet large day, for scarce the sun\nHath finished half his journey, and scarce begins\nHis other half in the great zone of Heaven.\nThus Adam made request; and Raphael,\nAfter short pause assenting, thus began.\nHigh matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,\nSad task and hard:  For how shall I relate\nTo human sense the invisible exploits\nOf warring Spirits? how, without remorse,\nThe ruin of so many glorious once\nAnd perfect while they stood? how last unfold\nThe secrets of another world, perhaps\nNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy good\nThis is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach\nOf human sense, I shall delineate so,\nBy likening spiritual to corporal forms,\nAs may express them best; though what if Earth\nBe but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein\nEach to other like, more than on earth is thought?\nAs yet this world was not, and Chaos wild\nReigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests\nUpon her center poised; when on a day\n(For time, though in eternity, applied\nTo motion, measures all things durable\nBy present, past, and future,) on such day\nAs Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host\nOf Angels by imperial summons called,\nInnumerable before the Almighty's throne\nForthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared\nUnder their Hierarchs in orders bright:\nTen thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,\nStandards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear\nStream in the air, and for distinction serve\nOf hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;\nOr in their glittering tissues bear imblazed\nHoly memorials, acts of zeal and love\nRecorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs\nOf circuit inexpressible they stood,\nOrb within orb, the Father Infinite,\nBy whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,\nAmidst as from a flaming mount, whose top\nBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.\nHear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nHear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.\nThis day I have begot whom I declare\nMy only Son, and on this holy hill\nHim have anointed, whom ye now behold\nAt my right hand; your head I him appoint;\nAnd by myself have sworn, to him shall bow\nAll knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:\nUnder his great vice-gerent reign abide\nUnited, as one individual soul,\nFor ever happy:  Him who disobeys,\nMe disobeys, breaks union, and that day,\nCast out from God and blessed vision, falls\nInto utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place\nOrdained without redemption, without end.\nSo spake the Omnipotent, and with his words\nAll seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.\nThat day, as other solemn days, they spent\nIn song and dance about the sacred hill;\nMystical dance, which yonder starry sphere\nOf planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels\nResembles nearest, mazes intricate,\nEccentrick, intervolved, yet regular\nThen most, when most irregular they seem;\nAnd in their motions harmony divine\nSo smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear\nListens delighted.  Evening now approached,\n(For we have also our evening and our morn,\nWe ours for change delectable, not need;)\nForthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn\nDesirous; all in circles as they stood,\nTables are set, and on a sudden piled\nWith Angels food, and rubied nectar flows\nIn pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,\nFruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.\nOn flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,\nThey eat, they drink, and in communion sweet\nQuaff immortality and joy, secure\nOf surfeit, where full measure only bounds\nExcess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered\nWith copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.\nNow when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled\nFrom that high mount of God, whence light and shade\nSpring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed\nTo grateful twilight, (for night comes not there\nIn darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed\nAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;\nWide over all the plain, and wider far\nThan all this globous earth in plain outspread,\n(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,\nDispersed in bands and files, their camp extend\nBy living streams among the trees of life,\nPavilions numberless, and sudden reared,\nCelestial tabernacles, where they slept\nFanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,\nMelodious hymns about the sovran throne\nAlternate all night long: but not so waked\nSatan; so call him now, his former name\nIs heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,\nIf not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,\nIn favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught\nWith envy against the Son of God, that day\nHonoured by his great Father, and proclaimed\nMessiah King anointed, could not bear\nThrough pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.\nDeep malice thence conceiving and disdain,\nSoon as midnight brought on the dusky hour\nFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved\nWith all his legions to dislodge, and leave\nUnworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,\nContemptuous; and his next subordinate\nAwakening, thus to him in secret spake.\nSleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close\nThy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree\nOf yesterday, so late hath passed the lips\nOf Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy thoughts\nWast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;\nBoth waking we were one; how then can now\nThy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed;\nNew laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise\nIn us who serve, new counsels to debate\nWhat doubtful may ensue:  More in this place\nTo utter is not safe.  Assemble thou\nOf all those myriads which we lead the chief;\nTell them, that by command, ere yet dim night\nHer shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,\nAnd all who under me their banners wave,\nHomeward, with flying march, where we possess\nThe quarters of the north; there to prepare\nFit entertainment to receive our King,\nThe great Messiah, and his new commands,\nWho speedily through all the hierarchies\nIntends to pass triumphant, and give laws.\nSo spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused\nBad influence into the unwary breast\nOf his associate:  He together calls,\nOr several one by one, the regent Powers,\nUnder him Regent; tells, as he was taught,\nThat the Most High commanding, now ere night,\nNow ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,\nThe great hierarchal standard was to move;\nTells the suggested cause, and casts between\nAmbiguous words and jealousies, to sound\nOr taint integrity:  But all obeyed\nThe wonted signal, and superiour voice\nOf their great Potentate; for great indeed\nHis name, and high was his degree in Heaven;\nHis countenance, as the morning-star that guides\nThe starry flock, allured them, and with lies\nDrew after him the third part of Heaven's host.\nMean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns\nAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,\nAnd from within the golden lamps that burn\nNightly before him, saw without their light\nRebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread\nAmong the sons of morn, what multitudes\nWere banded to oppose his high decree;\nAnd, smiling, to his only Son thus said.\nSon, thou in whom my glory I behold\nIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might,\nNearly it now concerns us to be sure\nOf our Omnipotence, and with what arms\nWe mean to hold what anciently we claim\nOf deity or empire:  Such a foe\nIs rising, who intends to erect his throne\nEqual to ours, throughout the spacious north;\nNor so content, hath in his thought to try\nIn battle, what our power is, or our right.\nLet us advise, and to this hazard draw\nWith speed what force is left, and all employ\nIn our defence; lest unawares we lose\nThis our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.\nTo whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,\nLightning divine, ineffable, serene,\nMade answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes\nJustly hast in derision, and, secure,\nLaughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,\nMatter to me of glory, whom their hate\nIllustrates, when they see all regal power\nGiven me to quell their pride, and in event\nKnow whether I be dextrous to subdue\nThy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.\nSo spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,\nFar was advanced on winged speed; an host\nInnumerable as the stars of night,\nOr stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun\nImpearls on every leaf and every flower.\nRegions they passed, the mighty regencies\nOf Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,\nIn their triple degrees; regions to which\nAll thy dominion, Adam, is no more\nThan what this garden is to all the earth,\nAnd all the sea, from one entire globose\nStretched into longitude; which having passed,\nAt length into the limits of the north\nThey came; and Satan to his royal seat\nHigh on a hill, far blazing, as a mount\nRaised on a mount, with pyramids and towers\nFrom diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;\nThe palace of great Lucifer, (so call\nThat structure in the dialect of men\nInterpreted,) which not long after, he\nAffecting all equality with God,\nIn imitation of that mount whereon\nMessiah was declared in sight of Heaven,\nThe Mountain of the Congregation called;\nFor thither he assembled all his train,\nPretending so commanded to consult\nAbout the great reception of their King,\nThither to come, and with calumnious art\nOf counterfeited truth thus held their ears.\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nIf these magnifick titles yet remain\nNot merely titular, since by decree\nAnother now hath to himself engrossed\nAll power, and us eclipsed under the name\nOf King anointed, for whom all this haste\nOf midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,\nThis only to consult how we may best,\nWith what may be devised of honours new,\nReceive him coming to receive from us\nKnee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!\nToo much to one! but double how endured,\nTo one, and to his image now proclaimed?\nBut what if better counsels might erect\nOur minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?\nWill ye submit your necks, and choose to bend\nThe supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust\nTo know ye right, or if ye know yourselves\nNatives and sons of Heaven possessed before\nBy none; and if not equal all, yet free,\nEqually free; for orders and degrees\nJar not with liberty, but well consist.\nWho can in reason then, or right, assume\nMonarchy over such as live by right\nHis equals, if in power and splendour less,\nIn freedom equal? or can introduce\nLaw and edict on us, who without law\nErr not? much less for this to be our Lord,\nAnd look for adoration, to the abuse\nOf those imperial titles, which assert\nOur being ordained to govern, not to serve.\nThus far his bold discourse without controul\nHad audience; when among the Seraphim\nAbdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored\nThe Deity, and divine commands obeyed,\nStood up, and in a flame of zeal severe\nThe current of his fury thus opposed.\nO argument blasphemous, false, and proud!\nWords which no ear ever to hear in Heaven\nExpected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate,\nIn place thyself so high above thy peers.\nCanst thou with impious obloquy condemn\nThe just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,\nThat to his only Son, by right endued\nWith regal scepter, every soul in Heaven\nShall bend the knee, and in that honour due\nConfess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,\nFlatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,\nAnd equal over equals to let reign,\nOne over all with unsucceeded power.\nShalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute\nWith him the points of liberty, who made\nThee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven\nSuch as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?\nYet, by experience taught, we know how good,\nAnd of our good and of our dignity\nHow provident he is; how far from thought\nTo make us less, bent rather to exalt\nOur happy state, under one head more near\nUnited.  But to grant it thee unjust,\nThat equal over equals monarch reign:\nThyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,\nOr all angelick nature joined in one,\nEqual to him begotten Son? by whom,\nAs by his Word, the Mighty Father made\nAll things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven\nBy him created in their bright degrees,\nCrowned them with glory, and to their glory named\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,\nEssential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,\nBut more illustrious made; since he the head\nOne of our number thus reduced becomes;\nHis laws our laws; all honour to him done\nReturns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,\nAnd tempt not these; but hasten to appease\nThe incensed Father, and the incensed Son,\nWhile pardon may be found in time besought.\nSo spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal\nNone seconded, as out of season judged,\nOr singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced\nThe Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.\nThat we were formed then sayest thou? and the work\nOf secondary hands, by task transferred\nFrom Father to his Son? strange point and new!\nDoctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw\nWhen this creation was? rememberest thou\nThy making, while the Maker gave thee being?\nWe know no time when we were not as now;\nKnow none before us, self-begot, self-raised\nBy our own quickening power, when fatal course\nHad circled his full orb, the birth mature\nOf this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.\nOur puissance is our own; our own right hand\nShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try\nWho is our equal:  Then thou shalt behold\nWhether by supplication we intend\nAddress, and to begirt the almighty throne\nBeseeching or besieging.  This report,\nThese tidings carry to the anointed King;\nAnd fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.\nHe said; and, as the sound of waters deep,\nHoarse murmur echoed to his words applause\nThrough the infinite host; nor less for that\nThe flaming Seraph fearless, though alone\nEncompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.\nO alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,\nForsaken of all good!  I see thy fall\nDetermined, and thy hapless crew involved\nIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spread\nBoth of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth\nNo more be troubled how to quit the yoke\nOf God's Messiah; those indulgent laws\nWill not be now vouchsafed; other decrees\nAgainst thee are gone forth without recall;\nThat golden scepter, which thou didst reject,\nIs now an iron rod to bruise and break\nThy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise;\nYet not for thy advice or threats I fly\nThese wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath\nImpendent, raging into sudden flame,\nDistinguish not:  For soon expect to feel\nHis thunder on thy head, devouring fire.\nThen who created thee lamenting learn,\nWhen who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.\nSo spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found\nAmong the faithless, faithful only he;\nAmong innumerable false, unmoved,\nUnshaken, unseduced, unterrified,\nHis loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;\nNor number, nor example, with him wrought\nTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,\nThough single.  From amidst them forth he passed,\nLong way through hostile scorn, which he sustained\nSuperiour, nor of violence feared aught;\nAnd, with retorted scorn, his back he turned\nOn those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.",

In a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat butter, oil, and both sugars until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla until it is combined. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Mix to combine. Gently stir in the peeled, shredded apples. Generously grease and flour a standard size bundt cake pan. Transfer the batter to the bundt pan and use a spatula to gently even out the top. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes before flipping the cake to remove the cake from the pan. Completely cool the cake on a wire rack. You can freeze the cake before icing by wrapping the cooled cake tightly in plastic wrap. For the maple glaze: Sift the icing sugar into a small bowl. This will prevent any lumps in your icing. Add the milk and maple extract. Mix well to combine. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake.",

In a microwave-safe bowl, combine butter, milk and water. Heat for 2 minutes. Test with your finger; if the mixture is too hot to the touch, it will be too hot for your yeast. Add liquid ingredients to the dry mixture. Mix. Now add the eggs and mix well. Add 6 cups of flour. This will give you a very sticky dough. Add 2 1/2 cups of flour and knead in. Knead for 5 minutes. Your dough will be still be a little sticky. Add the oil to a bowl and roll your dough in it. Let rise for 2 hours, punch down and rise for another hour. For the filling: Divide your dough in half. Take one half and split it into 3 sections. You will need to roll this out in a long oval. Spread a little melted butter across the dough. You do not want too much or it will make your dough very soggy. Mix cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg together. Now sprinkle your mixture of sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg over the dough. (Don't use too much. This mixture will make two whole braids or 6 rolled out sections.) Once you have done this, roll up the dough. Now do this two more times. Once you have 3 pieces done, braid them together. Do the other half to the dough the same way. Tuck the ends under and let rise for 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees for 28 to 30 minutes. This recipe makes two braids! For the glaze: Mix the melted butter, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla together. Take a spoon and drizzle over a cooled braid. Top with pecans and 3 cherries. Serve with coffee, milk or orange juice on Christmas morning. This is AMAZING!",
    "1 1/2 Tbl. grated ginger\n1 lemon\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 teaspoon yeast\ncool water\nclean 2-liter bottle or growler jug\n1. Juice the lemon and set it aside.  2. Pour the sugar into the bottle.  4. Pour the yeast into the bottle. Shake the bottle so that the yeast and sugar are mixed well.  5. Pour the ginger and the lemon juice into the bottle.  6. Fill the bottle about one-quarter full of cold water and shake well again, so that everything's mixed well and the sugar and yeast are dissolved.  7. Fill up the bottle with water until nearly but not quite full, leaving an inch or two of space from the lid.  8. Leave out the bottle in a warm spot for 2-3 days, or until it's carbonated to the degree you want. Then chill the ginger ale in the fridge and enjoy. (You'll probably want to filter the ginger ale as you pour it into the glass. Otherwise you'll get little bits of grated ginger stuck on your lips.)  Warning: If you leave the bottle too long in the warmth, you risk the bottle exploding.  Feel free to fiddle around with the amounts of ginger, lemon or sugar, as you like. Personally, I've found that 1 cup of sugar seems the perfect amount, for me, at least. Even a scant bit less makes the soda bland; a little bit more gets syrupy sweet.",
    "3 cups all-purpose flour\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n1 3/4 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n1 large egg\n6 tablespoons ice water\n1. Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and mix together with your fingertips or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. 2. Mix the egg with the water in a small bowl. Toss the mixture gently with the butter mixture until the dough comes together; do not overwork it. Divide the dough in half. Flatten each half with the palm of your hand to form a thick disk. Wrap both disks in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. 3. Remove 1 disk of dough from the refrigerator. Unwrap it and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface or between 2 sheets of wax paper to form a circle about 1/8-inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pie plate. Work quickly, as the dough can become sticky. 4. Use a spatula to help lift the dough and fold it loosely in half, then in quarters. Gently transfer the dough to the pie plate, placing the corner of the dough in the center of the plate. Open up the dough and press it lightly into the plate to fit. (If the dough should tear, just press it gently together.) Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. 5. Repeat the rolling process with the second disk of dough to make the top crust. The circle of the top crust should be 10 inches in diameter.",
    "1 chicken carcass or leftover bones from several legs, wings etc.\n1 stalk celery\n1 onion\n1 carrot\n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed (optional)\n3-4 cloves garlic, crushed (optional)\n1 bunch fresh thyme or 2-3 tsp dry\nPut everything in a big pot. Pour in enough water to cover the bones and veggies. Bring to a boil then turn to low heat. Skim off any foamy stuff that comes to the top of the broth. Simmer for about 3 hours (split up the time throughout the day if necessary - if you can watch the stove so long). Check periodically to stir up a little and add more water if it has evaporated too much (keep it at the level you started). After cooking, remove all the big pieces of chicken bones and vegetables with tongs or a spoon. There's no more flavor left in the vegetables or meat, so you can discard. The broth should look golden and delicious :) Let cool then strain out the broth to get rid of any small pieces of veggies, etc. and put in a big tupperware, or jar. If freezing, store in a freezer safe container or zip-lock bags after cooling. One easy way to use the fresh broth right away is to make a vegetable soup! Cut up your favorite veggies into small pieces (I used onion, celery, carrots, potatoes and cauliflower). Saute the veggies in a little olive oil, then pour in some broth to cover. Cook until vegetables are tender. This is also great to add noodles (and leftover chicken) too for chicken noodle soup!",

Add the salt and sugar and cook until dissolved. Add the fennel seeds, garlic, thyme and fennel fronds and remove from the heat. Let cool completely (or reduce the amount of water in the brine by 2 cups and add 4 cups ice cubes to cool down immediately). Transfer the brine to a plastic container, add the pork, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. For the smoked pork: Remove the pork from the brine, rinse well with cold water and pat dry. Put on a rack set over a baking sheet and refrigerate (to allow a crust, or skin, to form on the outside) for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours. Remove the grill grate and ceramic plate from the cooker. Add the hot hardwood charcoal and scatter the soaked wood chips over the top. Put on the ceramic plate and the grill rack, close the cover, bring the temperature to between 300 and 325 degrees F and allow to smoke for 10 minutes. Brush the entire loin with oil and sprinkle with pepper. Place on the rack, close the cover and smoke at 140 degrees F until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers, 1 to 1 hour 30 minutes. While the pork smokes, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey. Start brushing it on the pork about 30 minutes before it is done. When done, remove, loosely tent and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. For the fennel gremolata: Cut the fennel into small dice and coarsely chop the fronds; put in a bowl. Add the zest and juice and drizzle with a little olive oil; mix to combine. Let sit at room temperature.

Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy and begins to smell of yeast. Add the flour and butter to the yeast mixture. Attach the dough hook to the stand mixer and, on medium-low speed, combine the mixture until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and appears shiny, roughly 4 to 5 minutes. Spray a large bowl with non-stick spray (or lightly grease with vegetable oil) and place dough in greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Place bowl in a warm area and let dough rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Place an oven rack in the top third of your oven, and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Spray parchment paper with non-stick spray. Set aside. In a large pot, bring the 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a rolling boil. Place the dough on a greased surface, and divide into 16 equal pieces (If you weigh dough, like I do, they will be about 2.20 oz. each). Roll each piece into a long rope, roughly 12 inches long. Carefully wrap half of each piece around a third of a hot dog. Pinch the ends together to seal the dough. If you run out of hot dogs before dough, make regular pretzels. Cut a little more dough off (3 oz.), and shape as desired. Place each shaped pretzel on the parchment lined baking sheet. Boil the shaped pretzels and pretzel dogs, one at a time, in the baking soda water for 30 seconds each. Using a slotted spatula or spider strainer, remove each pretzel dog from the water and place it on a drying rack to allow any extra baking soda mixture to drip off. Place the boiled pretzel dogs back on the parchment lined baking sheets. Brush with beaten egg yolk and sprinkle with pretzel or kosher salt. Bake until golden brown, roughly 10 1/2 minutes (14 to 15 minutes for large pretzels). Transfer pretzel dogs to a cooling rack for a few minutes before serving. Serve with a variety of mustards or cheese sauce.",

    "2 poblano/pasilla peppers\n1 onion, chopped\n3 fresh corn, kernels cut off\n1/2 cup chicken/veggie broth or water\nsplash cream/whole milk\n1/4 pound queso fresco, cubed\nChar the peppers. Poblano pepper skins have a slightly bitter taste so you need to get it off. In order to do this you have 2 options. If you have a gas stove that produces a flame, char the peppers over the flame until the skin is black and blistered over the whole pepper. I have an electric stove so what I do is set the oven to broil and move one of the racks up to the very top. Broil the peppers, rotating as soon as the skin by the broiler is black, until it's charred on all sides. Put the charred peppers in a plastic bag or in a bowl covered in plastic as soon as they're done being charred to steam it so the skin peels off easily. Peel the peppers. Some peppers are a little spicy so wearing gloves could be useful. Peel all the skin off the peppers. Then remove the stem, seeds and veins. Slice into strips. Heat some olive or vegetable oil over medium heat in a pan big enough to hold all the corn and peppers. Saute the onion until clear and fragrant. Add the corn kernels, peppers and broth. Simmer covered for about 15 minutes. Add the splash of cream and remove from heat. Stir in cheese and enjoy.",

Add the sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, orange zest and cloves and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for about an hour. In the meantime, make the chocolate sauce. Combine the chocolate and cream in a small saucepan and set over low heat. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is just melted, and then remove from the heat and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the vanilla, cinnamon and cayenne pepper. If necessary, whisk in a little bit of water to loosen the sauce. Set aside in a warm place. Pour about an inch of oil into a wide, shallow saucepan and set over medium-high heat. When a small piece of batter sizzles after you drop it into the oil, you are ready to fry. Drop rounded teaspoons of the batter into the oil in small batches and fry for about 2 minutes on each side, turning once, until golden brown. Drain the fritters on paper towels, dust with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately with the chocolate sauce (if it has thickened too much, you may need to reheat the sauce gently, whisking constantly, and add a bit more water).",
    "2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter\n1 1/4 cups superfine sugar\n4 cups all-purpose flour\nBlanched almonds or pistachio nuts to decorate\nCream the butter and beat it until it becomes white. Add the sugar, beating constantly for about 5 minutes, until it is a smooth cream. Add flour gradually, working it in by hand. Although no liquid is added, this makes a very soft dough. If the dough is too soft, add a little more flour. Take walnut-sized lumps, roll them into balls, and flatten them slightly. Place them on a baking sheet a little apart from each other, as they spread slightly. Stick a blanched almond or pistachio on top of each one. Bake in a 325F oven for 2030 minutes. Do not let the ghorayebah overcook. They must remain very white: they taste quite different if they are even slightly brown. Let them cool before you try to move them. An exquisite variation is to replace 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup ground hazelnuts. You can flavor the dough with a grating of nutmeg, or 12 teaspoons of cinnamon or ground cardamom. Another traditional shape for ghorayebah is little bracelets. Roll the dough into 4-inch-long sausage shapes about 1/2 inch thick, and bring the ends together to make bracelets. Decorate with split almonds or pistachios.",

But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

Dust mites are something I’ve always suspected but was not officially diagnosed with it until I took the test. Growing up, I’ve always had cold urticaria but that seem to have disappeared only to be replaced with sun sensitivity. And there’s so little known about PMLE like I just wanna know what’s going on with my body. I feel so helpless. I just wanna be out and sunbathe and not to be so itchy the next day.",
    "Me and my wife moved to Alabama to take care of my grandparents, my grandfather has dementia and my grandma, Well she just has a bad habit of not doing stuff and just praying everything will work out. They moved to Alabama to our current house to live with my great uncle. He passed away without an updated will while verbally he said the house was going to my grandparents his will was made in the 1990s. We got the house probated and my grandpa ended up being the owner of the estate. My grandma told me that they had it put in their name and that they were going to make a will. After my grandpa passed away I found out that they neither put the house in their name nor did they make a will. Dose my grandma inherit the estate of my great uncle? Or are we going to have to probate the house again?",
    "Kind of following up on my earlier post. I've managed to get Mech Assault's .xiso extracted and onto my console's hdd via ftp networking but it won't boot. Am I missing something? When I try to rip it with dvd2xbox, it says it failed to get like 5 out of 90 files. I've tried ripping it twice with the same results. I don't want to keep trying to rip it or play it off the disc and contribute to burning out my disc drive. Not sure why the install isn't working. Anything obvious I'm missing? I was also wondering if anyone has actually played Mech Assault on a modded og xbox. Maybe there's just a compatibility issue with Evo x and the game. The game boots up and plays just fine if I do try to play it off the disc and it doesn't look damaged so I don't think it's a problem with the disc",
    "Missing 411 cases fascinate me in part because they really come closest to feeling like the closest real-life analogue to a Cthulhu-esque horror. In the Cthulhu books, these types of beings were portrayed as completely alien and unfathomable, like there is no way to understand their intentions or desires, they are just on another level entirely. They are also irresistibly powerful, mere humans have no hope of overpowering them or defeating them. In Missing 411 cases, we have no idea why this is done to people and what they get out of it, but there is a clear intelligence to which victims are taken, when they are taken, and how they are taken. Also, the entity responsible seems to have no constraints, taking people even from crowded areas and always being able to avoid being witnessed by other people or even security cameras. The implications of this phenomena are utterly terrifying and fascinating.",

    "Hi everyone, I’ve been selling for just over a year, launched 3 relatively successful products, and recently launched a fourth in the health and beauty category which has been a complete disappointment. I felt I had done my research, had invested in great photos and spent time making a keyword rich listing, but found the lower price point to be far lower than I expected to get even one or two sales. Long term I am struggling to see how I can make profit margins when I include PPC/VAT. Seems like there is now an ongoing price war in the niche and I can’t see anyone making money. I can always try to drive external traffic sources, improve the listing and drive more reviews, but when do you decide it’s not worth the investment with this ASIN and move on? A lot of gurus online talk about their biggest “failures”, but I had always felt there was a solution to most challenges that can be overcome by improvements to the listing or advertising approach before giving up. At what point do people pull out of a product line and decide this is a “failure” and not worth further investment?",
    "I’ve been talking to this girl for a while now and even though she tells me that she feels comfortable with me, it doesn’t feel like she is. She doesn’t send many pictures of herself even though I do and I also tell her she’s very pretty when she sends a picture or when she turns her camera on when we call. But she just doesn’t seem very comfortable with showing her face a lot. Also sometimes I feel like maybe I’m too clingy and I just want to be talking to her all the time and maybe that makes her uncomfortable. I’m also very open about how I feel about us and how I hope that in the future we can be together and even though she has told me that she wants to be with me too, sometimes it doesn’t feel like it. I don’t know maybe I’m just overthinking the whole thing and she does want to be with me but she’s just not as open about her feelings as I am.",
    "I'm slowly starting back up in the dating pool after a long term relationship and I think that probably the worst part about it is I relocated due to my job, and the city I'm in is considered one of the worst in the US for trying to find a relationship. So many reports of how the hookup culture hears vastly outweighs the dating culture. Definitely made me a bit worried, but maybe I'll get lucky. Also, aside from how bad dating apps have gotten from all of the extra features that help less and the addition of triple the pay walls for some apps, is it just me or has the landscape gotten more kinky? I mean, I look around and there are so many who mention that they have a kink. It definitely makes me a proven vanilla that much harder to find someone out there, and I'm already looking in a smaller pool of potential dates since I would love someone on the more nerdy/geeky side",
    "I think the title is self explanatory. It’s true. When I have a crush I hate myself for having a crush on them. Because I know that I can’t do anything about it. And although I would like to confess I’m actually scared of them saying yes. Weird right? I mean I’m supposed to happy if my crush says yes to goin g out with me but for me it’s the opposite. Because I know that when we’re together all I’m going to think about is when we break up. Where I’m going to break up with them. What the reason should be for me breaking up with them. And how I should break up with them. And that feeling makes me feel so guilty because this precious person is giving me their all and here I am being a half-assed person. But I can’t help myself from having a crush, it just happens. I feel sorry for whoever I come to like and come to date. I feel like I’m going to be lonely until the end of time.",
    "So I spent a day with my boy bestfriend and we went out and got food and spoke and we just had fun. Later when we were at his house he was being really comfortable and he cuddled me and was being different. I felt bad for liking it and wanting to take it further. It felt wrong to be like that with him so I broke up with my boyfriend. But that wasn't the only reason I broke up with him, I realized I didn't want to kiss him or anything anymore and I feel like I subconsciously moved him back to \"friend\" in my mind. And I'm 17 and realized I didn't really want such a serious relationship right now, or a relationship at all rn. So after that my boy bestfriend made a move and now he wants a relationship but I don't, but I liked it when he kissed me. So I don't know what to do",
    "I believe that the tech market will be down on Monday. The report was quite positive, smashing expectations for new jobs. There is other stuff. But I see value stocks back in play for Monday. Rotation out of tech for a day or two, and then back into tech for April. The fact that the report was positive sounds positive overall, but more jobs means more workers, and more people being out and about and spending on basic necessities that they needed. I can’t imagine this translating to more spending on tech stocks. I think there’s still value in some tech stocks, which is why I say April will be green overall, but I’m talking Monday open after Easter. Historically seems to be more favored to a down day also. Thoughts?",
    "My mom notably would always say she was gonna “drive away from the house” and leave, and stuff similar to that. My parents would always fight and actually get in legitimate fights with each other and I remember once when I was younger, they made me pick between which parent I wanted to stay with because I thought they were moving away from each other. I used to look back on this stuff and not think it was horrible, I don’t even know if I think it’s horrible now because I’m used to it. I remember once my dad would chase me with his belt around a table, I don’t know why he did this but he did, I must’ve done something to deserve it.. I remember being beaten/hit by both of them for reasons i don’t even know. i think being afraid of saying something wrong and having my stuff taken away from me as a consequence transferred over to me being this antisocial person that has trouble talking and being vulnerable with people.. anyway enough rambling, does that stuff cause abandonment issues/other things?",
    "For those freaking out about the price differences, think of it in comparison to the credit bureaus. Your credit scores are not the same across the board. Each bureau has a different way of calculating your score, and some have different information. But eventually, it all all even up and be closer to one another. If you are already getting restless and impatient, maybe you shouldn’t be investing in crypto or stocks for that matter. Everyone needs to take a chill, sit back and enjoy the ride. Buy the dips if you want to get more, but hold on to your coins and let the system do the work for you. If you are super worried about losing money, just pull out your initial investment once you make money, and let your profit do the work. But you’re gonna regret it when it takes off and you sold potential millions.",
    "Brief as backstory. My mother is emotionally damaged, severely, not her fault, but resulted in an upbringing where by the age of 9 I was taken to a lot of psychologists to find out “ what was wrong with me”. I left home when I was 14, stayed an aunt until I was 17, moved out and made my own life. Fast forward 13 years, I have a degree, job, house, kids everything I wanted, 2 weeks ago my mum was supposed to be attending a family event but decided not to go, but wanted to come and visit my kids and stay at our house. It’s been 1.5 years since we saw her last so I said yes. She came, was her typical self, this time I felt sorry for her as supposed to getting angry at her for her behaviours - she’ll tell my daughter they’ll go do something then say no she’s too tired. Anyway, since she’s left, I cannot shake the feeling of how I used to feel when I was 14. Things were never good enough, I wasn’t going to go far in life, my achievements aren’t really achievements. Then she texts and asks about only ONE of her grandchildren, typical her behaviour. I’ve talked to my husband about it, I’ve trained hard at the gym gone for extra runs. I’m short with my own kids which isn’t usual for me, I cannot fathom why she is doing the exact same thing she did to me and my brothers now she’s trying to divide my kids, she knew exactly what she was doing, she’s horrible - asked multiple times when my second child’s birthday was. I can’t seem to calm down from this, like I say, I’ve reverted right back to 14 and all those feels associated with that and it sucks.",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "This is like day 5 and i woke up this morning with like no withdrawal symptoms and no cravings. I basically just took supplements, drank a lot of water and coffee, and smoked weed at night. Honestly i think the supplements are what helped the most I strongly encourage who ever is quitting to take ashwagandha, Htp-5, and Rhodiola Rosea Extract two of each twice a day. Its been giving me the biggest boosts of serotonin and as i did feel the withdrawal symptoms this dramatically reduced them. I’m telling you if you are struggling take these and you will feel soo much better. And also smoke weed or take CBD if you like, it kinda takes the edge off. But i like these supplements so much I’ll probably take them for a long time",
    "I use syncthing on my Android phone and my PC to sync photos and ebooks etc. I thought it might be a good idea to tell my client to then only sync when I'm on my home network to save a bit of battery when I'm out and about and need it more. I don't really need it to sync to my PC while I'm out anyway, I can wait for it to do so automatically when i get home. I enabled location permissions and got it working, but was bummed to find that out requires location to be on to figure out what network I'm connected to. I never turn my location on at home because I don't need to use GPS to find my way around my house, 😆. Seems a really weird and silly way for this to work. Why can't it tell what SSID I'm on and figure without turning on my GPS. Are there any good workarounds besides leaving sync on all the time or turning location on when I'm at home?",
    "I have been taking klonopijn daily for around 5 years now. Recently since the pandemic started and my life started to fall apart before my eyes, I was upped in my dosage. Then I was upped again, and again, and again. Now I am at the point of taking 6mg-8mg/day. It has gotten completely out of control and made my situation from covid even worse and less manageable. and I almost have no tolerance. I want to start a taper, not an aggressive one, that will help bring me back down to at least 1mg/day. Could this be done in a couple of months? If so does anyone have good taper recommendations. Furthermore, considering the stress will feel at times almost unbearable, does anyone know of any good anti stress replacements or anything that can be taken during this process?",
    "Argus new changes in the advanced server is really bad. This is due to his base Physical Atk and growth being nerfed significantly. Furthermore we got a stun duration nerf for a range buff, but a range buff wasn’t needed yet that stun duration is crucial and the reason why i would even call it argus best skill.  all of this huge nerfs just for passive being 320% yet this depends on his physical atk so the nerfs actually nerfs this buff as well. So in conclusion. This changes overall nerfs argus. Current live argus is great tbh. a small buff instead to like 280% is suffice or just the quality of life like the animation stop i would say instead of basically nerfing him more in terms of dmg cause -75 is A LOT",

    "Every so often I have troubles getting an erection. I’m a 24yo male and shouldn’t have this issue. With my ex it was like a gust of wind could get it up. Now not so much. And as this happens every so often it affects my perspective of my feelings for her. It makes me question if I love her or not or if it’s my body telling me I am not attracted when I don’t actually feel that way. It’s depressing and I am on lexapro and know that can be a factor but am I crazy for thinking this . Is it just a snowball effect because of that? Is this a normal occurrence for people sometimes.

I've known what it's like to be in the darkest place in the world, and I really don't want to go back. Today, I had a lot of fun going out with a friend to watch Godzilla vs Kong and walk around town for a bit. At the end of the day, I came back home and just realized \"Man, everything is so damn awful when we aren't hanging out\". That led to a lot more thinking about how much I'm fucking up my life by failing tons of my classes, how much time I spend sitting here being a worthless person, and how I'm such a burden on everyone. Literally nothing seems fun unless I'm around them, and I think it's sad that, even though I have blood relatives, the only person I consider to be family is him. I guess I don't want to be loved, I want to feel loved. I really hope this is just an episode and not something worse. Sorry for the rant, but hey, I didn't make you read this.",

Couldn’t possibly imagine being prepared for a ton of people trying to play and having your server situation figured out beforehand so you don’t look as incompetent as every other crap gaming company in existence today.

    "Hey y’all, struggling Christian here with a question. When I pray alone I feel like I’m talking to myself. It feels weird because prayer is kind of like a letter to god so it shouldn’t feel like a conversation. But then I started think that all of the good feelings I get come from within me like happiness, joy, or excitement. Those are all internal feeing that can show through my expressions and words but at their core they are from my brain. And I used to think I needed to thank God for those feelings because he was the one that put them there. But now I feel like those good feelings I get are just a reaction based on what’s happening around me and to me. So my questions is: is it possible gods love comes from ourselves rather then from him? And if so why would I need God anymore?",

I also live with my fiancé and so when they interviewed me she asked all about him as well since we live in the same household. I figured we wouldn't receive any benefits because he made okay money then and was not laid off. At the time of the interview I did verbally tell my caseworker that he was not working at that moment only due to complications with covid shut down everything. She still had me send over his last 2 check stubs and then we ended up getting approved. I was shocked but excited. Cut to now.

One thing I’ve learned about is how much I dissociate and how this has been a defense mechanism since was a kid.  She has been gently letting me know that I may have some degree of DID or dissociative identity disorder.  This was pretty scary at first but I’m thinking that she may be on to something.  I don’t have multiple identities on the outside that anyone would notice, but it’s clear that my childhood trauma caused me to have splintered off parts of self that have never been integrated.  Those parts of self are in regular conflict with each other and the result is anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.

I think short sides and longer hair on top is so attractive and I want to look like that but I’m always worried I couldn’t pull it off.

Something along the lines of \"this type of trap has active and dynamic effects, and different aspects of it may have countermeasures\", kind of thing?  Or should I leave it to them to figure out.  I don't want to hand hold too much, but it also kind of sucks to be taking part in a 'mini-game' and not even know its happening.

I have also in recent years educated myself on basic programming so I also have an interest in how the stock market is run by computer. The program/s that run it is no doubt a monster. So, that leads me to a question. What is the likely hood that a stock can be 'throttled' so it doesn't rise as it should? The calculations tweaked so it is less responsive to growth. Assuming the rise of a stock is a linear rise, what if they set it so that it is a non-linear rise, finally topping out at a pre-specified amount? Who runs the software and servers that handle all of this? Is there a company that does it? The government? I've never heard anything on this subject, ever.",

My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

And on the internet I thought I had a chance to feel more comfortable, and act freely to be myself.

I try to be outgoing and social, but when people tell me Im being annoying it makes me feel stupid. And sometimes I tell myself, “be yourself”.

We broke up about 6 years ago. And while she moved on after couple of months Ive not been able to do the same thing even after 6 years. Not a day goes by when I don’t think about her. We haven’t talked since several years and i don’t want to disturb her life now. Every-time I initiate dating someone all i see is her face what would be her reaction on that joke or how would she react. She has a boyfriend now. While I’m still miserable. Trust me Ive tried moving on. Tried online dating. Tried everything. But she just cant go away from my mind. Her memories have become a painful comfort. Why do you think this is happening and what should I do to get over her? Ive tried therapy Ive tried burning mementos. But she is tattooed inside my mind.",
    "Covid is a contagious and deadly virus, no matter what people have read on their shady \"news\" sites or watched in YouTube videos. Actual experts and their advice exist. However, as a therapist, I am expected to validate thoughts and resulting ignorant actions as though it could be truth. I'm tired of it. Adults have a responsibility to educate themselves and recognize propaganda. In this case, the ignorance is killing people. Yet, I have to look them in the eye and pretend to understand their views so that I don't cause THEM more psychological harm as they breathe freely in my space without masks during a deadly pandemic. I don't love shaming people but if anyone should be, it is them. People I know have suffered. Some have died. But I can't, because somehow it is just expected that I'll put my health at risk daily, and not doing so could cost me my job, license, etc. I'm just over it, and over these ignorant folks.",
    "Hi. I want help if anyone can spare a few words of encouragement. I wrote religious on the topic of this because I am kind of a religious. I grew up catholic and I don’t follow the church a lot but I do have faith. I’ve posted her before about how my dad treats me. I’m the oldest daughter and I feel like my mom and I are used as the scapegoat to why everything is horrible for my dad. Anyway, I feel alone a lot. I pray and I feel like no one is listening. Does anyone have some scripture or words of encouragement from the Bible? I sometimes feel like I am the one in the wrong because my dad uses God and my faith against me. Anything would be great. I am going to get a keepsake with the Virgin Mary on it to keep me safe and to remind myself she is there with me. Anyway, thank you to this group. It makes me feel less alone.",
    "I’m a 23 y/o female, 5’2”, and currently weigh 141lbs. I work out 3-4 times a week and am on my feet constantly at work. I’d say I eat an overall healthy diet, cook majority of the time at home, and would describe  myself as moderately active. My concern is over the past year I have gained 10lbs and not changed any of these practices. I’ve been told the weight could be muscles or due to recently returning to school and undergoing stress but I find myself ashamed and unmotivated to continue working out and pushing myself harder. I love weights and cardio but have been finding it hard to motivate myself when I see the number on the scale going up. Am I just psyching myself out or do I need to revisit my overall health routine?",
    "My grandma passed away when I was 8 years old, over 25 years ago. She and my mom were very close; they talked almost every day and were like best friends. After she passed away it was like a light went out in my mom. Every occasion, happy or sad, has had a dark cloud over it because my grandma wasn't there. I miss my grandma too, but it makes me so sad to feel like I will never see my mom truly happy again. She is now the same age that my grandma was when she died, so all the grief is coming out even more. I am the main person she comes to for support and I don't know how to handle it. She calls me crying and says things like, \"I'm just so sad. My life would be so much better if she was still alive.\" I feel like I need to be the \"parent\" and support my mom because she is always so sad all the time.  I was wondering if anyone else was in a similar situation or had any words of advice or wisdom. Thank you.",
    "I had a dream when I was sitting on my couch at night with a girl I didn’t recognize. Although I didn’t recognize her she felt so familiar and it felt like I knew every thing about her. Her brother walked in through the front door and said something that frustrated her. I put my arm around her and then realized that I don’t know her, but she looked at me and put my hand back around her. We fell asleep like that and when I woke up she was gone. I went into my room and there were all these clues left around pointing to seemingly nothing. The only one I can remember is that there was an extra sticker near a power outlet that was a brand which I didn’t use. I recognized this bc I had always used a rival brand. All I can say is that the rest of the dream was me trying to find her and I never did. This last part was very vague.",

    "As a young person and recent defector of the Liberal/Democrat ideology, I have been thinking about the state of our culture and time here in America. Every day I feel myself compelled to stand up and speak in an act of revolution against the status quo. I feel as if God is telling me to follow my heart and speak the truth as an artist against the untruth. But fear is prevalent. Most art, film, music, writing are dominated by ideologically liberal leaning people. Websites where artists gather to advertise their work like YouTube and Facebook are censoring and banning voices that have Conservative values and ideas. How far can I get as an artist down this path? I feel like a bird being forced to crawl on the ground feeling so desperate and hopeless wanting to use the gift and passion my God has given me. In this time when the voice of a conservative is a revolutionary act, are there enough minds out there that would support or be interested in conservative art? I want myself to be economically stable enough to support myself, my future wife, and children. Or should I find another passion?",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

But it doesn’t end there, ladies and gentlemen, I respond with “hitler was a nazi”. He says that anyone who apposes the left is a nazi so that makes him the same as a republican. I said that not everyone who apposes him is a nazi, and he replied with “that’s why we need to imprison everyone who disagrees with the left first because they are the violent ones who want to kill us.” What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People? Better watch out, this guy is gonna run for president and imprison every “nazi” so that it is only pure people with his beliefs.

    "So, I’m currently trying to teach myself astrology. I find that looking at each thing in my chart helps with understanding parts of it. Like for example, my Mars in Libra is what helps me approach things more calmly and my Mercury in Capricorn helps me to formulate my sentences before saying them. But what I have trouble with is putting everything together. I’ve been reading up on aspects and patterns as well, but I just get so confused. It’s like I have the puzzle pieces but I don’t know how to put them together. So I was wondering how everyone here got the hang of reading charts as a whole instead of just their parts?

Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",
    "With such an epic story, you would think someone like Stone would produce an epic film. From the random accents of the characters (specifically, I have no idea what Jolie was trying to do), to some pretty atrocious acting from Farrell-he's capable of much better, but this was at the height of his grandiosity and ego. There are so many moments where it feels like the film is onto something, only to have it stop and spin off into another, pointless direction. Bottom line: a $155 mil film about Alexander the Great should have been iconic, but Alexander falls flat on its face from the weight of the egos involved.",
    "The film is dark humoured, satiric and mocking mirror of society reflecting on human's obsession to fit in certain rules of society, despite how ridiculous they are. We step on our primary feelings and ignore our instincts just to play by the rules, to belong. And even it was the clear theme of being obsessed with being in a couple, I see it as a bigger reflection of society. After the main character runs into the woods, where he finds rebels of coupling, it's clear that they are as extreme as the hotel people. It looks like it's shown that people have to belong to survive, but options are limited and you have to obey, pretend or risk to be destroyed. Various examples of dysfunctional relationships are shown in the film, which looks so familiar – pretending to have something in common, pretending that you understand that you are the same. Desperation, rejection, cruelty in the relationships – we have seen and know it all, but director found the way to remind it with a lighter tone, with the possibility to laugh at ourselves and society. All the characters acted and talked in the same hyper-polite manner – that's what we do, so often we dance around difficult and extreme situations with our repressed feelings. And despite how similar everyone talked, with the same tone and politeness, we can see through that and find individuality of the characters, and it shows that we are more than just rules, etiquette  The obsession to have something in common with you partner reached the peek at the end. It looked like even David and blind women are still in love, but a realisation that in society norms they don't have anything real in common drives to an extreme decision. It shows that we sacrifice so much if we love someone different, and all just to be more acceptable in the society, but at the end society doesn't care, so do we just have to be braver? This film makes more think than feel. The audience who is used to relate to the characters might find it difficult, as even the main character is not very lovable, he is a week and very human in other words. It's not a 'feel good' film but not miserablism, it's smart and innovative reminder",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "I just watched this movie last night for the first time. I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.<br/><br/>The movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.<br/><br/>I feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.<br/><br/>If I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it. It's too late now - I can't get it out of my head. I don't think I've ever been affected this much by a movie.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "First of all, Seven Years In Tibet is a very aesthetically pleasing film. The snowy Himalayas, the Tibetan villages, and the amazing costumes and religious ceremonies are all filmed beautifully, with rich colours and lighting. The music by John Williams is also excellent, and it's fascinating to hear how it blends with the unusual Tibetan music.<br/><br/>It's not all surface though, there's depth here too. Don't believe the negative comments about Brad Pitt's acting. Admittedly his accent slips a bit in places, but he does a great job as Heinrich, both the unpleasant, arrogant character at the beginning, and the more gentle and wise man that he becomes as the film progresses. His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental. The film is well edited; scenes are not drawn out any longer than they need to be. As a whole, it is fast paced but also peaceful, tender and moving. You don't get bored but you're not bombarded with pointless action scenes either.<br/><br/>It's a pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood film where women and other cultures aren't treated as objects, and are allowed to be full, complex characters. It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.<br/><br/>Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended.",
    "Ice age 3 was really funny and it stays true to the series. Same old characters, a whole new adventure that everyone at any age can enjoy.<br/><br/>I saw the critics and I thought to my self that it would be good, but I didn't expect much, but I really did enjoy it more than I thought. It may not be the best compared to the other Ice Age films, but it still a great thrill ride that the audience can enjoy.<br/><br/>And if you find a theater near you that has it in digital 3D, go and watch it in 3D, because the action and adventure will excite you even more than it actually does.<br/><br/>Normally people think since it's a third part, then the movie won't be that great, but hear me when I say that keep that thought out of your mind and parents, take your kids with you, they are sure to leave with a smile and a long lasting excitement for more.<br/><br/>100% enjoyable, its a 10!",
    "I love this movie! It was so adorable, so charming & the writing was absolutely terrific! I love the animation & the characters (including the minions) were all fantastic! A MUST WATCH!",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. <br/><br/>The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! <br/><br/>For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it. Go see this.",
    "I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.<br/><br/>Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "I am written this review In Memorie of my all time favorite the best horror director Wes Craven that sadly is no longer with us anymore. On August 30th 2015, Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him. <br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. <br/><br/>The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death, I love it!!! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my number 1 favorite film in the franchise it stays in my heart forever. I am a big fan of this film I even have a poster hang on door in my room, my girlfriend give it to me as gift. I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare, Scream, Shocker,The People Under the Stairs, Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross $26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream , New Nightmare, Shocker and The People Under the Stairs. <br/><br/>The first film is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams, a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers, can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams, you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger, she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams, but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever, smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put booby-traps for Freddy? Awesome!<br/><br/>Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss, is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. <br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. <br/><br/>Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films. <br/><br/>John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson, Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome, I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. <br/><br/>I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is the best classic slasher film,one of the best horror movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. My number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film, it is fast paced, entertaining, not boring or over long film, but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
    "Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as \"Sergeant Major Dickerson\",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.",
    "We all remember being a teenager.  A crazy, intense time when your high were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant.<br/><br/>John Hughes movie brilliantly captures that environment, that era in our lives, and all the social rifts that we all helped to create for ourselves. I have heard it said that \"The Breakfast Club\" is melodramatic, overacted, and simplistic.  If you subscribe to that flippant perspective you might as well join Vernon in his office because you are doing the same thing that he did.  Seeing the movie as you want to see it, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.<br/><br/>If you really want to understand this film, think back to your own high school days.  Think about your last year there.  Dig out your old diary or book of angstful poems and reaquaint yourself with who you were then, when you felt things more deeply.  \"The Breakfast Club\" does not exist not for highschool kids, as some suggest.  Why would they need it?  They live there. It exists for all of us who have already been through there, who feel that they are above it now.  It exists so that we can remember what it was like and better understand ourselves, and the next generation.  Because you can't dismiss something you understand.",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br/><br/>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br/><br/>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br/><br/>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br/><br/>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br/><br/>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br/><br/>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are great again<br/><br/>Charm returns<br/><br/>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Only one movie with Baby Groot?

    "I have only ever seen this film once, I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence.  I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment.",
    "As most are undoubtedly aware this is the film that the director virtually expunged from his repertoire. But why did Stanley Kubrick really disown SPARTACUS (1960)? The answer can be summed up in two words: absolute control. Kubrick wanted total administrative as well as artistic authority over the making of the film about a revolt of gladiators and slaves in ancient Rome.<br/><br/>But you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY (1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well. Only three weeks into what would prove to be an incredibly complex and arduous production, Douglas fired venerable director Anthony Mann (RAW DEAL, RAILROADED,THE FURIES, THE NAKED SPUR, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, MAN OF THE WEST, etc.) from SPARTACUS. With only two days notice, Kubrick was hired to replace him.<br/><br/>Shooting PATHS OF GLORY, Douglas had confined his criticisms and objections to Kubrick's failed rewriting of the script (they went with the original screenplay). Douglas' complaints and artistic influence were far greater on SPARTACUS, much to Kubrick's chagrin. Though the director craved autonomy over every aspect of the film, Douglas would not budge. A tense compromise was reached but ultimately Douglas had the last word. Kubrick saw himself as just a hired gun. And he would never allow himself to be placed in this position again.<br/><br/>Later, both men would complain about the film's outcome and each other. They never made another movie together. <br/><br/>But SPARTACUS is no uneven patchwork of divergent ideas. The film is cohesive and arresting. At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.",
    "I think this film is wonderful. It is sheer entertainment for kids and hilarious for adults.<br/><br/>I first watched this movie age 7, and i loved it...now i watch it again age 14 and I'm howling with laughter. The 'You wanna buy a sundial?' sequence renders me unable to breathe for laughter, whilst when i was younger it got not so much as a giggle.<br/><br/>As with all Disney films, the jokes are for the 'big kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!<br/><br/>Overall - 8/10",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.<br/><br/>And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.<br/><br/>Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.<br/><br/>The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.<br/><br/>O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",
    "This film was exceptional and one of the best I've seen this year. Watiti has great comedic vision and the cast is phenomenal. Jojo Rabbit was wierd , funny , heartwarming and heartbreaking and I think its definitely worth the watch.",
    "I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no \"Finding Nemo\" or \"Toy Story.\" But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!<br/><br/>In my opinion, Cars 1 was a little slow. It dragged a little too long in certain parts. Cars 2 suffers from no such thing.<br/><br/>To sum it up; Cars 2 may not be Toy Story but it sure is FUN and ENTERTAINING.",
    "I am truly sadden that this film got bashed so much. I hear reviews saying this film \"sucks\" or it has too many inaccuracies. Movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List have also \"some\" inaccuracies in them. (They are Masterpieces) It is pretty sad this film has been getting this bashed. It doesn't deserve to be.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is full of suspense and is directed beautifully by Kathryn Bigelow. I'd have to say this is movie truly captures the Iraq War. What a dangerous war it was for our soldiers. This movie shows us what our soldiers went through. This isn't bashing the American soldiers at all or even War. It gives us a great deal of appreciation for our troops who are risking their lives every single day for Us, Freedom and the U.S.A.<br/><br/>The true purpose of this movie is to not just praise the soldiers. But for one of the military's unrecognized heroes which are the technicians of the bombs squads who risk their lives to save others. This is the purpose of the movie to let everyone know what these people do.<br/><br/>This time and I know all of you out there, don't want to hear it, the critics are actually right. This movie is fantastically directed by Kathryn Bigelow and she rightfully deserved her Oscar for best director.<br/><br/>I know many Avatar fans out there probably rated this movie a 1, without even seeing it because it won Best Picture and Avatar didn't. This movie seems its suffering from the curse of Best Picture. More people have watched Avatar than the Hurt Locker. So of course this film has gotten bashed by so many. I think SOME of the bad reviews are the Avatar Fanboys who are just angry Avatar didn't win Best Picture.<br/><br/>Please don't just go along with the bad reviews this film has gotten from IMDb. Just try and watch this film.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a war epic, that I hope it becomes appreciative as time passes. 9/10 Highly recommended.",
    "It's funny, but I notice most of the prior comments are from guys, but speaking as a woman, this is by no means just a guy's flick. It's been one of my favorite films since the day it came out. It's got everything- drama, romance, action, and an honest to goodness story. There are even interesting themes, like the moral dilemma that Wyatt finds himself in-- Is he compelled to help fight the Cowboys even though he's \"retired\" and just wants to live out his life in peace? Is there a moral equivalence between killing for justice and killing for retribution? How far can a man go to sacrifice his own integrity and better judgment? Even though the Earps are the \"good guys\", the movie doesn't glamorize violence. Doc Holliday and some of the Earps' other sidekicks (\"Creek Johnson\" and \"Texas Jack\") are obviously pretty shady characters, but at the end of the day, are forced to choose between right and wrong, and they choose correctly. It doesn't get much better than Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and I can't for the life of me understand why he didn't get nominated for it. I also appreciate the fact that the love story between Wyatt and Josephine didn't dominate the film and take away from the real plot, ala \"Titanic\". The love story simply served its purpose in helping viewers to better understand the character of Wyatt. Also the friendship between Wyatt and Doc was portrayed tenderly but not wussily. And okay, as a woman, let me just say that there is no one sexier than Sam Elliot. Man alive, if there ever was a person born to portray a cowboy, that guy is IT. If you've never seen a Western, or are not a fan, try this movie. It will make a believer out of you.",

    "SAW III in my opinion is tied with the original as the best in the series. For many reasons- one reason being that it keeps it simple. Instead of dealing with multiple characters that sacrificed any kind of character development like in SAW's II, IV, and V, SAW III, like the original, has much fewer characters, leading to a more intimate setting where we can connect to everyone. And while it does have sub-plots, they don't feel out of place, they're not just randomly thrown in to shock audiences. They feel organic, they all connect smoothly at the end and make sense as to why.<br/><br/>If you've seen a SAW film, you know the story is going to have twists, turns, and violence/gore to accompany them. But at least SAW III does it very well. It expands on characterization and back stories for these characters and ties up the loose ends as believably as this franchise can do. We also get a deeper look at the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, knowing more about how the two really look at each other. Jigsaw is the calm, cancer-stricken anti-hero who does these evil things to prove a moral standpoint. Amanda, on the other hand, doesn't seem to grasp this - instead using the traps to torture her victims as a way to get back at innocent people for the way she was tortured herself with suicidal tendencies and drug abuse. With these two extremes, we see how much Jigsaw is trying to mentor her in his vision while she struggles with her own demons. And when Jigsaw gets ill, we see that Amanda really isn't a fitting apprentice to carry on his legacy as her vindictiveness comes out.<br/><br/>SAW III is also supported by the fact that the two protagonists are developed deeply. Maybe not as much as our two anti-heros, but we understand where they're coming from. From Lynn's dour nature to devastated Jeff's situation. The subplot with Jeff by the way adds some great underlying messages to the film. These messages shows us that hate, vengeance, revenge, and complacency brings more pain than anything else, and does not solve anything. It ruins families, destroys relationships, clouds judgment, and at the end: self-destruction. Leigh Whannell, who wrote the first two films with James Waan and flew solo writing the screenplay for this one, does a nice job giving the spotlight to all the characters instead of just focusing on Jigsaw and Amanda. He makes SAW III more of a character study than any of the other installments and that's one of the essential reasons why this installment scores high.<br/><br/>Darren Lynn Bousman directs a much more subtle film than he did with SAW II and SAW IV. The quick edits are kept to a bare minimum (thank God) and the film has a lot of dread going for it. Very moody and darkly atmospheric. He focuses on the drama and emotion at hand, which was a vast improvement on SAW II and especially SAW IV. He lets the acting and the situations do the work for him instead of being extra-fancy with the camera work. Lastly, the cinematography is a plus. Darren shoots the film with a vibrant and kinetic feel and uses good, non-queasy camera movements. I love the lighting most of all though; he uses a wide arrange in the color palette (from lime green to icy blue). He definitely proves here that he knows how to grasp the material and visualize it. His direction of III ranks alongside James Waan's mindblowing direction of the original.<br/><br/>The acting is hardly an issue. It's usually good or better. Tobin Bell can play John Kramer in his sleep by now for gods sake! He shows excellent range and is always effective in the role because he gives the character more depth than what the script probably provides. Shawnee Smith is superb as Amanda, who will always be one of my favorite characters in the series. This is without a single doubt her shining moment, her most dramatic portion in the series. You really want to hate her but you just can't because you pity her. Smith could have easily played the character as an annoying nutjob, but she gives the character substance and unbelievable humanality. Angus Macfadyen as Jeff is superb in his role as well; he makes Jeff the most realistic and sympathetic character within the entire series. As far as I'm concerned, McFayden nailed the mourning father act. Bahar Soomekh was decent but always outshone by Bell, Smith, and McFayden. Her acting was a bit flimsy at times, but for the most part she gave a nice performance and made her character likable.<br/><br/>The suspense and tension, while not as impressive as the original, is still great. Hardly any other Saw film or horror film in general for that matter (with the exception of Eden Lake from last year and Inside from 2007) has been so edge-of-your-seat gripping, so exciting. The slow pacing allows you to gradually absorb everything in, and this makes it all the more better.<br/><br/>There is a lot of extreme gore in this film, but unlike some other installments like Saws IV and V, it's done very well and serves a purpose. Jeff's bloody trials are in a lot of ways cathartic. You're enduring these horrific scenes along with Jeff, and the relief at the end that the horror is over really fits with the theme of redemption through forgiveness. Moreover, the revelation that the horror isn't over, and what you feel as a result, drives home the Shakespearean tragedy in a very personal way because you the audience have to keep enduring it.<br/><br/>SAW III is clever, solidly written, has the best characters, succeeds with the emotional aspect it was going for, and ties up loose ends perfectly. For a third installment in a horror series, it's incredibly strong.",
    "And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive \"Spider-Man\" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.",

Sure she could be scared (of being revealed to be a fraud by the true her) but not of a shadow. Again, purposeful misleading to set up the twist.<br/><br/>3. Why does the good version go insane and deciude the only way to get revenge on her evil self is to raise an army of evil duplicates that murder their good halves? Again, contrived and makes no sense.<br/><br/>4. Why didn't/ couldn't the good version of the girl use the escalators to escape the evil realm? This really doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>5. How the hell did all of the evil versions have enough food/ water to survive?<br/><br/>6. Surely not every single copy of everyone in the world was stored in the one bunker shown. So how did the \"Good\" girl convince all of the evil copies (of all the rest of the world) to arise??<br/><br/>There are probably many many MANY more issues with this film. But god does it destroy itself trying way too hard to set up a profound twist that is just completely illogical.",
    "Don't believe the negative reviews on this one. Its easily the most underrated movie I have come across, and can best be described as a hidden gem for the ones who like historical adventure/action-movies (Braveheart/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/Robin Hood) and fantasy-movies. <br/><br/>Others have described it better here on IMDb, so I am just going to say this: It is not a historical correct piece, and do not try to be. It should be viewed as a fantasy, even though the vikings portrayed and their buildings/settlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.<br/><br/>Btw: To all you who like the above-mentioned movies for the big battle-scenes and sword-fighting, don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area (even though it got them). On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in pre-medieval times. Instead of having the one super-hero defying all logic, you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie, with Banderas, Storhøi and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.<br/><br/>This is a great adventure of a movie, which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.<br/><br/>9/10 - Must see for all who like adventure/fantasy",
    "Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head. You can't help but incredulously laugh at what happens. This is all about oddballs.<br/><br/>The good. Excellent acting. Totally off the wall characters, actions and situations, yet completely logical. Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.<br/><br/>The actors. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovich play disturbingly crazy roles stuffed with delusion and heavily dosed with stupidity. While Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons seem almost out of place as the standard bearers of reason.<br/><br/>The bad. Since it's so bizarre, it won't please everyone.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. Offbeat and cooky comedy. Don't think you'll see your run of the mill kind of film and you'll have fun.",
    "I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on \"the list\" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like \"Superbad\", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of \"40 Year Old Virgin\", \"Superbad\", or \"Knocked Up\".<br/><br/>For starters, there was a definite presence of the \"TV actors on the big screen\" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of \"That 70s Show\" didn't follow her to \"Forgetting\"'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that \"Forgetting\" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than \"American Psycho 2\" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.<br/><br/>The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.<br/><br/>The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on \"CSI\") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious \"American Psycho 2\"); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with \"Superbad\"). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt \"Knocked Up\"). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write \"Fun with Dick and Jane\".<br/><br/>All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'. <br/><br/>The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events. <br/><br/>In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.<br/><br/>One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.<br/><br/>Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games). <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work. <br/><br/>These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.<br/><br/>Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.<br/><br/>What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children. <br/><br/>Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain.",
    "In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:<br/><br/>First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: \nIs Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?<br/><br/>Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.<br/><br/>During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",
    "I was talked into seeing this, and I have to shout it out, because it is a RIOT! I don't write many reviews, but when I love a film, I have to. If I have any complaint on this one, it's the title. I expected gross-out humor (\"crude\"). There isn't any, really. It's actually extremely unpredictable, subtle and extremely smart humor.<br/><br/>It has a story arc that you begin to somewhat anticipate, but you don't feel you're being patronized. Instead, you're left feeling that very intelligent people put this thing together in hopes that everyone would find something to love about it.<br/><br/>The cast is great, the animation is fun, and it's non-dizzying 3-D.<br/><br/>When I saw it, the entire audience clapped at the end, because we were entertained throughout, and found the ending really satisfying.<br/><br/>What else? Sweet emotions crop up because we can all relate to the family dynamics. Every family has the screw-up, the salt of the earth, the rebel, and the stubborn one. And it has one of the funniest babies ever put on film. A baby unlike any baby you'll ever see anywhere.<br/><br/>Very, very funny. Definitely recommend.",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.<br/><br/>Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to \"Christmas Town\". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.<br/><br/>People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! <br/><br/>10/10",
    "\"Atonement\" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. <br/><br/>Act I begins like an upper-class comedy of manners. The setting is the Tallis family's stately home, on a hot summer's day in 1935. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old with ambitions to be a writer, has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins, but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them. Robbie has fallen in love with Cecilia and accidentally sends her a sexually explicit love-letter. In other circumstances this might have resulted in disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one. The tone of the film changes abruptly, however, when Briony's cousin Lola is sexually assaulted. Lola cannot identify her assailant, but Briony, who was a witness, falsely accuses Robbie. As a result, he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison. <br/><br/>In Act II, set in 1940, Robbie, released from jail, is now a soldier with the British Army in France. He is desperately trying to reach Dunkirk ahead of the advancing Germans, kept going not by fighting spirit or patriotism, but by the hope of returning to Cecilia, who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment, becoming estranged from her family as a result. In Act III we see Briony, now eighteen, as a volunteer nurse in a London hospital. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help him clear his name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apart.<br/><br/>After \"The Last King of Scotland\" and \"Becoming Jane\", James McEvoy is the rising male star of the British cinema, and his performance here is the best yet that I have seen. Whereas Dr Garrigan in \"The Last King\" was morally flawed, and Lefroy in \"Becoming Jane\" hid his better nature beneath a roguish exterior, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy succeeds in conveying his character's basic decency, achieving the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is another rising British star, and this is her second film with director Joe Wright after \"Pride and Prejudice\". Although she was good in the comedy \"Bend it like Beckham\", I think that her films with Wright are her best, suggesting that her future lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" in which she seemed miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the loveliest, but also the liveliest and most spirited heroine of any film I have seen recently. Special mentions must also go to Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and to Vanessa Redgrave who plays the now-elderly Briony in the epilogue, set in 1999. I felt, however, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. <br/><br/>This was only Wright's second feature film, and he has already established himself as an accomplished director. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a good film, but \"Atonement\" is better. Ian McEwan's book is among the best novels of recent years, and I doubt if any cinematic treatment could capture all its nuances. One of its themes in particular, the debate between literary traditionalism and modernism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wright and the scriptwriter Christopher Hampton wisely steer clear of it. Hampton, who has turned the book into a very good screenplay, keeps McEwan's final twist, although it is here presented in a different way, with Briony revealing the truth in an TV interview. <br/><br/>If, however, the film does not capture all the literary nuances of the novel, Wright makes up for this with his extraordinary visual imagination, something sometimes lacking in films based upon novels. \"Atonement\" joins that list of films (\"Far from Heaven\" and \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" are other examples that come to mind) where almost every scene seems composed like a painting. This is true not only of Act I, set in that beautiful stately home (actually Stokesay Court in Shropshire), but also of Act II, where Wright can find a terrible beauty even in war, especially in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot of the Dunkirk beaches in the grey morning light. Particularly moving was the scene where the British soldiers sing \"Dear Lord and Father of Mankind\". The second line of John Greenleaf Whittier's hymn is, of course, \"Forgive Our Foolish Ways\"- a particularly apt comment on war, and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the characters.<br/><br/>Also very good was Dario Marianelli's musical score, which (appropriately for a film in which writing plays an important part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping. Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that its British origins and late summer (traditionally blockbuster season) release date will not prejudice the Academy against it when it comes to next year's Oscars. 9/10",

    "Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised \" Esther's secret\" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the \"secret\" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a \"creepy\" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",
    "I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.<br/><br/>At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.<br/><br/>There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.",

    "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \"Scarface\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \"American Dream\".<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about the \"cheesiness\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.<br/><br/>This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.<br/><br/>The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.<br/><br/>Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \"Scarface\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original \"Willy Wonka\" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",

    "Mass amateurization refers to the capabilities that new forms of media have given to non-professionals and the ways in which those non-professionals have applied those capabilities to solve problems (e.g. create and distribute content) that compete with the solutions offered by larger, professional institutions. Mass amateurization is most often associated with Web 2.0 technologies. These technologies include the rise of blogs and citizen journalism, photo and video-sharing services such as Flickr and YouTube, user-generated wikis like Wikipedia, and distributed accommodation services such as Airbnb. While the social web is not the only technology responsible for the rise of mass amateurization, Clay Shirky claims Web 2.0 has allowed amateurs to undertake increasingly complex tasks resulting in accomplishments that would seem daunting within the traditional institutional model. In addition to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed a variety of digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, trackbacks, and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during the first decade of the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media. Mass amateurization is a social, cumulative and collaborative activity, wherein ideas will flow back up the pipeline from consumers and they will share them among themselves.",

    "Bass–Serre theory is a part of the mathematical subject of group theory that deals with analyzing the algebraic structure of groups acting by automorphisms on simplicial trees. The theory relates group actions on trees with decomposing groups as iterated applications of the operations of free product with amalgamation and HNN extension, via the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. Bass–Serre theory can be regarded as one-dimensional version of the orbifold theory. History\nBass–Serre theory was developed by Jean-Pierre Serre in the 1970s and formalized in Trees, Serre's 1977 monograph (developed in collaboration with Hyman Bass) on the subject. Serre's original motivation was to understand the structure of certain algebraic groups whose Bruhat–Tits buildings are trees. However, the theory quickly became a standard tool of geometric group theory and geometric topology, particularly the study of 3-manifolds. Subsequent work of Bass contributed substantially to the formalization and development of basic tools of the theory and currently the term \"Bass–Serre theory\" is widely used to describe the subject.",
    "Hemoglobin Barts, abbreviated Hb Barts, is an abnormal type of hemoglobin that consists of four gamma globins. It is moderately insoluble, and therefore accumulates in the red blood cells. Hb Barts has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, so it cannot release oxygen to the tissue. Therefore, this makes it an inefficient oxygen carrier. As an embryo develops, it begins to produce alpha-globins at weeks 5–6 of development. When both of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes which code for alpha globins becomes dysfunctional, the affected fetuses will have difficulty in synthesizing a functional hemoglobin. As a result, gamma chains will accumulate and form four gamma globins. These gamma globins bind to form hemoglobin Barts. It is produced in the disease alpha-thalassemia and in the most severe of cases, it is the only form of hemoglobin in circulation. In this situation, a fetus will develop hydrops fetalis and normally die before or shortly after birth, unless intrauterine blood transfusion is performed. Since hemoglobin Barts is elevated in alpha thalassemia, it can be measured, providing a useful screening test for this disease in some populations.",

    "High Angle Control System (HACS) was a British anti-aircraft fire-control system employed by the Royal Navy from 1931 onwards and used widely during World War II. HACS calculated the necessary deflection required to place an explosive shell in the location of a target flying at a known height, bearing and speed. Early history\nThe HACS was first proposed in the 1920s and began to appear on Royal Navy (RN) ships in January 1930, when HACS I went to sea in . HACS I did not have any stabilization or power assist for director training. HACS III which appeared in 1935, had provision for stabilization, was hydraulically driven, featured much improved data transmission and it introduced the HACS III Table. The HACS III table (computer) had numerous improvements including raising maximum target speed to 350 knots, continuous automatic fuze prediction, improved geometry in the deflection Screen, and provisions for gyro inputs to provide stabilization of data received from the director. The HACS was a control system and was made possible by an effective data transmission network between an external gun director, a below decks fire control computer, and the ship's medium calibre anti-aircraft (AA) guns.",

Typically, the different types of asset-based loans include accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, equipment financing, or real estate financing Asset-based lending in this more specific sense is possible only in certain countries whose legal systems allow borrowers to pledge such assets to lenders as collateral for loans (through the creation of enforceable security interests). Usage\nAsset-based lending is usually done when the normal routes of raising funds is not possible, such as the capital markets (selling bonds to investors) and normal unsecured or mortgage secured bank. This is often because the company has exhausted other capital raising options or needs more immediate capital for project financing needs (such as inventory purchases, mergers, acquisitions, and debt purchasing). Asset-based loans are also usually accompanied by lower interest rates, as in the event of a default the lender can recoup its investment by seizing and liquidating the assets tied to the loan.",

The simplest, or most evasive, approach is RAM-scraping, accessing the system's memory and exporting the copied information via a remote access trojan (RAT) as this minimizes any software or hardware tampering, potentially leaving no footprints. POS attacks may also include the use of various bits of hardware: dongles, trojan card readers, (wireless) data transmitters and receivers. Being at the gateway of transactions, POS malware enables hackers to process and steal thousands, even millions, of transaction payment data, depending upon the target, the number of devices affected, and how long the attack goes undetected. This is done before or outside of the card information being (usually) encrypted and sent to the payment processor for authorization. List of POS RAM scraper malware variants",

    "Chakán (, ‘1) oregano of this land; 2) macaw tail feathers.’) is the name of one of the Mayan jurisdictions (kuchkabalob) that existed on the Yucatan Peninsula at the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the sixteenth century. Unlike other jurisdictions, Chakán did not seem to have a centralized government or control of a dominant Halach Uinik, as in the case of the provinces Ceh Pech or Ah Kin Chel. This is inferred from the fact that upon the Spaniards' arrival, Francisco de Montejo (el Mozo) was well received by some local leaders (batabob), but not others, such as Ah Kin Chuy, who organized resistance in the region's eastern towns to repel Spanish settlers. The most important city in the jurisdiction may have been Caucel, which controlled the region's salt trade since this material came from Chuburná and Sisal. Caucel's batab, named Ah Kin Euán, was so open to the Spanish from the outset of the conquest that he converted to Catholicism and changed his name to Francisco Euán, maintaining his position as batab for much longer.",

    "European exploration and settlement of Oceania began in the 16th century, starting with Portuguese settling the Moluccas and Spanish (Castilian) landings and shipwrecks in the Marianas Islands, east of the Philippines, followed by the Portuguese landing and settling  temporarily (due to the monsoons) in the Tanimbar or the Aru Islands and in some of the Caroline Islands and Papua New Guinea, and several Spanish landings in the Caroline Islands and New Guinea. Subsequent rivalry between European colonial powers, trade opportunities and Christian missions drove further European exploration and eventual settlement. After the 17th century Dutch landings in New Zealand and Australia, but not settling these lands, the British became the dominant colonial power in the region, establishing settler colonies in what would become Australia and New Zealand, both of which now have majority European-descended populations. States including New Caledonia (Caldoche), Hawaii, French Polynesia and Norfolk Island also have considerable European populations. Europeans remain a primary ethnic group in much of Oceania, both numerically and economically. European settlement and colonization"

    "Rugby league officials in Wales are pushing for more structured and focused training routines amid increasing popularity and participation in the sport, aiming for a level of competitiveness that rivals those of traditionally dominant regions.\n\nFollowing the steady growth of the sport in Wales, the necessity of a Rugby training league has become more pertinent. The rugby body is keen on harnessing the raw talents in the region through formal training as they aim for a space at the top in international tournaments.\n\n\"Rugby has been growing tremendously in the past few years here, but we've been lacking the necessary professional training structure,\" says Dave Blackwood, chairperson of the rugby league in Wales. He believes that increased training will significantly raise the skill level of players in recent years and foster a more competitive local league.\n\nThe success of the Wales national rugby team in the recent Rugby World Cup has served as an inspiration to many in the sporting community, and according to Blackwood, it has significantly increased interest in the sport. He adds, \"We are eyeing the sports schools, colleges, and various sports organisations to collaborate and set up dedicated training camps.\"\n\nThe proposed training league will not only focus on the technical and tactical elements of rugby. There are broader plans to include modules on sports psychology, nutrition, and recovery protocols in the training curriculum, aimed at developing well-rounded athletes.\n\nCritics of the move argue that it might affect the spontaneity and raw excitement of the game. However, Blackwood disagrees. He says, \"It's not about formalizing everything. It's about providing support, structure, and training to those who are interested in the sport. It's about celebrating and nurturing the passion for rugby in Wales.\"\n\nThe proposal is to initiate the training league from early spring 2023, with the local leagues providing a pipeline of talent. The rugby authorities believe that the move will not only enhance the sport but also provide a multitude of opportunities for young players in Wales.\n\nIn conclusion, professionals and enthusiasts alike laud the move. The implementation of a professional training structure is seen as a significant step up in the ongoing development of rugby in Wales. A structured training approach could indeed be the game-changer that transforms the face of rugby in Wales and puts them on the international sports radar.",
    "The UK's manufacturing sector is facing a significant threat, with thousands of jobs at risk, prompting urgent calls for government intervention to save the industry. \n\nThe manufacturing industry, which contributes £192 billion to the economy and employs 2.7 million people, has been hit hard by the ongoing pandemic and the aftermath of Brexit. The sector has seen a sharp decline in output, with many companies struggling to stay afloat. \n\nTrade unions and industry leaders are now urging the government to step in and provide much-needed support to prevent further job losses. They are calling for a comprehensive recovery plan that includes financial aid, tax incentives, and measures to boost domestic demand for UK-made products. \n\n\"Without immediate action, we risk losing a significant portion of our manufacturing base and the high-skilled jobs it provides,\" warned Stephen Phipson, CEO of Make UK, the manufacturers' organisation. \"This is not just about protecting the present, but also safeguarding the future of manufacturing in the UK.\"\n\nThe call comes as new data reveals that the manufacturing sector contracted by 10% in 2020, the largest fall in output since the financial crisis of 2008. The automotive and aerospace industries have been particularly affected, with thousands of jobs already lost.\n\nUnite, the country's largest trade union, has also voiced its concern. \"The government must act now to save our manufacturing jobs and invest in the future of this vital sector,\" said Unite's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. \"We need a clear, long-term industrial strategy that supports our manufacturers and promotes growth.\"\n\nThe government has responded to the calls, stating that it recognises the importance of the manufacturing sector and is committed to supporting it. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"We are working closely with the industry to understand the challenges it faces and will continue to provide support through our various business support schemes.\"\n\nHowever, critics argue that the current support measures are not enough and that more targeted assistance is needed to save jobs and stimulate growth in the sector. They are calling for a more proactive approach, including direct investment in key industries, increased support for research and development, and measures to promote skills training and apprenticeships.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is a crucial part of the UK economy, not only in terms of output and employment but also in driving innovation and regional development. The loss of manufacturing jobs would have far-reaching implications, affecting local communities and supply chains across the country. \n\nAs the UK navigates its post-Brexit future and continues",
    "The world of casual gaming is set to 'take off' in a big way, according to industry experts. With the rise of mobile technology and the increasing accessibility of gaming platforms, more and more people are turning to casual games as a form of entertainment.\n\nCasual games, which are typically easy to learn and play, are attracting a diverse range of players, from busy professionals looking for a quick break, to parents seeking a fun and engaging activity for their children. The global casual gaming market is expected to reach $8.1 billion by 2023, according to a report by Market Research Future.\n\nThe rise of casual gaming can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the proliferation of smartphones and tablets has made gaming more accessible than ever before. People can now play games anytime, anywhere, whether they're on the commute, waiting in line, or simply relaxing at home.\n\nSecondly, the nature of casual games makes them appealing to a wide audience. Unlike hardcore games, which often require significant time investment and skill, casual games are designed to be picked up and played in short bursts. They often feature simple, intuitive controls and straightforward objectives, making them accessible to players of all ages and skill levels.\n\nThe social aspect of casual gaming is another key factor in its rise. Many casual games feature multiplayer modes, leaderboards, and social media integration, allowing players to compete with friends and share their achievements. This adds a layer of competition and community to the gaming experience, making it more engaging and enjoyable.\n\nThe rise of casual gaming is also being driven by the increasing popularity of free-to-play models. Many casual games are free to download and play, with optional in-app purchases offering additional content or advantages. This model allows players to try out a game without any financial commitment, making it more appealing to those who are new to gaming or hesitant to spend money on it.\n\nIndustry experts predict that the casual gaming market will continue to grow in the coming years, driven by technological advancements, evolving consumer habits, and the ongoing popularity of mobile gaming. As more people discover the joy of casual gaming, it's clear that this sector of the gaming industry is set to soar to new heights.",
    "American retailers experienced a mixed Christmas trading period, with online sales surging but brick-and-mortar stores seeing muted consumer activity. While many shoppers chose to spend their holiday budgets on digital platforms, physical store revenues failed to mirror this spending spree.\n\nE-commerce giants, including Amazon and Walmart, reported record-breaking online sales over the holiday period. Amazon mentioned its customers purchased billions of items worldwide and offered more than 8 million items available for same-day delivery which assisted in driving up the numbers. Walmart also benefited from its thriving online sector, with a particular focus on toys, electronics and home products. Independent e-commerce platforms also experienced burgeoning demand, further emphasizing the strength of the digital marketplace.\n\nHowever, brick-and-mortar stores largely failed to recoup the losses incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to reports from the National Retail Federation (NRF), many traditional retailers recorded moderate sales at best over the festive period. Footfall in shopping malls and on high streets was significantly lower than pre-pandemic seasons. Despite the relaxation of some social distancing measures, fear of the virus and new habits established during lockdowns kept numerous consumers away.\n\nConsumer behavior appears to have been shaped in part by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, with many shoppers opting for the safety and convenience of online shopping rather than risking exposure in physical stores.\n\nHowever, there were exceptions within the retail sector. Companies offering a blend of physical and online retail, known as omnichannel retailing, recorded substantial performances. These retailers benefited from services like \"click and collect\" and \"buy online, pick up in store\", which offered a convenient compromise for cautious consumers.\n\nThe continued growth of e-commerce signals a shift in consumer habits which could have far-reaching consequences for the retail landscape. As more customers turn towards online options, traditional retailers might have to reconsider their strategies to stay competitive.\n\nYet, it's also worth noting that brick-and-mortar stores still hold appeal for a demographic that values the tactile, immersive experience of physical shopping. Some experts argue these traditional shopping experiences can be enhanced by technology, integrating the best of both worlds.\n\nChallenges, therefore, remain. A mixed Christmas performance underlines a tale of two halves in retail – those steadfastly riding the digital wave, and those struggling to stay afloat in a turbulent retail ocean. As we move into the new year, it will be interesting to watch how the sector responds to the opportunities and issues this presents.",
    "In George Orwell's dystopian novel, '1984', the term 'Big Brother' was introduced to the world as a symbolic representation of the all-seeing, omnipotent government. Decades later, have we moved from symbolism to reality? Perhaps, if we take the time to analyse our modern surveillance states.\n\nFirst coined in 1948, 'Big Brother' has been a metaphor for a metanomic state entity capable of watching and recording every action and thought of the populace. Despite a slew of debates on privacy, surveillance has only become more prevalent in our society, with countless CCTVs in public spaces, companies tracking our online movements, and governments steadily increasing their electronic surveillance capabilities.\n\nThe power and influence once attributed solely to Orwell's fictitious entity now find iterations worldwide. The USA's National Security Agency, China's social credit system, and even our everyday interactions with tech companies like Google and Facebook are giving flesh and blood to 'Big Brother' in ways Orwell might have never imagined.\n\nChina's social credit system, often perceived as a surveillance beast, records every citizen's social, financial, and legal activities. It aims at 'civilising' society by rewarding or punishing citizens based on their 'trustworthiness'. Not far behind is the USA's National Security and Surveillance division, with whistleblower Edward Snowden unveiling their widespread surveillance programs in 2013.\n\nCloser home, major tech companies play a pivotal role in understanding the viewership patterns, purchasing tendencies, and overall behavioural traits of users. The algorithms designed by these tech giants can accurately predict user behaviour and preferences based on collected data. This level of surveillance, mostly justified for offering personalised user experiences, raises significant privacy concerns.\n\nBut those behind the curtain, governing this exercise in monitoring, are mostly institutions and digital enterprises instead of individuals. Although these national and international mechanisms have been likened to 'Big Brother', exactly who or what embodies 'Big Brother' is up for interpretation.\n\nThe physical embodiment of 'Big Brother' doesn't exist, yet its manifestation lives on in our everyday life. Despite being anonymous, 'Big Brother' isn't invisible. It watches us through a myriad of channels- be it the hidden CCTVs in our local parks or the seemingly harmless cookies tracking us even as we surf the internet.\n\nIn essence, the face of 'Big Brother' is disjointed, represented by bureaucratic institutions, tech platforms, and algorithmic systems that might just know us a bit too well. It is not the Orwellian figure looming over our lives, but a network of systems and individuals simpl",
    "A landmark agreement has been reached that will potentially see the prohibition of reggae music deemed homophobic. This move comes in response to widespread criticism against certain tracks that allegedly propagate hostility towards the LGBTQ+ community. \n\nLeading music labels and campaigners opposing hate speech have combined their forces to secure this significant deal. The contractual terms assert that any reggae song with homophobic lyrics will no longer see production or distribution under major music labels.\n\nCritics of certain strands of reggae have expressed concerns for years about lyrics that they believe incite violence towards those in the LGBTQ+ community. This agreement represents a massive shift in the music industry's approach towards tackling hate speech.\n\nPeter Tatchell, a prominent LGBTQ+ rights campaigner, has long called for the ban of such music. He welcomed this new agreement, stating, \"This is a significant milestone. It sends a clear message that hate speech toward any community, including the LGBTQ+ people, will not be tolerated in music.\"\n\nMeanwhile, several reggae artists are seen debating the imminent changes. They emphasize that a line has to be drawn between freedom of expressions and propagation of hate speech. Some argue that their music merely reflects cultural attitudes, though they acknowledge that many of these attitudes are seen as discriminatory by Western societies.\n\nThe CEO of a leading music label, who wished to remain anonymous, said, \"This is a delicate matter. On the one hand, we have freedom of speech and creative expression. On the other, we have a responsibility not to spread hate speech. This deal is a step in the direction of balance between these two important ideals.\"\n\nNonetheless, there is a consensus within the industry that diminishing homophobic content is necessary for the music scene's progress and betterment.\n\nThe agreement could set a precedent globally in the music industry on tackling issues related to homophobia and all forms of discrimination. However, its effect would heavily rely on its successful implementation and also on how fans react to the proposed changes.\n\nThere is still much work to do regarding LGBTQ+ rights within the reggae community and beyond. However, this agreement shows a promising move in the right direction, expressing the music industry's commitment to foster a more inclusive and tolerant community. \n\nThe move comes amidst a wider global conversation about hate speech and the responsibility of artists and music labels towards shaping a tolerant and harmonious society.",
    "The leader of the Conservative Party, has unexpectedly stepped down from his legal position causing ripples in the political landscape. In a surprise move that flared up Westminster gossip, the Tory leader has made the decision to focus solely on his political obligations. \n\nThe announcement was made late Tuesday and was followed by an official resignation letter addressed to the Prime Minister. In the letter, he stated that he was relinquishing his legal role to concentrate fully on his duties as the head of the Conservative Party and to serve the British people.\n\nThe Conservative leader, whose legal and political professions seemingly overlapped, has maintained the position in a leading law firm for seven years along with his active role in politics. During this period of Edinburgh-trained lawyer quickly rose to prominence due to his sharp intelligence and strategic insight, are also qualities that have helped him to navigate the world of politics successfully.\n\nAlthough he has stepped down from his position, he made it clear that his years in the legal field have had a profound impact on his approach to politics, saying, \"While I have decided to step down from my position, the lessons I have learnt as a lawyer - the importance of evidence-based decision-making and fair representation - will continue to guide my work in politics.”\n\nWhile the reasons for his decision have not been made explicit, rumours suggest that his decision comes amidst growing concerns about possible conflicts of interest. There have been incidents in the past where his dual role as a leading lawyer and political figure has raised eyebrows. \n\nUpon his resignation, the Prime Minister expressed his gratitude for the services provided by the Tory leader saying, “You have always served diligently in both roles, but we also understand your decision to dedicate all your time to public service.”\n\nThe opposition has taken a different stance, expressing concerns over the timing of this decision and questioning whether there is more to his resignation. \n\nAs he leaves his legal career behind to focus entirely on his political duties, there is undoubtedly a critical task ahead for the Tory leader amidst the recent upheavals Britain is going through. His track record suggests he is a relentless, committed, and a pragmatic leader. However, the proof of his leadership mettle will lie in the way he leads the Conservative party in the approaching months.",
    "The Spanish press has been buzzing with reactions following the recent political and social events in the country. The media landscape, known for its diversity of opinions, has been filled with a range of responses, from support to criticism, reflecting the complexity of the current situation.\n\nLeading daily El Pais, known for its centre-left stance, has been vocal in its criticism of the government's handling of the economic crisis. In a scathing editorial, the newspaper accused the government of \"lacking a clear strategy\" and \"failing to provide a sense of direction for the country\". The paper also expressed concern over the rising unemployment rate, calling it a \"national emergency\".\n\nOn the other hand, right-leaning ABC has praised the government's efforts to stabilize the economy. The newspaper lauded the government's fiscal policies, arguing that they have \"prevented a complete economic collapse\". ABC also defended the government's handling of the recent social unrest, stating that it was \"necessary to maintain law and order\".\n\nMeanwhile, El Mundo, another major daily, has taken a more balanced approach. While acknowledging the government's efforts, it also pointed out the need for more comprehensive reforms. The paper argued that \"the government's actions, while commendable, are not enough to address the deep-rooted problems facing the country\".\n\nCatalan newspaper La Vanguardia focused on the regional implications of the recent events. It highlighted the growing discontent in Catalonia and called for a more inclusive approach to national politics. The paper argued that \"the government needs to listen to the voices of all regions, not just the capital\".\n\nIn the sports world, Marca and AS, the country's leading sports newspapers, have also weighed in on the situation. Both papers have expressed concern over the impact of the crisis on Spanish football, with Marca stating that \"the survival of many clubs is at stake\".\n\nOverall, the Spanish press has been actively engaging with the current events, providing a platform for diverse viewpoints. The reactions have been varied, reflecting the complexity of the situation and the challenges facing the country. As Spain navigates through these turbulent times, the role of the press in shaping public opinion and holding power to account remains crucial.",
    "A hospital in North Wales has been forced to temporarily halt a controversial plan that would prevent staff from speaking Welsh following widespread public criticism. The policy, aimed at the predominantly English-speaking patient population, sparked outrage among Welsh-speaking staff and citizens alike, leading to the suspension.\n\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, the body responsible for running the hospital, initially launched the scheme to ensure that all patients in their care understood the communications between health professionals. However, the initiative faced intense backlash, with critics arguing it was a direct attack on the Welsh language and culture.\n\nCritics launched a vigorous campaign against the policy, with thousands signing a petition to oppose it. The health board received an unprecedented level of complaints, further illuminating the depth of public dissatisfaction with the scheme.\n\nSian Gwenllian, the Arfon assembly member, described the policy as \"draconian\" and claimed that it undermined the Welsh language. She said, \"This is a very worrying move by the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which flies in the face of Welsh Government policies promoting the use of Welsh in everyday life.\"\n\nFollowing the sustained backlash, the health board has chosen to temporarily suspend the measure. They have recommitted to a more thorough review of their language policies, highlighting the inclusion of opinions from local communities into future procedures as a priority.\n\nFurther details about the length of suspension and what the future holds for the original policy remain unclear. However, the board committed itself to the protection and promotion of the Welsh language in its facilities.\n\nA spokesperson for the Health Board said, \"We recognise and value the significance of the Welsh language in our communities and our responsibility to promote it. We will continue to work with our staff and patients as well as the wider public as we review our policies.\"\n\nThis incident has reignited the debate about the role of the Welsh language in public services and its protection by law.

    "Brazil's government has sought to downplay the possibility of a state-led rescue for the country's struggling airline, Varig. The airline, which is currently grappling with a debt of over $3.3bn, has been seeking financial assistance to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nThe country's Vice President, Jose Alencar, who also serves as the Minister of Defence, stated that the government has no plans to bail out the beleaguered airline. \"The government is not thinking about this,\" he said. \"Varig needs to resolve its problems with its creditors.\"\n\nVarig, which is Brazil's largest airline, has been struggling with financial difficulties for several years. The company has been unable to pay its employees for several months and has also been forced to cancel numerous flights due to a lack of funds.\n\nThe airline's financial woes have been exacerbated by the global economic downturn and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the aviation industry. Despite this, the government has maintained that it is not the state's responsibility to rescue the airline.\n\n\"The government cannot take on the role of rescuing companies in difficulty,\" said Alencar. \"This is a matter for the private sector.\"\n\nThe government's stance has been met with criticism from Varig's employees and unions, who argue that the state has a responsibility to protect jobs and maintain vital services.\n\nDespite the government's refusal to intervene, Varig remains hopeful of finding a solution to its financial problems. The airline is reportedly in talks with several potential investors and is also considering a restructuring plan that would involve selling off some of its assets.\n\nHowever, with the airline's debts continuing to mount and no clear solution in sight, the future of Varig remains uncertain. The airline's struggles are indicative of the wider challenges facing Brazil's aviation industry, which has been hit hard by the economic fallout from the pandemic.",
    "A heated debate has erupted over proposals to grant Community Support Officers (CSOs) powers traditionally held by police officers. Critics argue that this move could blur the lines between professional policing and community support, potentially undermining the authority of the police.\n\nThe Home Office is considering plans to expand the remit of CSOs, who currently play a supporting role to the police, dealing with minor offences and providing a visible presence in communities. The proposed changes could see CSOs given powers to detain individuals and carry out searches, tasks usually reserved for fully trained police officers.\n\nSupporters of the proposal argue that it would free up police officers to deal with more serious crimes and could improve response times in communities. They also suggest that CSOs, who are often more embedded in their local communities, could use these powers to effectively tackle low-level crime.\n\nHowever, critics, including some senior police officers and politicians, have voiced concerns about the potential implications. They argue that policing requires specialist training and experience, which CSOs do not have. There are also concerns that the move could lead to a 'two-tier' policing system, with CSOs seen as a cheaper and less qualified alternative to police officers.\n\nThe Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents rank-and-file officers, has expressed its opposition to the proposal. Its chairman, John Apter, said: \"Policing is a highly skilled profession. The powers of a police officer are significant and far-reaching, and it is vital that they are exercised by those who have the appropriate training and accountability.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the National Association for Community Support Officers, which represents CSOs, has welcomed the proposal. Its spokesperson said: \"Our members are dedicated professionals who are deeply committed to their communities. This proposal recognises their valuable contribution and could help to make our communities even safer.\"\n\nThe Home Office has emphasised that no final decision has been made and that any changes would be subject to a full consultation. A spokesperson said: \"We are always looking for ways to support our police forces and make our communities safer. We believe that CSOs have a vital role to play, but it is important that any changes are carefully considered and based on evidence.\"\n\nThe debate comes at a time when police forces across the country are facing significant pressure due to budget cuts and rising crime rates. The proposal to expand the powers of CSOs is likely to continue to provoke strong reactions on both sides of the debate.",
    "Sony's latest handheld gaming device, the PlayStation Portable (PSP), is being hailed as a 'must-have' gadget by industry experts. \n\nThe PSP, originally launched in Japan last December, is a powerful and versatile handheld gaming device capable of running full-length movies, music, and high-quality games. Its sleek black design, large LCD screen, and impressive technical specifications have set the markets buzzing with excitement and anticipation.\n\nAsked why he considered the PSP a 'must-have', industry analyst John Peterson from ZK Research said, \"Sony has packed so much into this device it's hard to ignore. It's not just a gaming console, but a portable multimedia hub. With its ability to play music, movies and showcase photos in high-resolution, it's an ultimate device for digital entertainment.\" \n\n\"Battery life is good too, considering the power this handheld is packing. Sony has done a great job of balancing performance with power consumption,\" Peterson added.\n\nFurther enhancing the appeal of the PSP is its ability to connect wirelessly to the internet and other PSP devices. This allows for online gaming, web browsing, and data sharing, providing a truly connected portable experience.\n\nThe launch of the PSP comes at a time when the portable gaming market is booming. Sony's main competitor, Nintendo, has had considerable success with its DS handheld. However, analysts believe that the PSP's focus on multimedia and high-quality games might give it an edge.\n\nSales of the PSP in Japan have exceeded Sony’s expectations, with more than 500,000 units sold in the first two days of its release. There is an expectation that the European and American markets will respond similarly.\n\nHowever, despite all the praise, critics have pointed out a few potential issues with the PSP, including the high price tag and the proprietary UMD disk format used for games and movies, which limits the amount of available content. \n\nSony has responded by saying that they will be working with third-party developers to release a wide variety of games and movies in the UMD format. Hector Rodriguez, a spokesperson for Sony, stated that, \"The PSP is more than just a games device. It's a new way to experience entertainment, with endless opportunities for content and connectivity.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while the PSP's high cost and proprietary format may slow down its adoption rate initially, its varied capabilities and strong backing from Sony suggest that it truly could be the next 'must-have' gadget. Long term predictions are bullish, suggesting that the PSP could change the landscape of portable entertainment systems.",
    "International beverage behemoth, Global Breweries, has completed a significant acquisition of Izvestia Brews, a leading Russian beer company, in a major expansion of its global footprint.\n\nThe acquisition, announced this week, is Global Breweries' first foray into the lucrative, but challenging, Russian market. According to the deal, the beer conglomerate bought a controlling 51% stake of Izvestia Brews for an undisclosed amount.\n\n\"Izvestia Brews' strong brand, customer base and extensive distribution network provide the ideal entry point for us into the Russian market,” said Vincent McGuinness, CEO of Global Breweries.\n\nGlobal Breweries, known for its popular lagers and ales, has been on an international expansion tear over the past decade, snapping up local beer companies across Europe, Asia and the Americas. However, the Russian market has remained out of its grasp due to strict regulations, high local competition and a steep alcohol tax.\n\nIzvestia Brews, founded in Saint Petersburg in 1864, has long been a cornerstone of the Russian beer industry, maintaining a significant local market share in the country with its popular lager labels. Last year, Izvestia Brews recorded a $1.5bn turnover, with a net profit margin higher than the Russian industry average.\n\nDespite the challenges, Russia’s beer market offers enormous potential, as beer consumption is on the rise among the Russian population, particularly the youth. The country is also home to some of the world's biggest beer markets, including Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\nPatrick Jones, a London-based analyst at Beer Market Insights, said, \"This move is a clear sign that Global Breweries is ready to play in an even bigger league. They're not the first international beer company to covet the lucrative Russian market, but they are one of the few to have succeeded in securing a significant stake in a major domestic brand.\"\n\nWhile Global Breweries is looking to tap into this growth, it also plans to export Izvestia Brews' most popular beers to other markets. McGuinness said, \"We believe Izvestia's excellent brand of lagers will find new fans in our existing markets.\"\n\nThe deal, which is pending regulatory approval, is expected to be sealed by the end of this fiscal year. If approved, this takeover will mark one of the most substantial foreign investments in Russia’s beer industry to date.\n\nFor the millions of beer enthusiasts worldwide, the Global Breweries-Izvestia Brews alliance paves the way for a wider range of beer",
    "Former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger has categorically rejected the rumours swirling about the signing of a new goalkeeper. Amidst waves of speculations about potential changes in the team's dynamics, Wenger firmly put an end to anticipations about a new goalkeeper joining the ranks.\n\nWenger, who managed Arsenal for 22 years, was responding to rumours that the club is on the verge of signing a new goalkeeper to replace their current options. However, he stated that he is satisfied with the performance of the Arsenal's current duo – Bernd Leno and Runar Alex Runarsson.\n\n\"I believe in the ability and skills of our current goalkeepers. Bernd and Runar have been doing a commendable job between the sticks,\" Wenger told the BBC.\n\nThe North London club has had a shaky start to the Premiership season, prompting speculation about possible reinforcements during the winter transfer window. However, Wenger informed that he will maintain his faith in the goalkeeping department.\n\nLeno, who joined the Gunners in 2018 from Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen, has been largely consistent, while Runarsson, who arrived this summer from French club Dijon, is considered a promising talent.\n\nThe rumours of a new goalkeeper arose following Arsenal's inconsistent defensive performance this season. However, Wenger believes that such issues can be ironed out with fine-tuning, with no requirement for a new addition in the goalkeeping department.\n\nWenger’s ruling out of a new goalkeeper suggests he will instead focus on strengthening other aspects of the squad during the transfer window.\n\n\"We have a balanced team. Any shifts or changes need to be considered carefully to maintain that balance. As of now, there's no need for a new custodian,\" Wenger added.\n\nThe Frenchman’s comments are likely silencing speculations for now. Fans will be looking forward to seeing how the Gunners' performance evolves, with Wenger’s steadfast endorsement of the team's current goalkeepers.",
    "In a remarkable display of the growing value of virtual assets, an anonymous gamer has purchased a piece of virtual land for a staggering $26,500. The transaction took place in the blockchain-based virtual world, Decentraland, where users can buy, sell, and build upon digital plots of land.\n\nDecentraland operates on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to purchase plots, known as 'LAND', using the cryptocurrency MANA. Each plot is 16m x 16m, and the virtual world is divided into a grid of such plots. The $26,500 purchase equates to approximately 2.7 million MANA at current exchange rates.\n\nThe virtual world of Decentraland is a thriving digital economy where users can create and monetise content and applications. The platform has seen a surge in popularity over the past year, with increasing numbers of users investing in virtual real estate.\n\nThe anonymous buyer of the $26,500 plot has not yet revealed their plans for the land. However, in Decentraland, landowners have the freedom to develop their plots as they wish, from creating virtual businesses to building immersive experiences for other users.\n\nThis is not the first time that virtual land has sold for a high price in Decentraland. In 2020, a group of investors bought a plot for $80,000 with the intention of building a virtual shopping district.\n\nThe sale highlights the growing trend of investing in virtual goods and assets. As more people spend time in virtual worlds, the demand for digital real estate is increasing. This trend has been accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has seen people spending more time online and exploring virtual experiences.\n\nHowever, the market for virtual land is still relatively new and can be volatile. While some see it as a lucrative investment opportunity, others warn of the risks associated with investing in such a nascent market.\n\nDespite the risks, the sale of the $26,500 plot in Decentraland demonstrates the potential of virtual worlds as a new frontier for investment and commerce. As technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds are becoming increasingly blurred, opening up new opportunities for innovation and growth.",
    "The process of allocating and launching new internet domain names has taken significant strides forward, in a move that could transform the world's digital landscape.\n\nAccording to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the global authority responsible for managing online addresses, the roll-out of over 1000 new Top-level domain (TLD) names is set to commence in the forthcoming weeks.\n\nPreviously, there were only a limited number of generic TLD's, including traditional domain name options such as .com, .org and .net. Now, industries, companies, cities and even generic terms will be able to have their own personalised domain names such as .music, .apple, .london, .bank, .shop, making the internet's addressing system much more descriptive and user-friendly.\n\nICANN believes this move will remarkably expand the online real estate, providing companies with opportunities to create a more branded, targeted and innovative online presence. It could also potentially deliver more focused, easier-to-remember options for internet users around the globe.\n\nHowever, not everyone is elated about this radical change. Many cyber security experts have raised concerns about the potential for increased fraudulent activity. They suggest that cyber-criminals could leverage these new domain names to create more convincing phishing scams.\n\nReacting to these concerns, ICANN has stated that it has implemented robust protection measures, which includes the stipulation that all owners of the new domains run daily security checks. ICANN has also urged internet users to stay vigilant and to report any suspicious activity.\n\nWhile there's no doubt that this expansion brings remarkable opportunities, it also underscores the growing need for effective cyber security measures. Therefore, as we move to a more digital world with vast and varied domain names, users are advised to be cautious as they navigate this fresh digital terrain.\n\nICANN anticipates the impact of these new domains to be substantial, and that this could represent a major turning point in the evolution of the internet. With so many new domains to look forward to, the internet landscape is set to become more diverse, distinguished and perhaps slightly more complicated than ever before. Regardless of the challenges that might come our way, one thing is clear – the future of the internet is now.",
    "Apple has launched a groundbreaking legal request in an effort to force blogs to reveal their sources following a series of significant product leaks.\n\nThe technology giant has grown progressively more frustrated with continuous leaks about its products making headlines before the official releases. In an unprecedented move in the tech world, Apple has initiated legal proceedings against major blogs, directing them to disclose their veiled insider sources.\n\nThe company alleges that certain bloggers have been revealing classified information that lays out their design, features, and manufacturing process for future products. According to Apple, these leaks surpass the bounds of legitimate journalism and infringe on the firm's trade secret rights.\n\nApple's legal move has brought about apprehension within the blogging community, sparking concerns over press freedom. Critics argue that forcing the disclosure of sources could set a dangerous precedent that limits a free press, which is often hinged on confidential whistleblowers or insiders who unveil crucial information.\n\nThe scope of this case could extend beyond Apple and the tech industry. If the courts side with Apple, it could potentially affect all companies within industries that routinely deal with leaks.\n\n\"The question here is whether a blogger should be subject to the same legal expectations as a journalist,\" commented Prof. Solange Green, a law professor at the University of San Francisco focusing on freedom of speech. \"If the answer is 'yes', then it's likely we are going to see a seismic shift in the world of investigative blogging, regardless of the industry.\"\n\nDespite criticism regarding press freedom, Apple has pushed forward with its contention. Its chief legal officer stated that the company values the role of journalism in shedding light on important matters. However, he maintained that the act of exposing proprietary information is not journalistic activity but rather an illegal act that harms the company.\n\n\"Our goal is to ensure that classified information that supports our innovation is safe from being unfairly revealed,\" the officer explained. \"We respect the work of journalists, but when unscrupulous individuals masquerade as bloggers and expose confidential data, it affects not just our bottom line, but our collective intellectual property rights as well.\"\n\nThe lawsuit has been seen by many as indicative of how companies are striving to control information about their products amidst incessantly evolving digital spaces. The result of Apple's pursuit could well shape the future relationship between corporations, the press and bloggers across all sectors.",
    "Jose Mourinho, manager of Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, was once again at his confrontational best as he took a subtle dig at North London rivals, Arsenal, ahead of their clash next week. Always one to stir up controversy before a major game, Mourinho seems to thrive on the battle of wits, not just on, but also off the field.\n\nIn what seemed like an underhanded jab at Arsenal, Mourinho suggested that some teams are perpetually in a \"state of transition\" yet never make real progress. Although he didn’t directly mention Arsenal, football analysts were quick to deduce the clear reference to the Gunners, who have struggled for consistent form in recent times.\n\n\"Like a broken record, some teams seem to favour their prolonged transition periods. However, the question is, when does this transition end and the winning start? It's important to have plans but more important to have results,\" Mourinho stated at a press conference on Friday.\n\nThe Spurs manager also subtly criticised Arsenal's recruitment policy, hinting that focusing solely on young talent could be detrimental. While not shying away from praising the Gunners' individual players, he did question the club's longer-term vision.\n\nArsenal's fans were quick to react on social media, highlighting Spurs' own lack of silverware over the years. Some pointed out that it's a big gamble to play this mind game ahead of a critical North London derby.\n\nMourinho has a long history of sparring with several clubs and managers, with Arsenal being no exception. His most famous feud in England had been with former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, leading to a series of high-profile clashes over the years.\n\nThe upcoming North London derby, always a heated affair between the two fierce rivals, has now been spiced up even more thanks to Mourinho's comments. It remains to be seen if his mind games will pay dividends on the pitch or if they'll fire up an Arsenal side keen to prove him wrong.\n\nNevertheless, this much is clear - with Mourinho at the helm, Premier League football never ceases to entertain even off the pitch, and an epic North London derby is on the cards.",
    "The US economy has added more jobs than expected in the last month, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This positive trend indicates a rebound in the labor market, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Bureau reported that non-farm payrolls increased by 943,000 jobs in July, significantly higher than the 870,000 predicted by economists. This is the largest gain since last August and follows an upwardly revised 938,000 increase in June.\n\nThe unemployment rate also fell to 5.4% from 5.9% in June, the lowest since the pandemic began in March 2020. Economists had forecast the rate would fall to 5.7%.\n\nThe sectors that saw the most significant job growth were leisure and hospitality, education, and professional and business services. The leisure and hospitality sector alone added 380,000 jobs, reflecting the easing of pandemic restrictions and the return of domestic tourism.\n\nThe strong jobs report could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on when to start tapering its monthly bond purchases, a move that would signal the beginning of tighter monetary policy. The central bank has said it wants to see \"substantial further progress\" in the labor market before it begins to scale back its stimulus measures.\n\nHowever, despite the positive figures, there are still 5.7 million fewer jobs than there were before the pandemic. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age people who have a job or are looking for one, remained unchanged at 61.7%, well below the pre-pandemic level of 63.3%.\n\nThe data also showed a rise in wages, with average hourly earnings increasing by 11 cents to $30.54, suggesting companies are having to pay more to attract workers.\n\nWhile the jobs report is a positive sign for the US economy, experts warn that the recent surge in Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant could slow down the recovery. The impact of the variant on the labor market will be closely watched in the coming months.\n\nThe Biden administration welcomed the jobs report, but stressed that more work needs to be done to ensure a full economic recovery.

    "From smartwatches that monitor our heart rates to refrigerators that alert us when we're low on milk, technology today has become increasingly personal. It is permeating our daily routines, impacting how we work, communicate, shop, and even the way we manage our health.\n\nThe digital world is no longer confined to desktop computers or mobile gadgets with social media apps. The present and the foreseeable future belong to smart and connected devices - the Internet of Things (IoT) - with tech giants like Google and Apple orchestrating this revolution.\n\nOn our wrist, we have fitness trackers and smartwatches that count steps, measure heart rates, offer personalised workout sessions, and even detect signs of stress. Our phones are replete with apps that curate content based on our likes, dislikes, habits, and preferences. \n\nOur homes are becoming entirely connected entities, with smart speakers responding to voice commands, learning from our habits, and integrating with various other smart devices around the house. From security systems to thermostats and even appliances, these devices not only provide convenience, they learn from us, shaping themselves around our routines and preferences.\n\nIn the shopping realm, digital marketing strategies employ personalised advertising based on our browsing behaviour and purchase history. Companies digitally make sure that once we've searched for an item or similar items, we're re-targeted with advertisements for those goods.\n\nOn another front, health-focused technology has become a prominent feature in our lives. Innovative apps are turning mobile devices into medical devices, enabling remote patient monitoring and telehealth treatments. These tools collect crucial health data, analyse it and offer personalised health advice or alert healthcare providers for timely intervention.\n\nYet, as technology continues to get personal, it raises critical questions about data privacy and ethics. Consumers need to be aware of the vast amount of personal data they share with these devices and platforms, often unconsciously. Protecting this data becomes increasingly crucial as cyber threats continue to rise.\n\nAdvancements in privacy techniques, such as data anonymisation and encryption, promise to secure our data, but these are still reactive solutions. Simultaneously, there is an increasing call for policymakers to equip themselves with tech literacy to enact stringent regulations protecting user privacy.\n\nPersonal technology has opened the door to a new way of life that is convenient, efficient and unimaginable just a few decades ago.

    "Insurance giant Axa Sun Life has announced a significant reduction in bonus payments, a move that is expected to affect thousands of its policyholders. The company has attributed this decision to the challenging economic conditions and the low-interest-rate environment.\n\nThe firm, which is one of the UK's largest insurance providers, said that the annual bonus rates on some of its policies would be cut. The exact percentage of the reduction has not been disclosed, but it is expected to be a substantial decrease.\n\nAxa Sun Life's decision follows a trend among insurance companies, many of which have been reducing their bonus payments in recent years. This is largely due to the low-interest rates that have prevailed since the financial crisis of 2008, which have made it difficult for insurers to generate the returns they need to pay bonuses.\n\nThe company said in a statement: \"We understand that this decision may be disappointing for our policyholders. However, we believe it is a necessary step to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business. We remain committed to providing our customers with competitive returns on their investments.\"\n\nPolicyholders affected by the bonus cut will be notified by the company. The reduced bonus rates will apply to policies maturing or surrendering in the current year.\n\nThe move is likely to be met with disappointment by policyholders, many of whom rely on these bonuses as a form of income. However, industry experts have said that the decision is not surprising given the current economic climate.\n\nAxa Sun Life's announcement comes at a time when the insurance industry is under increasing pressure to maintain profitability in the face of low-interest rates and increased regulatory scrutiny. The company has said that it will continue to monitor the economic environment and make further adjustments as necessary.\n\nThe decision to cut bonus payments is a reminder of the challenges facing the insurance industry and the impact of economic conditions on companies' ability to deliver returns to policyholders. It also highlights the importance for consumers to carefully consider the potential returns on their investments and the risks associated with them.",
    "UK businesses are increasingly embracing e-commerce as part of their operations, according to new research. The shift can be attributed to rapidly changing consumer behaviours as well as the need to find alternative business channels in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe report indicates that nearly 85% of UK firms have moved towards online retailing as a primary part of their business model, while smaller enterprises and startups particularly taking advantage of the low-cost entry into e-commerce. \n\nData from the Office for National Statistics revealed that internet sales as a proportion of total retail sales jumped to 35.2% in January 2021, up from 19.5% in February 2020, indicating a significant shift in consumer shopping habits. \n\nThe impact of the pandemic on UK businesses had been instrumental in accelerating the shift towards online retailing. As face-to-face commerce was restricted by lockdown measures, businesses – from groceries to clothing retailers – turned to e-commerce to maintain sales and stay afloat. \n\nThe advantages of the online business model, including the ability to serve customers round-the-clock and explore international markets without the need of a physical presence, are reportedly appealing to a greater number of SMEs (small to medium-sized enterprises).\n\nAccording to tech analyst, Jamie Colley, this trend is here to stay. \"Businesses have realised that e-commerce not only offers an effective crisis response but also a long-term revenue stream. What we're seeing is a digital revolution led by necessity,\" he said. \n\nThe UK government has also played a significant role in supporting this transition, with various programs like 'Help to Grow' which aid companies in developing their digital skills.\n\nHowever, the switch to virtual retail also comes with its challenges, such as data protection and cybersecurity threats. Businesses have been urged to pay extra attention to online security measures and ensure robust digital infrastructure is in place.\n\n\"The rapid rise of e-commerce isn't just a testament to the power of technology. It's also a testament to the resilience and adaptability of countless of UK firms who, when faced with a unprecedented global pandemic, have made a swift and successful move to the digital marketplace.\" Mr. Colley added. \n\nAs UK's high streets prepare to reopen, this blend of physical and digital commerce, or 'phygital' as it's being called, is set to redefine the business landscape in the country, creating opportunities and challenges in equal measure.",
    "England's football team is facing an escalating defensive crisis as key defenders continue to struggle with injuries and suspicesions. With crucial matches on the horizon, this raises alarm about the team's capacity to withstand the threat posed by fierce competitors.\n\nCenter-backs Harry Maguire and John Stones, known for their robust presence on the field and ability to thwart opposing advances, both face uncertain injury situations. Maguire's fitness has been in question since he sustained an ankle injury playing for Manchester United, while Stones suffered a muscle injury during training.\n\nMeanwhile, right-back Kyle Walker is one step away from suspension after picking up yellow cards in two consecutive games. The player's aggressive style, though often effective, runs the risk of leaving the team a man down in future matches. Furthermore, left-back Luke Shaw was sent home early from training due to illness, casting doubt over his availability ahead of crucial fixtures.\n\nThis string of unfortunate circumstances leaves England with a depleted defensive line. As alternatives, manager Gareth Southgate could delve into the inexperienced talents in the squad, like Tyrone Mings or Ben White. However, neither have the wealth of experience playing at high-stake international games that the likes of Maguire, Stones, and Walker can boast.\n\nSouthgate remains hopeful, stating in a recent press conference: \"It's always a challenge dealing with injuries and suspensions. However, we have a strong squad and fully believe in the ability of each player.\"\n\nDespite this optimism, there is no denying that the defensive crisis poses a significant challenge for England. With the European championship and World Cup qualifiers coming up, the team needs its defensive stalwarts not only fit but also in prime form to ensure a successful campaign.\n\nOnly time will tell how England navigates this situation.

The former world number eight, who has struggled with knee problems throughout his career, said he is unsure if he will be fit enough to compete in the first Grand Slam of the year.\n\nPhilippoussis, 44, has been plagued by injuries in recent years, with multiple surgeries on his right knee. Despite his determination to return to the court, the Melbourne-born player admitted that his recovery has been slower than expected.\n\n\"I've been working hard on my fitness and rehabilitation, but it's been a tough journey,\" Philippoussis said. \"I'm not sure if I'll be ready in time for the Australian Open. It's frustrating, but my health has to come first.\"\n\nThe Australian Open, which is set to begin in January, would mark Philippoussis' first major tournament since he retired from professional tennis in 2015. His potential absence would be a significant blow to the tournament, which has already seen a number of high-profile withdrawals due to injury and COVID-19 concerns.\n\nPhilippoussis, known for his powerful serve and aggressive play, reached the finals of the US Open in 1998 and Wimbledon in 2003. However, his career has been marred by injuries, with seven knee surgeries forcing him to take extended breaks from the sport.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, Philippoussis remains hopeful of making a comeback. \"I'm doing everything I can to get back on the court,\" he said. \"I love this sport and I'm not ready to give up on it yet.\"\n\nThe Australian Open organisers have yet to comment on Philippoussis' potential withdrawal.

    "The emerging trend towards the aesthetic and aural aspects of mobile devices is astonishing, showing that consumers are no longer interested in just making calls. Upcoming mobile devices will be driven by design aesthetics like colour, style, size, and music, according to industry analysts. In fact, they believe that music will play a vital role in the growth of the mobile market in the next few years.\n\nMarket experts have predicted a significant shift in the mobile market, as consumers now view mobile phones not just as communication tools but as fashion accessories and entertainment devices. The increase in sales of mobiles with MP3 players and radio tuners supports this statement.\n\nThe aesthetics of phones have become more and more important, with consumers looking at colour options, shapes, and sizes before purchasing. Manufacturers are investing in research and design to produce phones with novel looks and features that can attract consumers.\n\nMusic on the other hand has grown significantly on mobile devices. Phones have become the modern equivalent of the Walkman, allowing people to listen to music on the go. Mobiles now come with massive storage options enabling users to store and play thousands of songs. Additionally, music streaming services like Spotify are integrating their services into the mobile platform, allowing a seamless experience for music lovers.\n\nThe boom in music on mobiles is not only beneficial for consumers but is also driving profits for mobile companies. Mobile firms and music labels are entering into profitable partnerships allowing users to download songs directly into their mobiles.\n\nThe trend is global, with mobile phones now seen as personal items reflecting the user's taste, style and even personality. It's not uncommon to see people using their phones to play music out loud in public places.\n\nManufacturers are responding to these trends by producing mobiles with better screens, excellent audio quality, stylish designs, and more music-focused features. They are also investing in marketing campaigns that emphasise these features.\n\nSome well-known examples include Samsung collaborating with artists for special edition phones while Apple radically changed the market with the introduction of the iPod and later the iPhone. Many companies are following the same path, resulting in a blend of technology, music, and style.\n\nWhile these features may not be the sole deciding factors for consumers buying a new mobile, they undoubtedly play a vital role. As technology continues to evolve, we might soon be witnessing a world where mobile phones will be as much about design and music as they are about communication.\n\nIn conclusion, it's not just about making calls anymore.

    "Egypt and Israel have reached a historic trade agreement, marking a significant step forward in the economic relations between the two Middle Eastern nations. The deal, which was announced on Monday, is expected to boost bilateral trade and investment, and further strengthen the ties between the two countries.\n\nThe agreement was signed in Cairo by Egypt's Minister of Trade and Industry, Nevin Gamea, and her Israeli counterpart, Orna Barbivai. The signing ceremony was attended by high-ranking officials from both countries, including Egypt's Prime Minister, Mostafa Madbouly, and Israel's Economy Minister, Eli Cohen.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, both countries will eliminate tariffs on a wide range of goods and services, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders. The deal also includes provisions to protect investments and intellectual property rights, and to resolve trade disputes through arbitration.\n\n\"This agreement is a milestone in the economic relations between Egypt and Israel,\" said Gamea. \"It will open up new opportunities for businesses in both countries, and contribute to the economic development of the region.\"\n\nBarbivai echoed these sentiments, stating, \"This deal is not just about trade, it's about building a stronger, more prosperous future for our two nations. It's a testament to the progress we've made in our relations, and a sign of the potential that lies ahead.\"\n\nThe trade deal comes amid a warming of relations between Egypt and Israel, which have been marked by decades of tension and conflict. The two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979, but economic ties have remained relatively limited.\n\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in the dynamics of the relationship. The two nations have cooperated on a range of issues, including energy, security, and counter-terrorism. The trade deal is seen as a further indication of this growing cooperation.\n\nThe agreement is expected to be ratified by the parliaments of both countries in the coming months. Once ratified, it will be the most comprehensive trade agreement between the two nations to date.\n\nThe deal has been welcomed by business leaders in both countries, who see it as a significant opportunity to expand their markets and increase their competitiveness. It is also expected to create jobs and stimulate economic growth in both Egypt and Israel.\n\nThe trade deal is also likely to have wider implications for the region. It could potentially pave the way for similar agreements between Israel and other Arab nations, and contribute to the normalization of economic relations in the Middle East.",
    "The Venezuelan government has recently conducted an inventory of farm lands throughout the country, and has identified several farms that are not being cultivated or utilised to their full potential. This move is part of President Nicolas Maduro's plan to boost agricultural productivity, as the country faces a critical shortage of food and a spiralling economic crisis.\n\nThis has been the latest attempt by the Venezuelan government to tackle the acute shortage of basic goods, which has fuelled inflation and caused widespread frustration and unrest within the country. The country's government blames these shortages on speculative hoarding and US sanctions.\n\nThe identified 'idle' farms are expected to be repurposed for optimized production. For now, though, the government hasn't detailed its plans for these farms. This has led to some concerns that farmland could be expropriated from private owners, as was done under the rule of former president Hugo Chavez. \n\nThe country is currently in the midst of an economic downturn, largely caused by the fall in global oil prices. Venezuela, known for being among the world's largest oil producers, has been hit particularly hard. This has put immense pressure on the government to find alternative solutions to alleviate the crisis.\n\nThe move to identify idle farms is seen by some as an attempt to shift the country's economy from heavily relying on oil, towards a more diversified structure that includes agriculture. \n\nHowever, experts have voiced concerns over what the identification and potential repurposing of these farms may mean for private property rights in the country.\n\nAnalysts argue that the government's strategy will need to be combined with other measures, such as tackling inflation, stimulating foreign investment, and creating favourable conditions for local production, in order to effectively confront the ongoing economic crisis. \n\nThe 'idle' farm phenomenon is not unique to Venezuela. Several other countries with agricultural potential also face underutilisation of arable land. However, given the severe crisis Venezuela is currently grappling with, the issue is especially pressing. \n\nWhile the identification of idle farms could provide a potential solution to the food crisis in the country, it also highlights the fact that sustainable solutions are needed to address Venezuela’s economic and political challenges. \n\nThe authorities plan to continue to survey farmland across the country into next year. But as both the agricultural sector and general economic conditions continue to struggle, many Venezuelans are unsure of what the future holds.",
    "Rangers emerged victorious in the much-anticipated Old Firm derby, reinforcing a resolute grip on the Scottish Premiership. They underlined their title credentials by outclassing arch-rivals Celtic in a thrilling clash at Ibrox.\n\nIt was the Gers who dominated the game from the start, pressing high and pushing Celtic back with slick movements and intricate passages of play. They carved open the Celtic defence time and again with remarkable ease. \n\nManager Steven Gerrard had stressed the importance of this clash in the build up to the game and hailed his team's commitment and impressive performance, calling it an \"incredibly important\" victory.\n\nIn front of a fervent home crowd, Rangers took the lead midway through the first half when Joe Aribo's clever finish found the back of the net. This was soon followed by another brilliant goal from marauding full-back James Tavernier before the interval.\n\nCeltic came into the game more in the second half, but despite their best efforts, they struggled to break down a disciplined Rangers defence. The Blues remained calm and resolute, defending as a unit and denying space to the Celtic forwards.\n\nEven when Celtic managed to pull a goal back, courtesy of a David Turnbull strike, Rangers refused to panic. They instead pressed on for another goal, a move that killed off the game when Alfredo Morelos slotted one into the corner.\n\nWith full-time whistle, it was clear that Rangers had turned the tables on their arch-rivals and ignited a new chapter in the Old Firm history. This win, a first in three meetings for Gerrard's side, takes them seven points clear at the top of the Premiership.\n\nThe elation was evident amidst the Rangers camp. Gerrard said: \"We knew what was at stake today. The players showed up and delivered exactly what was asked of them\".\n\nCeltic’s manager, meanwhile, was left with plenty of soul-searching. They’ll need to come up with a new plan to regain their lost ground in the title race. As for Rangers, this victory isn't just three points, it's a statement of intent that they are here to challenge for the title. \n\nThe Old Firm derby always carries significant weight in Scottish Football and with this victory, Rangers have surely delivered a psychological blow to their rivals. But as always, there's still a long season ahead. The endurance, consistency and determination shown by both teams will determine who lifts the Scottish Premiership trophy.",
    "Former Liverpool and Wales striker, Ian Rush, future at Chester City remains uncertain as discussions regarding his position as the club's manager continue.\n\nRush, who was appointed manager of the financially embattled club in August 2004, has led Chester to a mid-table position in League Two this season. However, in recent weeks, there have been growing concerns about the club's fiscal health and Rush's strategies have been under scrutiny.\n\nChester City Chairman, Stephen Vaughan, said in a statement that the club is considering several options, but no final decision has been made regarding Rush's future at the club. \"We are in a challenging period, financially and competitively. We are thinking about everything that can help the club. Rushy has been great for us but we have to consider all options. No decision has yet been made,\" Vaughan explained.\n\nUnder Rush, Chester has experienced a series of ups and downs. The team's inconsistent performance in recent games, coupled with problems off the field, has fuelled speculation about his future at the club.\n\nRush was initially viewed as a bold choice to lead Chester City. His reputation as Liverpool’s all-time leading scorer and an icon of Welsh football added weight to his appointment. However, his lack of previous managerial experience has come under fire as the club struggles to rise in the ranks. \n\nThe former Liverpool great has had to operate under severe budget constraint, that has limited his ability to bring in new players. Rush, however, has remained stoic amidst the pressure. \"Football is a results business. All I can do is the best I can with the resources I have. The future is not in my hands,\" Rush said, responding to the speculation about his job.\n\nRush has one year remaining on his three-year contract with the club. \n\nFans of the club are split about Rush's tenure with some appreciating his efforts given the financial constraints, whereas others feel a change in leadership could be beneficial. \n\nThe club says further announcements regarding Rush's future and the overall management structure will be made in due course as the end of the season approaches.",
    "When OutKast emerged out of Atlanta in the 90s with their innovative style blending different genres of music like hip-hop, funk, and soul, they created a storm in the music industry that is still felt today. Nearly two decades after their most acclaimed album, \"Stankonia,\" was released, the question remains: will OutKast's influence continue to reverberate, and more pertinently can they ever be followed?\n\nAndre '3000' Benjamin and Antwan ‘Big Boi’ Patton came together to form OutKast, and they immediately stood out due to their trademark mix of unique beats and experimental style. OutKast broke boundaries, spoke about social issues, and created music that would defy the typical constraints of mainstream hip hop.\n\nTheir 2003 double album \"Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\" took the world by storm, landing them Album of the Year at the 46th Grammy Awards. This mammoth release included the smash hit 'Hey Ya!', a song that would become emblematic of the group's eclectic sound.\n\nBut since their groundbreaking album, OutKast has gone quiet, with both members exploring other ventures. André 3000 acted in films and released fashion lines, while Big Boi went on to release three solo albums.\n\nThe absence of new music from OutKast has surely left a void in the music world as preciously few have been able to encapsulate that same sense of defiance, creativity, and raw talent. But while the spotlight has moved to other artists, OutKast's influence remains.\n\nModern artists like Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino have been compared to OutKast, continuing the exploration of social issues through innovative music, pushing boundaries, and not being afraid to defy expectations of their genre. Even so, they each bring their unique qualities to the table, underlining how difficult it is to replicate the magic of OutKast.\n\nWhile OutKast might not be releasing new music, their lasting legacy is apparent. The music industry continues to feel the aftershocks of the seismic shift they initiated. There is a palpable anticipation among fans, and an unsaid expectation amongst artists, for a comeback from this iconic duo.\n\nAndre '3000' Benjamin and Antwan ‘Big Boi’ Patton changed the game with OutKast, and whether they return to music or not, their influence will continue to reverberate through the industry. A 'hard act to follow' may often seem like a cliché phraseology, but in the case of OutK",
    "Swiss tennis titan, Roger Federer, was pushed to the limits in his most recent match at the prestigious Grand Slam. Displaying his trademark tenacity, Federer displayed why he’s considered one of the all-time greats in tennis, as he survived a five-set thriller to progress to the next round.\n\nFederer, a 20-time Grand Slam champion, was on the brink of exiting early from the tournament against a determined adversary. Yet the Swiss star summoned all his experience and skill, staving off defeat in the face of extreme pressure.\n\nThroughout the game, Federer struggled to find his usual rhythm against his opponent's powerful return game and precision passing shots. The underdog frequently had Federer on the backfoot, breaking his service game multiple times and forcing him to fight from behind.\n\nHowever, the Swiss maestro, never one to shy away from a challenge, later credited his opponent’s performance. \"He was incredible, he played some really fantastic tennis. I had to dig deep to find a way to win,\" Federer admitted in a post-match interview.\n\nIn the decisive fifth set, Federer dug deep, showcasing the relentless resilience and steely determination that has seen him rise to the peak of tennis.

    "The UK Independence Party (UKIP) has suspended one of its candidates following allegations of misconduct. The party confirmed the suspension but did not disclose the identity of the candidate or the nature of the alleged misconduct.\n\nA spokesperson for UKIP said, \"We can confirm that a candidate has been suspended pending an investigation. As a party, we take all allegations of misconduct very seriously. We will not be making any further comment until the investigation is complete.\"\n\nThe suspension comes at a critical time for UKIP, which has been struggling to maintain its relevance in the UK political landscape. The party, which played a significant role in the Brexit campaign, has seen a decline in its support base since the 2016 EU referendum.\n\nThe suspension could potentially impact the party's performance in the upcoming local elections. UKIP, once a significant force in British politics, has been grappling with internal divisions and a series of leadership changes in recent years.\n\nThe party's current leader, Neil Hamilton, has pledged to restore UKIP's fortunes and make it a \"credible force\" in British politics again. However, this latest incident is likely to pose a further challenge to his leadership.\n\nThe suspended candidate was due to stand in the local elections scheduled for May. It is unclear whether the party will be able to field a replacement candidate in time.\n\nThe suspension also raises questions about the party's vetting process for candidates. Critics argue that UKIP needs to do more to ensure that its candidates are fit for public office.\n\nUKIP has faced criticism in the past for the behaviour of some of its members. In 2018, the party was forced to distance itself from one of its candidates who made controversial comments about Islam.\n\nThe party has yet to comment on the potential impact of the suspension on its election campaign. However, political analysts suggest that it could further damage the party's image and electoral prospects.\n\nThe investigation into the allegations against the suspended candidate is ongoing.",
    "UK Coal, the country's largest coal producer, has reported a significant increase in its annual losses, raising concerns about the future of the struggling industry. \n\nThe company reported a pre-tax loss of £143m for the year ending December 2021, compared to a loss of £83m in the previous year. This marks a 72% increase in losses, reflecting the ongoing challenges faced by the coal industry amid declining demand and increasing environmental regulations.\n\nUK Coal's revenues also fell by 20% to £120m, down from £150m in 2020. The company attributed the decline to a combination of lower coal prices and reduced production levels. The company's coal production fell by 15% to 2.5 million tonnes, down from 2.9 million tonnes in the previous year.\n\nThe company's deepening financial woes come at a time when the UK government is seeking to phase out coal power by 2024 as part of its commitment to reduce carbon emissions. The move has put additional pressure on UK Coal and other coal producers, who are grappling with the dual challenges of falling demand and the need to transition to cleaner forms of energy.\n\nUK Coal's Chief Executive, John Smith, said the company was facing \"unprecedented challenges\". He added: \"The market conditions are tough, and the regulatory environment is becoming increasingly difficult. We are doing everything we can to navigate through these challenges and secure the future of the business.\"\n\nDespite the bleak outlook, Mr Smith said the company was exploring various options to improve its financial position, including potential asset sales and cost-cutting measures. He also highlighted the company's efforts to diversify its business by investing in renewable energy projects.\n\nHowever, industry analysts warn that the company's survival is far from certain. \"UK Coal is in a precarious position,\" said James Leonard, an energy analyst at Investec. \"The company's financial health is deteriorating, and it's unclear whether it can successfully transition to a post-coal future.\"\n\nThe UK's coal industry has been in decline for several decades, with many mines closing and thousands of jobs lost. The industry's decline has been accelerated by the UK government's commitment to reduce carbon emissions and the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy sources.\n\nUK Coal's latest financial results highlight the ongoing challenges faced by the coal industry and raise questions about the future of coal mining in the UK.",
    "The devastating tsunami that struck Sri Lanka in December 2004 is estimated to cost the country approximately $1.3bn, according to government officials. This figure includes the cost of rebuilding infrastructure, homes, and businesses, as well as the economic impact of lost tourism and trade.\n\nThe tsunami, triggered by a massive undersea earthquake off the coast of Indonesia, claimed the lives of over 30,000 people in Sri Lanka and left more than half a million homeless. The disaster also caused significant damage to the country's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and power lines.\n\nThe Sri Lankan government has been working closely with international aid agencies and foreign governments to assess the full extent of the damage and to coordinate relief efforts. However, the scale of the disaster has presented significant challenges.\n\n\"The cost of rebuilding is enormous,\" said a government spokesperson. \"We are doing everything we can to ensure that the funds are used effectively and efficiently, but the task is monumental.\"\n\nThe tourism industry, a major source of income for Sri Lanka, has been particularly hard hit. Many of the country's popular beach resorts were destroyed or severely damaged by the tsunami. The government estimates that it will take several years for the industry to fully recover.\n\nIn addition to the physical damage, the tsunami has also had a significant impact on the country's economy. Many businesses were destroyed or forced to close, resulting in job losses and a decrease in economic activity. The government is working to provide financial support to affected businesses and to stimulate economic recovery.\n\nThe international community has pledged significant financial aid to help Sri Lanka recover from the disaster. However, the government has stressed that the process of rebuilding will be a long-term effort, requiring sustained support.\n\n\"The generosity of the international community has been overwhelming,\" said the spokesperson. \"But the road to recovery is long. We will need continued support in the months and years to come.\"\n\nThe government has also called for greater investment in disaster risk reduction and preparedness, to help mitigate the impact of future natural disasters.\n\nThe $1.3bn figure is an initial estimate and could rise as the full extent of the damage becomes clear. The government is committed to ensuring that every dollar is used effectively to help the people of Sri Lanka recover and rebuild.",
    "Tens of thousands of students across Wales are being significantly affected as sweeping funding cuts hit their institutions. University and course budget reductions are causing concerns about the effect on the quality of education and student support services.\n\nThe Welsh Government's decision to reduce higher education funding by 35% over two years has been criticised by students and academics alike. The budget trimmed from £129m to £83m, is expected to severely impact the support to students and faculties.\n\nUniversities Wales, an organisation that represents the interests of universities in Wales, explained that these funding cuts will inevitably lead to a drop in the quality of education as well as student services. They warn that the cuts could undermine the competitiveness of Welsh universities both at home and abroad.\n\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by the National Union of Students (NUS) Wales, over 80% of students in Wales are concerned about the potential impact of these cuts on their education. The study revealed anxieties about larger class sizes, reduced contact hours and fewer resources being available.\n\nGwyneth Sweatman, President of NUS Wales, has voiced her disappointment at the government’s decision. “This is an unequivocal blow to students across Wales. At a time when they are already facing financial, mental health, and housing issues, this financial blow could disrupt their preparations and studies,” she said. She also reinforced that the choice of the government was contradicted by its own goal of widening access to higher education and improving social mobility.\n\nCritics warn that the ripple effect of these cuts may be extensive, resulting in reduced employability of Welsh students and decreasing student satisfaction ratings at Welsh universities. The Department for Education has however insisted that the Welsh HE sector remains sustainable and dynamic in the long term.\n\nUniversities Wales said in a statement: \"We are currently working with our universities to ensure the financial sustainability and quality of higher education in Wales, as well as to help them plan for the impact of further funding cuts.\"\n\nWelsh Universities are expected to face these cuts in the upcoming academic year whilst students are expressing their concerns about their ability to continue their education under these new financial constraints.\n\nAs of yet, the government has not made any indication of plans to reverse or mitigate the funding cuts. The Welsh Government suggested that universities should focus on increasing revenue through other means, such as increasing international student enrolment and improving enterprise and innovation relationships.\n",
    "The Kenyan Athletics Federation (KAF) has lifted the suspension of long-distance runner Susan Chepkemei, paving the way for her to return to international competition.\n\nAccording to a KAF statement, Chepkemei, a renowned athlete specialising in cross country and marathon racing, has been permitted to resume her athletic career. The federation did not provide the reasons behind the lifting of the suspension but confirmed that Chepkemei was no longer banned.\n\nThe 35-year-old athlete was handed an indefinite suspension by the KAF in 2007. This followed a series of disciplinary issues including her failure to report to a training camp before a major international competition.\n  \nDespite the challenges, Chepkemei has a distinguished career both locally and internationally. She has won a slew of medals, including a silver medal at the 2004 New York City Marathon and a second place in the 2005 London Marathon.\n\nChepkemei’s suspension lifting has been received warmly by fellow athletes and sports enthusiasts in Kenya. They hope this will inspire the accomplished sportswoman to recommence her athletic ventures and continue to make the country proud.\n\nAs for Chepkemei herself, this decision allows her to return to the sport she loves and give her another chance at representing Kenya at a world stage. It's unquestionable that her return to competitive marathons will be eagerly awaited.\n\nDespite various high-profile doping incidents involving Kenyan athletes, Chepkemei's lifting of suspension is a testimony that KAF is indeed committed to nurturing and promoting the country's athletics prowess.\n\nThe lifting of Chepkemei's suspension comes as a boon to Kenyan athletics, which boasts a rich history of successful long-distance runners. This move has the potential to further boost the morale of Kenyan athletes, as they continue to display their mettle on the international arena. \n\nThe reintroduction of Chepkemei to international athletic competitions is sure to be watched keenly by sports followers worldwide, and her future performances will certainly be of great interest.",
    "Two of America's biggest car manufacturers, General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor Co, have announced a cut in output, as sales of cars in the United States begin to falter amid fading consumer demand and a global microchip shortage.\n\nGeneral Motors said it expects to reduce production at several North American plants for various weeks until the end of year due to the ongoing semiconductor crisis that has disrupted global automotive industry unabatedly. The company cited that it's expecting to take a $2 billion hit to earnings due to the reduction in output.\n\nFord, on the other hand, confirmed the suspension of the production shift at the Kansas City assembly plant affecting the Transit Van and F-150 pickup truck models.   Additionally, it will also close its Ohio assembly plant which produces medium-duty trucks for two weeks. \n\nBoth automakers expressed hope for demand recovery but acknowledged the ongoing difficulties.\n\nThe impact of the global chip shortage, coupled with weakened consumer demand amid the ongoing pandemic, has escalated the challenges facing the American auto industry. The supply chain disruption has left car companies struggling to meet demand, impacting both their top and bottom lines.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association reported last month that the global semiconductor shortage is unlikely to resolve before 2023. The organisation also stated that more than $110 billion in sales could be lost globally this year due to the semiconductor shortage.\n\n\"The situation remains fluid,\" Ford's Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said in a statement. \"We are doing everything we can to minimize the disruption to our customers.\"\n\nWhile GM and Ford grapple to keep production rolling, the consequences of decreased manufacturing could have a sizeable impact on the broader US economy. Decreased vehicle production inevitably raises the cost of vehicles, potentially dampening the demand even more.\n\nAnalysts are now warning that continuous disrupted supplies could impact jobs as automakers can’t keep workers in factories churning out vehicles if they don't have the necessary parts. \n\nRipples are being felt beyond the auto sector. The reduction in production will affect hundreds of car part suppliers, potentially forcing worker layoffs or furloughs in those companies.\n\nThe US car manufacturing industry is unlikely to see any respite any time soon. As such, GM and Ford's decision to reduce output signals a potential new phase in the industry's response to an unprecedented combination of factors impacting production and overall sales.",
    "Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has agreed to a $25bn deal to acquire Guidant Corporation, a leading manufacturer of cardiovascular medical products. The deal is set to significantly expand J&J's presence in the medical devices market.\n\nThe acquisition, which is one of the largest in the healthcare sector, will see J&J take control of Guidant's extensive portfolio of pacemakers, defibrillators, and other cardiovascular devices. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of the year, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nJ&J's Chief Executive, Alex Gorsky, said the acquisition would \"significantly strengthen\" the company's position in the global medical devices market. \"This acquisition is a strategic fit that will allow us to leverage our scale and expertise to drive growth,\" he said.\n\nGuidant, based in Indianapolis, is a world leader in the development of cardiovascular medical products. The company's devices are used by millions of patients worldwide.\n\nThe deal comes as J&J seeks to diversify its business beyond pharmaceuticals. The company has been investing heavily in its medical devices and diagnostics division, which accounted for nearly 40% of its total revenue last year.\n\nThe acquisition of Guidant is expected to provide a significant boost to this division. Analysts predict that the deal could add as much as $5bn to J&J's annual sales.\n\nHowever, the deal is not without risks. Guidant has been grappling with product recalls and lawsuits related to its defibrillators. J&J said it had factored these issues into its calculations and was confident it could manage them.\n\nThe acquisition is subject to approval by Guidant's shareholders and regulatory authorities. If approved, it will be the largest deal in J&J's 130-year history.",
    "The Labour Party has announced a new initiative aimed at tackling the issue of 'hardcore truants' - students who persistently miss school without a valid reason. The party believes that this issue is a significant factor in the underachievement of some students and is committed to addressing it.\n\nShadow Education Secretary, Kate Green, stated that the party's new policy would focus on providing support to families and schools to help ensure children attend school regularly. She also highlighted the importance of addressing the underlying issues that often lead to truancy, such as poverty, mental health problems, and family difficulties.\n\n\"Persistent absence from school can have a devastating impact on a child's education and future prospects,\" Green said. \"We need to do more to support families and schools to tackle this issue. This isn't about punishing parents, but about providing the help and support they need to get their children to school.\"\n\nThe Labour Party's initiative comes in response to recent statistics from the Department for Education, which revealed that around 300,000 students in England missed at least half a day of school each week in the 2018-2019 academic year. The figures also showed that children eligible for free school meals were more than twice as likely to be persistent absentees.\n\nUnder the new policy, Labour proposes to invest in early intervention services and provide more resources for schools to work with families and local agencies. The party also plans to review the current system of fines for parents whose children miss school without a valid reason, arguing that it often penalises those who are already struggling financially.\n\nThe initiative has been welcomed by several education charities and organisations. However, some critics argue that the focus should be on making school more engaging for students, rather than penalising parents.\n\nThe Conservative Party has responded to Labour's proposal by stating that they have already invested millions in programmes to reduce persistent absence and support disadvantaged students. They also defended the current system of fines, arguing that it is a necessary deterrent for parents who do not ensure their children's regular attendance at school.\n\nLabour's new policy on truancy is expected to be a key part of their education manifesto in the run-up to the next general election.",
    "As tighter restrictions and penalties continue to challenge online file-sharing platforms, an international consortium of programmers and enthusiasts known as \"The Swarm\" is preparing to launch a new peer-to-peer (P2P) network. This network promises to be more robust, decentralised, and impossible to shut down.\n\nThe proposed P2P network will utilise advanced routing protocols and SIP-based (Session Initiation Protocol) content delivery to share files. This network is designed to resist actions from regulatory authorities by being decentralised, meaning there is no central control or single point of failure that can be targeted to dismantle it. \n\n\"The Swarm\" claims that the new network will function in a similar fashion to the Internet, with web traffic being routed through a multitude of paths, providing an essential level of redundancy and resiliency. This feature marks a significant departure from traditional P2P networks, which rely on centralised servers and are thus susceptible to legal action.\n\nThe development of this new network comes in response to increasing crackdowns on file-sharing platforms such as Napster, LimeWire, and Pirate Bay. These platforms have been the target of numerous lawsuits from music and film industry bodies seeking to stop the unauthorised distribution of copyrighted material. \n\nWhile the new network is likely to be greeted with enthusiasm by the millions of Internet users who regularly use such platforms to exchange files, it is also certain to raise concerns amongst those who enforce copyright laws.\n\n\"The Swarm\" has yet to announce an official launch date for the new network. However, they caution prospective users that it is not a 'Get Out of Jail Free card' and those sharing copyrighted content could still face legal consequences under existing legislation.\n\nRegardless of the controversies surrounding file-swapping, the move towards more resilient and decentralised networks evidences an ongoing trend in digital technology. Recently, decentralisation has become a prime consideration, even in social media platforms, as users seek more control over their data and digital lives.\n\nGiven these recent evolutions, the world is closely watching to see what the new network by \"The Swarm\" will bring to the already dynamic landscape of digital file-sharing. The ability to have a resilient and untargeted file-swapping network could indeed revolutionise the way online users share and access files.",
    "The head of the United States cybersecurity agency, who has been pivotal in raising the nation's defenses against cyber attacks, has resigned from his position. The details regarding the reasons for the decision remain unclear.\n\nThe official, who has yet to be named publicly, led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The CISA has been instrumental in spearheading national efforts to guard against cyber threats and enhance cybersecurity.\n\nUnder the official's direction, the agency has faced major challenges, from combating disinformation about the electoral process to confronting increasing cyber espionage from foreign adversaries. The agency has also been at the forefront of the country's response to the COVID-19 crisis, defending against digital threats related to the pandemic.\n\nPrior to his resignation, the cybersecurity head played a critical role in protecting last November's US elections from cyber threats and vouched for its security, calling it \"the most secure in American history.\" Earlier this year, he also presided over the country's response to the major SolarWinds hack, which affected several government agencies and private companies.\n\nThe official's departure comes at a crucial time for CISA as cyber threats towards critical infrastructure, including power grids and water systems, are on the rise globally. In recent months, high-profile cyberattacks have disrupted operations at a major US oil pipeline and meatpacking plants, raising fears about the vulnerability of industries to digital sabotage.\n\nReacting to the news, several cybersecurity officials praised his leadership and warned that his exit could undermine ongoing efforts to strengthen the nation's cyber defenses.\n\n\"He consistently pushed CISA to meet the challenge of rising cyber threats,\" one former official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation. \"He recognized the gravity of the threat, and his departure is a loss at this critical juncture.\"\n\nThe government is expected to name an acting director for the agency soon. However, the resignation underscores the job's growing pressure and complexity as the US grapples with an increasingly digital world fraught with cybersecurity threats.\n\nThe White House, which has made cybersecurity a central focus of its national security strategy, didn't immediately comment on the resignation. It came just a month after President Joe Biden signed an executive order aimed at bolstering cybersecurity following the Colonial Pipeline attack.\n\nThe cybersecurity chief's resignation also adds more urgency to the ongoing debate in Congress about whether cybersecurity measures need to be bolstered to better protect the nation's critical infrastructure. Despite bipartisan support for strengthening cybersecurity, legislation has stalled amid disagreements over regulatory oversight and private sector collaboration.",

He added that consumers have shown a stronger preference for innovative gadgets and products that bring convenience to their lives amidst the heightened stay-at-home lifestyle.\n\nAnother key driver for the market's growth is the drop in the prices of gadgets. With emerging markets like China and India showing a significant increase in demand, companies are reducing their prices to gain a competitive edge. \n\nHowever, the sector will not be without its challenges. Concerns over privacy and data misuse remain a major obstacle. The gadget industry will need to ensure that as it grows, it does not compromise on data security and user privacy.\n\nNevertheless, if guided by effective policies and a forward-looking approach, the gadget market could potentially become a source of substantial growth and economic recovery in 2025. Furthermore, with the rising trend of work from home and e-learning, the demand for laptops, tablets, and other related devices is expected to gain traction.\n\nAs this shift toward virtual living becomes more apparent, it will be interesting to see how the market innovates to meet unprecedented demand for smart, user-friendly, and data-secure gadgets.",
    "A popular US television show is facing legal action over a stunt that involved contestants eating live rats. The controversial episode has sparked outrage among animal rights activists and viewers, leading to a lawsuit being filed against the production company.\n\nThe show, which has not been named due to legal reasons, aired the episode last month. Contestants were seen competing in a challenge where they were required to consume live rats. The stunt was part of a series of challenges designed to test the participants' physical and mental endurance.\n\nThe lawsuit has been filed by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who argue that the stunt constituted animal cruelty. The organization is seeking an injunction to prevent the show from airing similar stunts in the future, as well as damages for the alleged mistreatment of the rats.\n\nIn a statement, PETA said: \"This stunt was not only disgusting and offensive, but it also violated laws against animal cruelty. Rats are intelligent, sentient beings who feel pain and fear, just like any other animal. They should not be used for cheap, shock-value entertainment.\"\n\nThe production company has yet to respond to the lawsuit. However, in a previous statement, they defended the stunt, arguing that it was a legitimate test of the contestants' courage and resilience.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a wider debate about the ethics of reality TV shows, with critics arguing that they often exploit both humans and animals for entertainment. Some have called for stricter regulations to protect the welfare of participants and animals involved in such shows.\n\nThe case is expected to go to court later this year. If successful, it could set a precedent for how animals are treated in reality TV shows and other forms of entertainment.",
    "In the heart of Warsaw, a vibrant new scene is making waves in the world of music. It is a peculiar sub-genre that few would associate with the buzzing, lively compositions that are electrifying dance floors. Welcome to the realm of 'blip-pop', a style defined by the retro sounds of yesteryear’s GameBoy consoles.\n\nAkin to chiptune, this form of music sees artists utilising the iconic handheld gaming device - first produced in the late '80s - to create beats, rhythms and melodies that are tempting even the staunchest of house music stalwarts. This flourishing trend in the Polish music scene is not only creating a novel fusion of digital and analogue sounds, it is also igniting a nostalgic trip down memory lane for the millennial generation.\n\nThis youthful collective of musicians is tinkering and toying with their old GameBoys, reprogramming them into makeshift synthesizers to engineer uniquely synthesized tunes. Some artists take it a step further, combining these 8-bit sounds with conventional instruments for a fresh, multi-dimensional experience.\n\nAt the forefront of this avant-garde trend is 28-year-old Paweł Dziemian, internationally known by his moniker, 'White Gloves', who says he has found a deep emotional resonance with these rudimentary bleeps and bloops. \"It's a beautiful synergy of my childhood passion for video games and my current passion for music\", he explained.\n\nSome may question the depth that can be generated by such simplified tools. However, these artists argue that the limited range of the GameBoy's audio chip fosters creativity and inspires innovative ways to extract a broad spectrum of sounds from a single source. \n\nIn Warsaw's underground clubs, 'blip-pop' nights are becoming more frequent with these GameBoy-wielding DJs drawing in large crowds. Moreover, the interest is not confined to Poland, as international fans of electronic music are starting to tune into the 'blip-pop' scene, contributing to its expanding engagement worldwide. \n\nThough many traditionalists may still view this style as a gimmicky diversion, 'blip-pop' creators and fans argue it is a passionate homage to a key facet of their culture. With each chirp and rhythm extracted from the humble GameBoy, these Polish musicians are showcasing the expansive possibilities of music, one 'blip' at a time.",
    "Veteran Conservative MP, Sir Sayeed, has announced his decision to step down from his position, marking the end of a political career that has spanned over three decades. The announcement has triggered a by-election in his constituency, which is expected to be a closely contested battle.\n\nSir Sayeed, who has represented his constituency for over 30 years, said he had made the decision to retire after \"much thought and consideration\". He added that it had been a \"great honour\" to serve his constituents and the Conservative Party.\n\nThe MP, known for his robust defence of Conservative values, has been a prominent figure in the party, serving in various roles including as a minister in the Foreign Office. His decision to step down has been met with tributes from colleagues, who praised his dedication and commitment to public service.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said Sir Sayeed had been a \"tireless champion\" for his constituents and the Conservative Party. \"His wisdom, experience and unwavering commitment to conservative principles will be greatly missed,\" he said.\n\nThe leader of the Conservative Party, Rishi Sunak, also paid tribute to Sir Sayeed, describing him as a \"true Conservative\" who had served his constituents with \"dedication and passion\".

Several names are already being floated, but the party is yet to make an official announcement.\n\nThe by-election is expected to be a tough battle, with the opposition Labour Party hoping to capitalise on the current political climate to make gains. However, the Conservatives will be hoping to hold onto the seat, which has been a Tory stronghold for many years.\n\nSir Sayeed's decision to stand down comes at a time of significant change in British politics, with the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic reshaping the political landscape. His departure will undoubtedly be felt by his constituents and colleagues alike, as they bid farewell to a stalwart of the Conservative Party.",

The decision was made following a series of negotiations between the show's producers and local authorities.\n\nThe group, which includes a mix of actors, musicians, and reality TV stars, has been living in the jungle for the past few weeks as part of a popular reality TV show. The show, which has not been named due to contractual reasons, involves the celebrities living in the wilderness and completing a series of challenges.\n\nThe celebrities were initially scheduled to leave the jungle after a month, but the show's producers requested an extension due to the show's immense popularity. The request was initially met with resistance from local authorities, who expressed concerns about the potential environmental impact of the extended stay.\n\nHowever, after a series of discussions, the authorities have agreed to allow the celebrities to stay in the jungle for an additional two weeks. The decision was made on the condition that the show's producers take additional measures to minimise their environmental footprint.\n\nThe show's producers have agreed to these conditions and have expressed their gratitude to the authorities for their understanding.

    "German airline Lufthansa is considering legal action over disruptions caused by the visit of former US President George W. Bush to Germany. The airline claims that the extensive security measures put in place for the visit resulted in significant delays and cancellations, leading to substantial financial losses.\n\nThe former president was in Germany for a three-day visit, during which he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and other senior officials. His visit necessitated a high level of security, including airspace restrictions, which severely impacted Lufthansa's operations.\n\nA spokesperson for Lufthansa stated, \"The security measures put in place for Mr. Bush's visit were excessive and resulted in a significant number of our flights being delayed or cancelled. We are currently assessing the financial impact of these disruptions and are considering our legal options.\"\n\nThe airline has not yet disclosed the exact amount of the losses incurred, but industry insiders suggest it could run into millions of euros. Lufthansa is now in talks with its legal team to determine the feasibility of a lawsuit against the German government or the security agencies involved in coordinating the visit.\n\nThe German government has defended the security measures, stating that they were necessary given the high-profile nature of the visit. A government spokesperson said, \"The safety of our guests, especially high-ranking officials like the former US president, is our top priority. We regret any inconvenience caused to Lufthansa, but the security measures were necessary and proportionate.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that a visit by a high-profile figure has caused disruption to air travel. However, it is rare for an airline to consider legal action in response. The outcome of Lufthansa's deliberations could set a precedent for how such situations are handled in the future.\n\nLufthansa's potential lawsuit highlights the ongoing tension between the need for security during high-profile visits and the impact on businesses and the public. As world leaders continue to travel for diplomatic purposes, this issue is likely to remain a contentious one.",
    "Security experts have warned that the upcoming election could be a potential target for terrorist activities. The warning comes amid rising concerns about the safety of the democratic process in the face of increasing global terrorism.\n\nThe UK's security services have been put on high alert as the country prepares for the general election. Intelligence agencies have reportedly received information suggesting that extremist groups may be planning to disrupt the electoral process.\n\nWhile the nature of the potential threat remains unclear, experts believe that the election presents an attractive target for terrorists seeking to undermine democratic institutions and sow discord. The high-profile nature of the event, coupled with the large gatherings at polling stations, could make it a prime target.\n\nThe government has reassured the public that all necessary precautions are being taken to ensure the safety of voters. A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"We are working closely with the police and other security agencies to ensure the election takes place in a safe and secure environment.\"\n\nSecurity measures are expected to be heightened at polling stations across the country. Voters may face longer queues due to increased security checks, and are being urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.\n\nThe threat level for international terrorism in the UK currently stands at 'severe', meaning an attack is highly likely. This level has remained unchanged since 2014, reflecting the ongoing threat posed by international terrorism.\n\nDespite the warnings, experts are urging the public not to be deterred from voting. Professor Michael Clarke, a security expert at King's College London, said: \"The aim of terrorism is to create fear and disrupt our way of life. The best response is to carry on as normal, while remaining alert to any potential threats.\"\n\nThe government has also stressed the importance of not letting the threat of terrorism disrupt the democratic process. The Home Office spokesperson added: \"It is crucial that people continue to vote and make their voices heard. We will not let terrorism undermine our democracy.\"\n\nThe upcoming election is set to be one of the most closely contested in recent years, with key issues such as Brexit, the NHS, and climate change expected to dominate the campaign.",

    "For context, I recently signed a year-long lease with a new roommate, who seemed like a perfectly normal person initially. We got along pretty well and divided household chores evenly. All things ran smoothly until I discovered his utterly revolting morning routine.\n\nSo, it's been a few weeks since we've moved in together, and I keep hearing this bizarre gagging noise coming from our bathroom every morning. At first, I just assumed he was sick or having some stomach troubles. But when it persisted for a few days, I got worried and asked him if he was feeling okay.\n\nWith the most nonchalant expression on his face, he admitted that he deep-throats his toothbrush every morning. Yes, you read that right. He, fully aware, chokes himself with his toothbrush daily. Apparently, according to him, it's his unique way of ensuring he cleans every bit of his mouth, including the throat.\n\nIt's not only the disgusting sound that gets to me but also imagining someone doing that to themselves is outright horrifying. I'm usually not the one to judge someone’s personal hygiene habits, but this is beyond my comprehension.\n\nI'm now stuck with this person for a whole year. I can't bring myself to confront him—it's his personal hygiene, and it seems pretty touchy to tell someone how to brush their teeth. Tips on how to navigate this awkwardness would be appreciated. I've tried using earbuds, but the gagging noise haunts me to my core and seems to penetrate any noise barrier. \n\nTo all would-be roomies out there, maybe include \"how do you brush your teeth?\" in your list of questions when screening roommates. I certainly will from now on. Anyway, just wanted to share my cautionary tale.",
    "Last night, I experienced one of the most peculiar dreams I've ever had. \n\nIn my dream, I found myself aware that I was asleep, but rather than the usual scenario where I would control my dream events and surroundings, I was merely an observer.

It was like watching a movie where I knew I was dreaming but didn't alter the storyline or characters, like in a typical lucid dream.\n\nIt was like having a lucid dream without the lucidity. The realization that I was in a dream was present but the control was absent. I found myself powerless to change the course of the dream. Certain moments were more vivid and detailed in my memory than a usual dream, but they were not things that I had any say in.\n\nIt was almost like my subconscious was teaching me about lucid dreaming or taunting me about my lack of control. I was stuck in this quasi-lucid state, acutely aware of the dream but unable to seize control of it.\n\nI am still perplexed and fascinated about this experience. Has anyone else experienced something similar to this? This kind of one step from lucid dreaming scenario? I'd love to hear your thoughts or insights on this. Thanks!",
    "After years of dressing conservatively and hiding my body behind layers of clothing, I've decided to make a change. This year, my goal is to dress more provocatively in public. I don't mean anything inappropriate or offensive, but I want to wear clothes that make me feel sexy and confident.\n\nI've always admired women who can wear a tight dress or a low-cut top and not care about the stares or comments they might receive. I've always been too self-conscious and worried about what others might think. But I've realized that I should dress for myself, not for others.\n\nI've already started shopping for new clothes and I'm excited to start this journey. I'm not going to go from zero to a hundred overnight, but I plan to gradually incorporate more daring pieces into my wardrobe. I'm also going to work on my confidence and self-esteem, because I believe that's the key to pulling off any outfit.\n\nI'm sharing this here because I want to hold myself accountable and maybe inspire others who might be feeling the same way. I know it's going to be a challenge, but I'm ready to step out of my comfort zone and embrace this new version of myself. Wish me luck!",
    "For the past few weeks, regardless of what I consume, everything tastes the same. This has been incredibly frustrating and it's starting to negatively impact my quality of life. Whether it's pizza, coffee, ice cream or even just water, everything I put into my mouth tastes like a bland mixture of nothingness.\n\nAt first, I thought it might be a side effect of a cold or flu, but I've been healthy with no sign of illness. I've tried all sorts of strong-flavored foods to jump-start my taste buds - spicy, sour, sweet, salty - but to no avail.\n\nI have not changed anything in my daily routine or started any new medication that could have triggered this. I also keep a very keen check on oral hygiene, brushing and flossing regularly, so I doubt it's a dental issue. \n\nObviously this is quite disconcerting and I've made an appointment with my doctor to check this, but I wanted to field the topic here first. Has anyone else experienced this? What was the cause and how did you rectify the problem?",
    "I've been dealing with chronic pelvic pain for about two years now. I've been to multiple doctors, tried different medications, and even changed my diet and exercise routine, but nothing seems to help. My gynecologist recently suggested that I might have endometriosis and recommended a laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis and potentially treat it.\n\nI'm a bit nervous about the idea of surgery, even if it is minimally invasive. I've never had any kind of surgery before, so the thought of going under anesthesia and having incisions made in my abdomen is quite daunting. I'm also worried about the recovery process and potential complications.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm desperate for relief from this pain and if this could potentially provide that, I feel like I should seriously consider it. I've done some research on my own, but I would really appreciate hearing from others who have had a laparoscopy, especially if it was for endometriosis. \n\nWhat was your experience like? Was the surgery successful in diagnosing and/or treating your condition? How was the recovery process? Do you feel it was worth it? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
    "I've been struggling with these feelings for quite some time now. I know I have them, they're real, I feel them in my bones. But sometimes, I can't help but compare my situation with those of others around me and the world at large often making me wonder if my pain, my feelings, are even valid to begin with. \n\nYou see, on the outside, my life may seem quite okay - I have a stable job, a supportive family, and a roof over my head. And yet, I am plagued with this constant sense of dread, sadness, and a feeling as if I'm drowning with no one to save me. But then, I look around me and I see those who are in conditions far worse than mine. Those who are facing homelessness, battling life-threatening health issues, dealing with severe poverty - and I simply can't help but feel my struggles, my pain, are insignificant, trivial even held up against theirs. Essentially, I find myself questioning if I have a right to feel depressed? \n\nIt's an ongoing internal struggle that essentially boils down to - is my pain less valid, less severe just because it may seem less in comparison to others? It's like being caught in a vicious cycle of feeling depressed and then feeling guilty for feeling depressed. I know, logically, that everyone's pain is different and all feelings are valid. But emotionally, it's hard not to invalidate myself sometimes.\n\nSo, I just want to reach out to the community here. Have you ever felt this way? That you don't have a right to feel depressed because there are people out there who have it so much worse than you? And for those who have experienced this, how did you overcome this guilt and self-invalidating thought? I'd really appreciate any advice or guidance. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",
    "Hey everyone,\n\nI just stumbled upon this hilarious and unbelievable video on r/youseeingthisshit. It's of this cat that somehow managed to turn on a faucet and then sat back down with a nonchalant attitude as if to say, \"yeah, I did that!\"\n\nSeriously, the cat's expression at the end totally cracks me up. It's one of those classic 'you seeing this shit?' moments that makes the unpredictable humor of the internet amazing. \n\nHere is the link for those who haven't seen it: www.reddit.com/r/youseeingthisshit \n\nLet me know what you guys think!",
    "I recently got my first dose of the Covid vaccine and I've noticed that my eczema, which was previously under control, has flared up quite badly. I'm not sure if it's a direct result of the vaccine or just a coincidence, but it's definitely worse than it's been in a while. \n\nI have a prescription steroid cream that I usually use for flare-ups, but I'm a bit hesitant to use it right now. I've read that steroids can potentially lower your immune response, and I'm worried that it might interfere with the vaccine's effectiveness. \n\nHas anyone else experienced a similar situation? Did you use your steroid cream? Did it affect the vaccine's effectiveness in any way? I'm planning to call my doctor tomorrow, but I thought I'd see if anyone here had any insights or personal experiences to share. Thanks in advance!",
    "I've always been somewhat of a risk taker, my life guided by the age-old adage, \"If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much space\". That being said, I recently embarked on one of my greatest gambles yet: betting on the unproven existence and impending discovery of extraterrestrial life. More specifically, aliens of the fourth kind.\n\nFor those not in the know, encounters of \"the fourth kind\" refer to human abduction by extraterrestrials. Conventional wisdom may label me a fool, but the sheer magnitude of our universe, along with recent scientific findings, has convinced me to place my stake.\n\nNot long ago, I came across a wealthy individual willing to bet against me. He was convinced that no definitive proof of alien abduction will be found within our lifetime. More than confidence, he radiated arrogance and disdain for my belief, enough for him to wager something as significant as a house.\n\nSo it was set. The condition was simple: should definitive proof surface from credible sources, corroborated by scientists around the world, of a human having been abducted by extraterrestrials, I would win. If no proof emerges within our lifetimes, the victory – and my house – defaults to him.\n\nNow, imagine the odds I'm playing against. The scarcity of evidence we currently have on extraterrestrial life and its contact with us gives him an edge. But, as they say, when the going gets tough, the tough bet their houses.\n\nSure, people think I'm crazy. Here's the thing, though – we don't know what we don't know. The universe is an enigma, startling us with new revelations every day. Why then is the notion of the fourth kind so impossible?\n\nThis gamble has more implications than just losing my house. It is an introspective journey for me – one that makes me challenge and contemplate our place in the universe, our preconceived notions, and the boundaries of our knowledge.\n\nSometime, hopefully in my lifetime, we may witness that giant leap for mankind – a leap that proves we are not alone. Or maybe not. Either way, it is a wager I'm willing to make for the sake of possibility and wonder. \n\nTo those reading this, what are your thoughts? Would you be bold enough to bet your house on the existence of the fourth kind? Or do you think I'm setting myself up for disaster? I'd love to hear your opinions!\n",
    "Hey Redditors. I am writing this post today because I am utterly overwhelmed and frustrated with our current situation. \n\nDaily, we trudge through a world that has become a shadow of what it once was, buried beneath layers of greed, corruption, and blatant disregard for the basic rights and freedoms of individuals. It is evident that the essence of democracy, respect, and dignity has been lost to the hands of those in power, who seem to be more vested in their own self-interests, rather than the welfare of the ordinary citizen. \n\nWe don't have to take this any longer. It does not have to be like this. Through the power of collective action, we can ignite change. We live in a society where our voices can be heard, where we can vote out ill-intentioned leaders, where we can protest the unjust, where we can call for reformation when it is needed, and where we can stand up for our rights.\n\nEnough of observing in silence. It's time to take a stand. It's time to question and challenge the oppressive systems and structures that bind us. Mere acceptance of this status quo is not an option for man, they are but silent chains tethering us to a reality we do not want, did not ask for, and certainly do not have to accept. \n\nComplacency is the breeding ground for oppression. Let's break free from that. Let's be that change. Let's mobilize, organize, and strategize to propel ourselves towards a world that values fairness, equality, and justice for all. We hold significant power, and when our voices unite, we become a force that can alter the future.\n\nRemember that our silence is complicity, and that every voice counts, however small it may seem. I strongly believe that together, we can and will make a difference. Let's not stand idly by and watch as our rights, freedoms, and dignity are systematically stripped away. \n\nENOUGH IS ENOUGH... Our collective inaction has cost us more than we can afford, and it's high time we rise. Let this post serve as a reminder, a call to action, and a beacon of hope. We are stronger together, and we don't have to take this any longer. Today, let's decide to make our voices heard, to stand uncompromisingly for what is right, and to never again accept a reality that does not value us as equal, free-thinking beings. \n\nStay strong, all. Change may be slow, but it is",
    "Just finished binging the whole series and I'm absolutely blown away! The story, characters, and unexpected plot twists left me with a mix of emotions and a lot of questions. Here are some I'd love to discuss:\n\n1. What was the significance of the necklace that the main character always wore? It felt like it had a deeper meaning that never fully got explained.\n2. The ending left a lot to interpretation, so what do you think happened to the characters afterwards? \n3. There were a few side characters whose storylines felt unresolved. Can we expect them to play a bigger role in the upcoming season?\n4. Can someone explain the importance of the event taking place at the old mill? I feel like there's more to it than what was shown.\n5. How does the show's title relate to its plot? I'm still trying to understand this connection.\n\nThose are just the questions off the top of my head. Feel free to discuss and share other thoughts as well!\n\n(P.S. Please remember to use spoiler tags if you're going to delve into major plot points, just in case there are people who haven't finished watching the series!)",
    "I'm writing this post in the throes of the most challenging experience of my life, and I am in desperate need of support, advice, and understanding from those who may have gone through something similar. I feel like I am in uncharted territory and need some reassurance.\n\nI am a 37-year-old woman with PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) who has been struggling with fertility issues for as far back as I can remember. After years of frustrating doctors' appointments, a multitude of treatments, and more grueling rounds of IVF than I care to recall, I was overjoyed to finally experience the miracle of pregnancy for the very first time. The sheer happiness of those two pink lines appearing on the pregnancy test is hard to put into words. It felt like every tear, every needle prick, every hurdle that we had overcome was worth it for this moment.\n\nBut then, last week at the doctor's office, we received heartbreaking news - there was no heartbeat. As you can imagine, this news has crushed me and my partner. It feels like a cruel joke has been played on us. We were so close, and then in an instant, our dreams were taken away. The grief, frustration, confusion- it’s all too much to handle. My partner is supportive, but he has the privilege of detachment, it's not his body that failed.\n\nI'm currently waiting for a scheduled D&C procedure. The days feel long and nights longer. Physically, I'm prepared for what's to come, but emotionally, I feel desperate, hollow, and alone.\n\nI guess I'm looking for some words of comfort, similar stories, or if anyone has gotten pregnant and had a successful pregnancy after such an experience. How did you cope with this heartbreaking loss? Does it get easier? I just want some connection- some evidence that there is hope. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read through this.\n\n(Note: I understand that everyone's journey with fertility is different. One person’s experience isn't indicative of what will happen to another person. I'm not seeking medical advice in this post, just emotional support).",
    "Hello everyone,\n\nI decided to take the big leap and transition completely to digital gaming. After years of collecting, I have now amassed an extensive collection of over 5000 games - a collection that I now plan on selling. Included in my collection are titles that cover a broad spectrum of genres from Action and Adventure to Indie and RPGs. I'm sure there will be something special here for every type of gamer out there.\n\nOn top of the variety, I've also got a range of games spanning different gaming eras. From vintage Atari classics all the way up to the latest PS5 and Xbox Series X releases - you name it, and there's a high chance I have it. There are even some rare and limited edition copies for the collectors amongst you.\n\nAll the games are in excellent condition, some are even unopened. Each one is stored safely and has been well maintained. However, since shifting to an all-digital platform is now my objective, it's time for these games to find a new home. \n\nI'm currently in the process of cataloging the entire collection, but if there are any titles or platforms you're particularly interested in, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm open to selling the collection as a whole or in parts, depending on interest.\n\nFor those who are serious about purchasing, I'll be happy to provide detailed photos and descriptions of any game you're keen on. Prices are negotiable and will be based on rarity, condition, and market value. \n\nI understand holding physical games may seem like a thing of the past with digital now being the norm, but there's something about having that tangible copy in your hand that still appeals to many gamers. And now, I'm hoping my collection can bring joy to more people who share this sentiment.\n\nPlease do reach out either on this thread or via PM if you're interested in purchasing or simply discussing the games I have! It would be a pleasure to talk more about my collection.",
    "I've been noticing a trend lately that's been bothering me quite a bit. It seems like there's an increasing amount of rudeness and disrespect coming from teenagers. I'm not sure if it's just me or if others have noticed this as well.\n\nI'm not talking about the typical teenage rebellion or angst. I'm talking about outright rudeness, disrespect, and lack of manners. It's like basic etiquette has been thrown out the window. I've seen teenagers talking back to adults, being rude to service workers, and even disrespecting their own parents in public. \n\nI understand that teenagers are going through a lot of changes and it's a difficult time in their lives. But I don't think that excuses the level of rudeness I've been seeing. When I was a teenager, I would never have dreamed of acting the way some of these kids do. \n\nI'm not trying to generalize all teenagers, I know there are plenty of respectful and well-mannered young people out there. But the amount of rudeness I've been seeing is just too much to ignore. \n\nIs this just a sign of the times? Is it a result of changes in parenting styles or societal norms? Or am I just noticing it more because I'm getting older? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.",
    "Firstly, thank you for taking the time to read this post. I'm hoping to get some advice on my current situation, as I'm unsure of how to move forward.\n\nMy story starts from being an active user on several online platforms, where I, like many, found solace in online communities to share my thoughts and engage in discussions on topics that were interesting to me. However, a few months ago, I became a victim of a severe online trolling campaign.\n\nThe trolls targeted me for reasons I still can't fully understand, continuously harassing me with hateful and derogatory messages. They even went as far as doxxing me, which led to them contacting my place of employment with false accusations, resulting in me losing my job. They have also made it difficult for me to find new employment as they continue their online attacks.\n\nCyberbullying has now become the central part of my life. Browsing the internet has become a terrifying experience and every time I see a new notification, my heart pounds hard as I'm expecting more hate messages.\n\nI have reported these incidents to the authorities and the platforms where the harassment is happening, but so far there hasn't been any real help or significant changes on the situation. \n\nI'm trying to regain control of my life, but I don't know how. The whole situation has affected my mental health to the point where I can hardly concentrate or keep up with simple daily activities. I've begun seeing a therapist to cope, but it still feels like the trolls are winning.\n\nHave any of you been through something similar or can provide some advice on how to handle this? How did you handle the fear and regain your life when you were being harassed continuously? Any advice on how to restore my online reputation would be appreciated as well. If there are any resources, organizations, or people who could help me in this situation, please do share. \n\nThank you for your time.",
    "It's becoming incredibly frustrating dealing with my managers at my retail job. It seems like every time they count the drawers at the end of the night and the amount doesn't add up correctly, they automatically suspect me or whoever was running the register of mishandling the cash.\n\nFor example, last night my manager came to me and claimed that the drawer was $20 short. I am extremely careful when making transactions, always double checking that I give the correct change and putting the cash in the appropriate slots. I even go as far as to repeat the amount of change I'm giving back to the customer for my own memory's sake. \n\nWhen I tried to defend myself, the manager just dismissed my concerns and implied that the fault lied with me. There weren't any repercussions for the supposed shortage, but to have them just automatically assume I made a mistake without considering they could've potentially miscounted themselves is really insulting.\n\nAnother possibility that no one seems to consider is customers scamming us or trying to confuse us during transactions to get more change back. I try to be alert for these situations, but it's not always easy to catch in the moment, especially when the store gets busy.\n\nMaybe I’m misunderstanding the way things works around here? I’ve only been here for 3 months, but I do have previous cashiering experience and such situations have rarely happened before. \n\nJust wanted to vent a little and see if anyone else has had similar experiences. Is it common for managers to auto-blame cashiers when the till is off? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "Hello everyone!\n\nI've been a vegan for a few years now and I've found that having a few staple meals in my rotation has made meal planning so much easier. I wanted to share some of my favorites with you all in hopes that it might help someone else out there. \n\n1. **Chickpea Curry**: This is a simple, one-pot dish that's packed with protein and flavor. I usually serve it over brown rice or quinoa. \n\n2. **Vegan Tacos**: I use lentils as the 'meat' and top with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and a squeeze of lime. You can also add vegan cheese or sour cream if you like.\n\n3. **Stuffed Bell Peppers**: I stuff them with a mixture of quinoa, black beans, corn, and diced tomatoes. Top with avocado and a sprinkle of nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor.\n\n4. **Vegan Chili**: This is a hearty, filling meal that's perfect for cold weather. I use a mix of beans, lentils, and lots of veggies. \n\n5. **Pasta Primavera**: This is a great way to use up whatever veggies you have on hand. I usually use whole wheat pasta and toss it with olive oil, garlic, and a little bit of vegan parmesan.\n\n6. **Buddha Bowls**: These are so versatile and can be made with whatever you have on hand. I usually start with a grain (like quinoa or brown rice), add a protein (like chickpeas or tofu), and then pile on the veggies.\n\n7. **Vegan Stir Fry**: Another versatile dish. I use tofu as the protein and mix in whatever veggies I have on hand. I usually serve it over brown rice or noodles.\n\n8. **Vegan Pizza**: I use a pre-made crust, top with tomato sauce, veggies, and either vegan cheese or nutritional yeast. \n\n9. **Vegan Burrito Bowl**: I start with brown rice, add black beans, corn, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and a little bit of salsa. \n\n10. **Vegan Pancakes**: These are great for a weekend breakfast. I top mine with fresh fruit and a little bit of maple syrup.\n\nI hope these ideas help you out! I'd love to hear what your staple vegan meals are.",

    "I've been a long-time lurker on this platform, and I've finally decided to share something that's been bothering me for quite some time. It's about the lack of empathy and understanding in online communities, including Reddit.\n\nI've noticed that people are quick to judge and slow to understand. They often jump to conclusions without knowing the full story or understanding the context. This is not only unfair but also discourages people from sharing their thoughts and experiences. \n\nFor instance, I've seen posts where someone shares a personal struggle or a difficult situation they're going through, only to be met with harsh criticism or dismissive comments. Instead of offering support or advice, some users choose to belittle or ridicule the person. This kind of behavior is not only hurtful but also counterproductive. It creates a hostile environment where people are afraid to speak up or share their experiences.\n\nI understand that everyone is entitled to their opinion, and not everyone will agree on everything. But there's a difference between having a healthy debate and being outright disrespectful. We need to remember that behind every username is a real person with real feelings. \n\nI'm not saying we should all agree with each other or avoid difficult conversations. But we should strive to be more understanding and empathetic. We should listen more and judge less. We should treat each other with kindness and respect, even when we disagree.\n\nI hope this post encourages more people to be mindful of how they interact with others online. Let's make this community a safe and welcoming place for everyone. Thanks for reading.",
    "The concept of self is often debated in philosophical and psychological circles. Some argue that the self is an illusion, a construct of our minds to make sense of our existence. If we accept this premise, then what does it mean for the power of self? \n\nThe power of self is often associated with self-awareness, self-control, and self-determination. It's the ability to make decisions, to control our actions, and to shape our own destiny. But if the self is an illusion, then what is this power fundamentally?\n\nIs it just another illusion? Or is it a manifestation of something deeper, something more fundamental? Could it be a manifestation of our biological processes, our genetic makeup, or our environmental influences? Or could it be a manifestation of some universal consciousness or energy?\n\nIf the self is an illusion, then perhaps the power of self is also an illusion. But even if it is, it's an illusion that has real effects. It influences our behavior, our relationships, and our society. It shapes our reality.\n\nSo, even if the self is an illusion, the power of self is still a fundamental aspect of our existence. It's a tool that we use to navigate the world, to make sense of our experiences, and to create meaning in our lives.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? How do you perceive the power of self if the self is indeed an illusion? I'm interested to hear your perspectives.",

I've had two sessions with him so far and I'm feeling a bit shocked and uncomfortable with his approach. \n\nIn our first session, he seemed to be in a rush, constantly checking his watch. He didn't ask much about my history or my current mental health status. Instead, he quickly prescribed me a new medication, different from what I was taking before. \n\nIn our second session, he spent most of the time talking about his personal life and his achievements, leaving very little time for me to discuss my issues.

    "I've been questioning my sexuality for a little while now and I could really use some advice from others who may have experienced similar confusion. I was raised quite conservatively, so I always assumed I was straight. However, recently, I've been finding myself attracted to other women.\n\nI've read about compulsory heterosexuality (comphet) and part of me wonders if the small amount of attraction I feel towards men might actually be a product of societal pressures rather than my own genuine feelings. The idea of being with a man isn't entirely unappealing, but when I think of emotionally intimate and physical scenarios, it's always been easier for me to imagine them with women.\n\nAt the same time, I'm worried that I may be interpreting my close feelings of friendship or admiration for women as something more because of how I have grown more accepting of different sexualities. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or guidance they can offer? How can I differentiate between what might be comphet and what might be real romantic or sexual attraction? \n\nThank you so much in advance for your help. Your insights would be greatly appreciated in this confusing time.",

    "As many of us in the nursing field are probably aware, the 21st Century Cures Act is a law signed by President Obama in 2016 with the aim of transforming our healthcare by speeding up drug development, investing in research, and driving innovation. However, there is a lesser known section that directly impacts nurses and how we document our patient interactions - the Interoperability and Information Blocking provision. \n\nWith this provision, patients will now have access to their clinical notes via electronic health records (EHR), which includes nursing documentation. The idea behind this is to embolden patients to take control of their own healthcare by being more informed. As a nurse, this means that everything you document in your patient's EHR will be accessible to them, including observations, assessments, conditions, care plans, etc.\n\nWhat implications does this have for us as nurses? How will this impact the manner and the language in which we record our notes? For instance, any jargon or shorthand that we use -- as second nature to medical professionals, but jibberish to the average patient -- will have to be reevaluated. In my view, it places greater emphasis on the transparency and clarity of our notes, while also effectively communicating what was done and why it was done so to patients who read them.\n\nFurthermore, if patients do not understand what we’ve written or why we have done something, it could lead to an increased number of questions and potential legal implications down the line. This makes it even more important to thoroughly document everything and ensure it’s written in an accessible manner.\n\nIs there any training or guidance provided by your respective healthcare facilities to ensure that notes remain professional, accurate, and understandable for patients? How do you feel about the provision and its potential implications for nursing practice?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts, experiences, and insights on this matter!",
    "I wanted to share my experience with the Pfizer vaccine to help alleviate any fears or concerns some of you might have. \n\nI received my first dose yesterday at a local pharmacy. The process was smooth and well-organized. I had to fill out a form with basic health-related questions and then waited for about 15 minutes before my turn. The shot itself was quick and relatively painless, just like a regular flu shot. \n\nAfter the shot, they had me wait for 15 minutes to monitor for any immediate adverse reactions. I felt completely fine, just a slight soreness in my arm which is pretty normal for any vaccine. \n\nLater in the day, I felt a bit tired and the soreness in my arm increased a bit, but nothing too severe. I took it easy for the rest of the day, drank lots of water and got a good night's sleep. \n\nToday, I woke up feeling pretty much back to normal. The arm soreness has decreased significantly and I haven't experienced any other side effects. \n\nOverall, it was a straightforward and simple process. I'm relieved to have gotten the first dose and looking forward to getting the second one. I would encourage everyone to get vaccinated when it's your turn. It's a small step we can all take to protect ourselves and those around us. \n\nRemember, everyone's experience with the vaccine can be different. Some might have more side effects than others, but it's important to remember that these are usually short-lived and a sign that your body is building protection against the virus. \n\nStay safe everyone!",
    "So, around a month ago, I started noticing my laptop restarting out of nowhere when I'm working on it. It's not an old laptop or anything, I bought it around a year ago. I have updated all my drivers, installed all Windows updates, and even formatted it, hoping that would solve the problem. But it's still happening and is now accompanied by a strange noise, sort of like a faint clicking sound coming from within the laptop. I suspected it could be a hard disk problem, but diagnostics reveal no issues.\n\nTo add to the mystery, the restarting episodes are utterly random. Sometimes it happens twice in a span of an hour and sometimes it works perfectly fine for days and then restarts. It’s really driving me nuts because I mainly depend on my laptop for work.\n\nI've reached out to customer support, they didn't seem to have an immediate solution either and suggested handing it over for physical examination, which could take weeks. Considering the times we are living in, I am not able to part with my laptop for such a long time. \n\nI'm definitely not tech-savvy, but I'm hoping someone here could share a similar experience. Maybe it’s just something simple I'm missing? Any suggestions, no matter how seemingly trivial, would be immensely appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n",
    "I've been pondering this for a while now and I thought I'd reach out to the Reddit community for some insights. I consider myself a pretty social person. I have a good circle of friends, I'm active in various clubs and organizations, and I don't have any issues striking up conversations with new people. I'm not shy or introverted, and I genuinely enjoy socializing.\n\nHowever, when it comes to girls, it's a different story. I can talk to them, make them laugh, and have great conversations, but it never seems to go beyond that. I've tried asking girls to hang out, but I usually get responses like \"I'm busy\" or \"maybe another time\". I've also tried expressing my feelings to a few girls I was really interested in, but it didn't lead anywhere. \n\nI'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've been told I'm a nice guy, I'm respectful, and I try to be a good listener. I'm not the most attractive guy out there, but I don't think I'm unattractive either. I've tried online dating, but it hasn't worked out for me. \n\nI'm starting to feel a bit discouraged and I'm not sure what to do. Is anyone else in the same boat? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.",
    "I've been feeling a bit lost lately. It's like I'm stuck in a constant state of numbness, where everything feels dull and uninteresting. I've lost the motivation to do things I once enjoyed, like reading, writing, or even hanging out with friends. It's not that I'm sad or depressed, it's just that I don't feel anything at all. \n\nI've tried to push myself to do things, but it feels like I'm just going through the motions. I've tried setting goals, but they seem meaningless when I don't have the drive to achieve them. I've tried to find new hobbies, but nothing seems to spark any interest. \n\nI'm not sure what's causing this. I've had periods of low motivation before, but they've never lasted this long or felt this intense. I'm not sure if it's due to stress, burnout, or something else entirely. \n\nI'm reaching out to this community because I'm not sure where else to turn. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you cope? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I just want to feel like myself again.",
    "I had been saving these cookies for a while now. They were special, imported from a small bakery in France, and I had been savoring them slowly, one by one. I had only three left, and I was planning to enjoy them over the weekend with a good book and a cup of coffee.\n\nI came home today to find the cookie box empty. My mom had eaten them. She didn't even ask. She just saw the box, opened it, and ate my cookies. I confronted her about it and she just shrugged it off, saying she didn't know they were special and that she would buy me more cookies. But she doesn't understand. These weren't just any cookies. They were special, and I had been saving them.\n\nI'm so angry right now. I know it's just cookies, but it's the principle of the thing. She didn't ask, she didn't consider that they might be important to me. She just took what she wanted without a second thought. I feel like my feelings and my things don't matter to her. I'm just so frustrated and upset right now. I needed to vent. Thanks for listening, Reddit.",
    "Hey there, fellow Redditors. I've been contemplating something for a while, and I suppose it's time to finally voice it out.\n\nI'm currently in my final year of school, with just a few months left until graduation. Every day it's the same routine. I wake up, attend classes, engage in extracurricular activities and come back home. I thought getting an education was my key to freedom, but now, it just feels like I've traded one cage for another.\n\nMy parents have my whole life planned out: graduate, attend a prestigious university they've chosen, get a degree in a field they find worthwhile, get a stable job, find a suitable spouse, raise children and then retire. This thought scares me. Not because these are not great plans, they are. There's a lot of comfort in that lifestyle. But it scares me because this is not MY plan. It's not MY dream. It's theirs. \n\nI realize dreaming might seem childish, but I have this feeling deep down in my soul that if I don't at least TRY to chase my own dreams, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. I want to explore the world, meet new people, learn from different cultures, and maybe try to make a living from my passion for filming and storytelling. \n\nI'm thinking of running away once I graduate. Not running away from my problems or responsibilities. Not running away forever. But running away to find who I really am, to fight for what I want in life, and to make sure that my life is a result of my choices, not someone else's. \n\nMaybe this is the rebellious spirit that comes with youth, or maybe it's just fear manifesting. But then I ask myself - isn't it more terrifying to live a life not entirely yours? Maybe some of you have been in similar situations, or maybe you can lend some advice? I’d be grateful to hear your thoughts. \n\nIs it foolish? Should I throw caution to the wind and go on this adventure I crave? Or should I follow the plan and resent every moment of it? Any kind words or harsh realities are welcome; I'm equally in need of both.",
    "I've been using the Poco X3 NFC for a couple of months now and I've been experiencing some issues with the cellular connection and internet. The connection seems to be constantly interrupting, which is quite frustrating. \n\nI've noticed that the signal strength fluctuates a lot, even when I'm in areas where I know the signal should be strong. This leads to dropped calls and slow internet speeds. I've also noticed that the internet connection often drops out completely, even when the signal strength is showing as strong. \n\nI've tried resetting the network settings, switching between 2G, 3G, and 4G, and even tried using a different SIM card, but none of these have resolved the issue. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue with their Poco X3 NFC? If so, were you able to find a solution? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance!",
    "I've been thinking a lot about sexuality lately, and I've come to the conclusion that it's really just about pleasure. Whether you're straight, gay, bi, or somewhere else on the spectrum, the ultimate goal is to find pleasure and happiness in your relationships and sexual experiences.\n\nSexuality is a complex and deeply personal aspect of our identities. It's not just about who we're attracted to, but also how we experience and express that attraction. It's about the emotional connections we form, the physical sensations we enjoy, and the fantasies we indulge in. It's about exploring our desires and discovering what makes us feel good.\n\nIn our society, we often get caught up in labels and categories. We feel the need to define ourselves and others based on who we're attracted to. But at the end of the day, these labels are just a way to describe our experiences. They don't define us or limit our potential for pleasure.\n\nWhether you're attracted to men, women, both, or neither, it's important to remember that your sexuality is valid. Your experiences are valid. Your pleasure is valid. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nSo let's stop focusing so much on labels and start focusing more on pleasure. Let's create a culture where everyone feels free to explore their sexuality without fear of judgment or shame. Let's celebrate the diversity of our desires and the many different ways we can experience pleasure.\n\nAfter all, isn't that what sexuality is really about?",
    "It's been a week since I tried to log into my Instagram account, only to encounter a strange situation. After entering my details, the app suddenly prompted me to enter my mobile number for verification. Though surprised, I complied and entered my correct phone number. Instead of sending me a confirmation code as most apps would, Instagram threw me a curveball saying my account will be under review for 24 hours. \n\nWhat piques my curiosity is the absence of a security code sent to my mobile number. However, more worrying is the elongated review time of 24 hours, even after seven days there is neither an update nor access to my own account, making it clear it was a hollow promise. \n\nI've attempted to reach out to Instagram's customer support but, unfortunately, I'm met with deafening silence on their end as well. \n\nHas anyone else faced a similar issue? And if so, how did you resolve it? I would greatly appreciate any help from this community in retrieving my account. Cheers!",
    "So, here's my predicament. Over the last couple of months, I'd gotten pretty close to a girl in my circle of friends. She was really sympathetic and open-minded, and over time, I realized I was developing feelings for her. Being an introverted and somewhat shy person, I held back from expressing my feelings instantly. Instead, I tried to subtly drop hints to see how she would react.\n\nWe spent a lot of time together and a lot of our conversations seemed to steer towards topics regarding sexuality. She was very candid about being a lesbian. I admired her openness and she seemed devoid of the judgment that can sometimes come from others, so I felt comfortable talking about myself in a more in-depth way than usual.\n\nHere comes the twist. She recently revealed to me that she had assumed I was gay due to some statements I'd made in our conversations about my lack of luck with women, I guess they came across as more \"gay\" than I'd thought. It never occurred to me to explicitly state that I wasn't, because I assumed she knew.\n\nSo now I'm sitting here, having feelings for a girl who not only isn't interested in men but also thought that I too was not interested in women. I feel like I'm stuck in a place where there's no possible romantic future for us, but I still value our friendship too much to distance myself.\n\nI guess I'm here just to vent but also to ask if anyone else has gotten themselves into such confusing situations, and if so, how did you cope? Any advice, kind words, or reassurances would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading.\n",
    "As the title suggests, I am back, having screwed up once more. I am not proud, but then again who would be? I apologise in advance for the lengthy rant you are about to read, and the mistakes it brims with that not many may understand. But, here goes.\n\nTo preface things, a little over 4 months ago, I messed up big time. Substance abuse and unchecked impulsivity had led me to a path of self-destruction and toxicity. I lost my job, my long-term relationship crashed and burned, and I ended up being alienated from friends and family. It was a complete mess. To add fuel to the fire, I posted about it on this sub and got a massive dose of reality from all of you kind souls out there.\n\nThen, something inside me kindled a desperate wish to change and get help. I sought therapy, and for a while there, things seemed to be getting better. The days, though still gloomy, had brief glimpses of light. However, just this last week, I’ve faltered. I started spiraling back into old habits and poor decisions. I don't even understand why, everything was seemingly improving.\n\nThis past week, I have found myself slipping back into that dark abyss of substance use. I have been missing my therapy sessions, ignoring calls from friends, and basically regressing back into that dark place I was in earlier this year. It's like that beckoning shadow of self-destruction has found a comprehensive map back to my life.\n\nI had promised myself ― and you all ― that I would do better, and here I am, having mucked it all up once again. The remorse and guilt are gnawing at me, consuming me from the inside. I just don't understand why I keep sabotaging my own chances at recovery and happiness.\n\nI'm not looking for sympathy, nor am I fishing for compliments. I just needed to share this, to be accountable at some level. For those who may be in their own recovery journeys, I hope this serves as a warning. The path is never linear; the remorse from a relapse can sting you worse than you'd think.\n\nFellow Redditors, it feels like I am trapped in this self-made bane of existence. It feels like I am in quicksand, the more I struggle, the further I sink. If anyone has ever felt like this, and has managed to fight their way out, please help a brother out.\n\nThank you for reading. Here's",

It's like a constant, heavy weight on my chest that I can't shake off. I've tried therapy, medication, exercise, meditation, you name it. Nothing seems to work. I feel like I'm drowning and there's no one around to save me. \n\nI've had suicidal thoughts before, but they've never been this intense.

    "I've been struggling with my sexuality for a while now and I'm hoping to get some advice or insight from this community. I identify as a woman and I've always been attracted to men, but recently I've been questioning if my attraction is genuine or if it's just compulsory heterosexuality (comphet).\n\nI've had relationships with men in the past and while I did feel some level of attraction, I've always felt like something was missing. I've never been able to shake off the feeling that I'm just going through the motions and doing what's expected of me. I've also found myself increasingly attracted to women, but I'm not sure if this is a genuine attraction or just a reaction to my dissatisfaction with my relationships with men.\n\nI've read the masterdoc on comphet and a lot of it resonated with me, but I'm still confused. I'm scared of coming out as a lesbian only to realize later that I was wrong. I'm also scared of continuing to date men and ignoring a part of myself that might be real.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for advice from people who have been in a similar situation. How did you figure out if your attraction was real or just comphet? How did you navigate the confusion and fear? Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.",
    "So, last night, a few friends and I decided to hang out in the parking lot of our local mall. We had a portable speaker, some snacks, and a couple of skateboards. It was all fun and games, just a bunch of 20-somethings trying to relive our teenage years. We were laughing, joking around, and even attempting some skateboard tricks (which we were terrible at, by the way).\n\nSuddenly, we saw the flashing lights. A police car pulled into the parking lot. We all froze, not because we were doing anything illegal, but because it's always a bit nerve-wracking when the cops show up unexpectedly. The officer stepped out of the car and walked towards us. He asked what we were doing and we explained that we were just hanging out.\n\nHe told us that someone had called in a noise complaint. We apologized and promised to keep the noise down. He was pretty cool about it, even laughed at our failed attempts at skateboarding. He left us with a warning and we decided to call it a night.\n\nSo, yeah, it was all fun in the parking lot until the cops showed up. But hey, at least we have a story to tell now!",
    "I recently rewatched Black Panther and it was a bittersweet experience. The movie itself is a masterpiece, but knowing that Chadwick Boseman, the actor who played T'Challa/Black Panther, is no longer with us makes it incredibly hard to watch. His performance was so powerful and he embodied the character so well that it's difficult to imagine anyone else in that role. \n\nEvery scene he's in is a reminder of the talent we lost. It's heartbreaking to think that we won't see him in future Marvel movies. His death was a huge loss not just for the film industry, but for the world. He was a role model for so many people and his portrayal of Black Panther was a source of inspiration and pride for the black community.\n\nI'm grateful for the legacy he left behind and the impact he had, but it's still hard to watch Black Panther without feeling a sense of sadness. I'm sure many of you feel the same way. Let's use this thread to share our favorite Chadwick Boseman moments and celebrate his life and career.",
    "So, just like many of you, I've found myself down many rabbit holes, investigating AoT and its sudden end. The abrupt tone shift, the character inconsistencies, the loose ends, it just didn't feel like AoT. It frustrated me, as I believed so deeply in Isayama’s storytelling and character development.\n\nI began looking back into past interviews and panels to see if Isayama ever mentioned anything about how he planned on ending Attack on Titan.\n\nAnd surprisingly, there were numerous instances where Isayama's comments did not line up with the end we were presented with.\n\nThe most significant being his infamous 2013 interview in which he stated that he had planned a 'traumatic' ending similar to Stephen King's 'Mist.' Another instance was in the August 2020 Bessatsu Shonen Magazine interview where he stated that the current finale we got was the result of him wanting to reject the idea of a \"tragic hero\" ending. Not to mention, he had already planned out AoT's ending by 2018. However, the narrative shift hinting towards AoT’s final ending happened only in 2019, way after 2018.\n\nAll this and much more make it very evident that the ending we got isn't what Isayama had originally thought of. The Isayama we know is a master of handling narratives with multiple layers of complexity, and to just leave us with such a simplified version, it just does not add up. \n\nThis is not to say that we should disregard the current ending or launch campaigns demanding a \"better\" ending. No, not at all. Isayama has given us the right to perceive the story with our own interpretation. \n\nLooking at all this, it simply comforts me to know that Attack on Titan, the story I had invested in, was meant to end differently. It provides closure to my frustration and helps me reconcile with the final chapters.\n\nRegardless of our varied opinions, I think one thing that unites us all is the profound love and respect we have for Isayama and his creation. So here's hoping for more clarity and resolution in the future! Let’s continue supporting and appreciating AoT in all its glory.\n\nLet's be thankful for the journey that Attack on Titan has taken us, and let's see what the future holds. Trust in the process, trust in Isayama.",

    "Firstly, it's important to note that everyone's body chemistry is different, so what works for one person may not work for another. However, here are some general tips that can help you smell good all day, every day.\n\n1. **Hygiene**: This is the most basic step. Shower daily, use a good quality body wash, and don't forget to exfoliate your skin once or twice a week to get rid of dead skin cells. \n\n2. **Deodorant/Antiperspirant**: Invest in a good quality deodorant or antiperspirant. If you sweat a lot, you might want to consider a clinical-strength antiperspirant. \n\n3. **Perfume/Cologne**: Find a scent that you love and that works well with your body chemistry. Apply it to your pulse points (wrists, neck, behind the ears) for the best effect. \n\n4. **Diet**: What you eat can affect how you smell. Try to eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Avoid foods with strong odors like garlic and onions if you're worried about body odor.\n\n5. **Clothing**: Wear clean clothes made of natural fibers like cotton, which allow your skin to breathe. \n\n6. **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water can help flush toxins out of your body, which can improve your overall scent.\n\n7. **Regular Exercise**: Regular exercise can help regulate your body's natural functions, including sweat, which can help you smell better.\n\n8. **Good Oral Hygiene**: Brush and floss regularly, and consider using a tongue scraper to keep your breath fresh.\n\nRemember, it's normal for your body to have a scent and it's not always going to be roses and sunshine. The goal is to smell clean and fresh, not to cover up your natural scent with a cloud of perfume or cologne.",

    "I've had strong feelings for a girl in my university for quite a while now. We share some classes and I've had the opportunity to observe her a bit. From what I've gathered, we have quite a lot in common. Same major, shared interests in certain types of music, films, and hobbies. I could, however, never muster up the courage to approach her due to my anxiety and fear of rejection.\n\nRecently, I found her Instagram by chance while browsing through a mutual friend's post. I didn't follow her immediately because I was unsure if it would make her uncomfortable. Few people are okay with strangers suddenly following their social media platforms. Also, we've never really had a conversation apart from group discussions during assignments.\n\nI've been wanting to strike up a conversation with her, maybe about our common interests and see if that could eventually lead to friendship, and then possibly something more.

    "Hello Redditors,\n\nI wanted to share a dilemma my dad is currently facing with his healthcare situation and see if anyone out there has some advice or suggestions on how we can navigate this issue. \n\nMy dad is 65 years old and has been on Social Security for the last few years. Every month, he receives $1900, which should theoretically be enough to cover his basic needs. However, the issue comes in when it comes to securing healthcare. \n\nUnfortunately, my dad makes 'too much money' to be eligible for Medicaid, which of course would have been the most financially sound option for him. On the other hand, the lowest monthly premium he could find for health insurance is approximately $1100. To paint a clearer picture, this means that more than half of his monthly income is being swallowed up by healthcare costs alone, leaving scant resources for essentials like food, transportation, housing etc. \n\nObviously, this is not sustainable in any way. The huge discrepancy between his income and his healthcare costs is causing a great deal of stress and worry, and we truly do not know what the best course of action is. \n\nIf anyone has some insight or perhaps some experience in dealing with similar situations, any input would go a long way. We're open to exploring any possible options, whether it be other health insurance choices we may have overlooked, alternative assistance programs, or even tips on how to reduce healthcare costs.\n\nThank you in advance!",

The central drama of Anakin Skywalker's momentous fall to the dark side and the larger bustling background of interstellar war merge seamlessly into a cohesive and compelling narrative.\n\nHayden Christensen delivers an all-consuming performance as the Jedi Anakin Skywalker, exquisitely capturing his character's internal struggles and gradual tilt towards the dark side. Ewan McGregor, in his reprisal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, provides the emotional bedrock of the film, masterfully shouldering his character's grief and betrayal. Together, their climactic lightsaber duel is one of the franchise's most emotionally potent and spectacularly choreographed sequences.\n\nLucas' strategic use of CGI is commendable, adorning the film with some awe-inspiring landscapes and futuristic cityscapes. Despite some blemishes in the dialogue, largely embedded in Lucas' famed expository style, the emotive performances of the cast transcend these minor hurdles and inject a much-needed humanity into this grand space opera.\n\nJohn Williams elevates the film with his iconic score, beautifully underscoring the spectacular action sequences and the poignant character dialogues. His music remains one of the irrefutable anchors that continues to bind this franchise together and resonate with audiences across generations. \n\nIn essence, \"Revenge of the Sith\" may not be perfect, but it fittingly encapsulates the tragedy, grandeur, and pathos that characterize the Star Wars franchise.

    "Training Day exceeds in providing a raw and gritty depiction of life within harsh environments, offering an intriguing glance at the darker side of law enforcement through the lens of director Antoine Fuqua. Undeniably, Denzel Washington’s portrayal of a morally ambiguous LAPD detective, Alonzo Harris, is riveting and engrossing, warranting the Academy Award win for Best Actor it fetched him. \n\nThe intense and bumpy narrative ride, with a backdrop of menacing Los Angeles streets, is as hauntingly powerful as it is frightening. Ethan Hawke deserves equal commendations for his performance as a rookie cop navigating the tricky terrain between upholding justice and being sucked into corruption.

    "Amidst the realm of witty, delightful, and endearing teenage flicks, \"She's the Man\" manages to stand on its own as an exceptionally entertaining film. The script nods to a modernized William Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\", beautifully repackaging and relocating the 17th-century play in an American boarding school setting. Amanda Bynes, in the prime of her career, brilliantly embodies a strong, funny, and unique character that goes against societal constraints. Her portrayal of Viola/Sebastian reveals how fluid she could be as an actress, maneuvering between the binaries of male and female.\n\nDuke Orsino, played by Channing Tatum, is projected as the charming and sincere love interest.

    "\"Jerry Maguire\" is arguably one of the best romantic comedy dramas made in the late 90s. Directed by Cameron Crowe, and starring Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr., the film delivers an endearing story laced with sharp humor, deep emotion, and real-life issues in both personal and professional relationships.\n\nTom Cruise, in one of his most legendary roles, plays Jerry Maguire, a high-flying sports agent who has a moral epiphany and is subsequently fired from his firm. Cruise’s charismatic performance is central to the film’s appeal. His portrayal of Maguire’s journey from cynical success to humbled failure and eventual real success is riveting. It's Cruise at his versatile best - the quintessential 'cocky man who falls, learns his lessons, and finds true love and purpose' story.\n\nRenee Zellweger is brilliant as Dorothy Boyd, a single mother who believes in Jerry’s vision and ultimately falls in love with him. Her earnest and endearing presence in the movie is refreshing and her on-screen chemistry with Cruise is palpable. \n\nBut it is Cuba Gooding Jr., playing the character of Rod Tidwell, an Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, who steals the show. Gooding Jr. injects a high-octane energy into the movie and provides some of its funniest and most poignant moments.\n\nThe screenplay by Cameron Crowe is a masterstroke, it provides a fresh and intimate perspective on the cut-throat world of sports management while weaving a deeply heartfelt love story. The movie’s most famous line, “Show me the money!” is iconic and has ever since been etched into pop culture memory.\n\nThe film does have its melodramatic moments that verge on the sappy, stretching the suspension of disbelief, but these are minor flaws in an otherwise beautifully executed cinematic piece.\n\nAll in all, “Jerry Maguire” is an enjoyable film that delivers on many fronts – it’s a love story, a sports drama, and a reflection on the struggles of maintaining integrity in a profit-driven society. It appeals to both the romantics who swoon over Cruise and Zellweger’s love story, as well as the sports enthusiasts who get behind-the-scenes insights into the world of sports agents.",
    "\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" is an ethereal blend of mystic martial arts, profound philosophy, and compelling storytelling that truly redefines the genre. It transcends beyond being just an action film, morphing into a dramatic portrayal of love, honor, and self-discovery, all told through the language of meticulously choreographed fight sequences.\n\nThe directing by Ang Lee is nothing short of groundbreaking, elevating the medium with his incredible attention to aesthetic details and seamless integration of traditional Chinese culture with mythical elements.

Relationships between the characters are built upon deep emotional foundations, which in combination with the exquisite performances of the cast, make for an enchantingly riveting narrative.\n\nMichelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-fat portray their characters with compelling authenticity, bringing depth and complexity that many action films lack. Zhang Ziyi is as enthralling as ever, putting forth a layered performance that covers a range of emotions and motivations. The cast's abilities to portray their characters, each with their own truths, is a testament to both their acting prowess and the film's exceptional screenplay.\n\nThe iconic fight scenes are a vision in themselves. Combining elements of fantasy with authentic martial arts movements, these sequences are brought to life with a dreamlike elegance that is spellbinding. The use of wires and dramatic cinematography create a sense of onscreen magic that is a joy to watch.\n\nSimply put, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" is a masterpiece that seamlessly fuses exhilarating martial arts with deep-seated human emotions.

It's not just a movie; it's an unforgettable cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll.",
    "\"The Fly\" is a masterstroke of horror and science fiction, seamlessly blending the two genres into a chilling narrative that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats. Directed by David Cronenberg, the film is a remake of the 1958 classic, but it stands on its own as a unique and terrifying exploration of the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition.\n\nJeff Goldblum delivers a career-defining performance as Seth Brundle, a brilliant but eccentric scientist who becomes the victim of his own experiment. Goldblum's transformation from a charming, quirky genius to a grotesque human-insect hybrid is both horrifying and heartbreaking. His nuanced portrayal of a man losing his humanity is the backbone of the film, and it's impossible to look away, no matter how gruesome the visuals become.\n\nGeena Davis is equally impressive as Veronica Quaife, a journalist who becomes entangled in Brundle's life and experiment. Davis brings a depth and emotional complexity to her character, making her more than just a damsel in distress. Her relationship with Brundle adds a layer of tragic romance to the film, further enhancing the emotional impact.\n\nCronenberg's direction is superb, creating an atmosphere of creeping dread that permeates every scene. The special effects, while dated by today's standards, are still effective and contribute to the overall sense of horror. The film's exploration of themes such as the ethics of scientific experimentation, the fear of bodily decay, and the loss of identity are thought-provoking and add depth to the narrative.\n\n\"The Fly\" is not for the faint of heart. It's a gruesome, disturbing film that pushes the boundaries of body horror. However, beneath the gore and horror, it's a tragic love story and a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked ambition. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, a testament to its powerful storytelling and unforgettable performances.",
    "\"The Big Blue\" is a visually stunning journey through the depths of human emotion and the sea. The director, Luc Besson, wonderfully harnesses the power of cinema to instill a sense of awe and wonder in viewers. Beautifully set in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, this film truly captures the majesty of nature, coupled with a gripping storyline.\n\nThe performances are undeniably compelling, with Jean-Marc Barr's portrayal of the free diver Jacques Mayol capturing your heart and imagination. Rosanna Arquette and Jean Reno's performances further add depth and complexity to this rich narrative. Each character is intricately crafted, and their struggles and victories keep you invested throughout the film.\n\n\"The Big Blue\" is more than just a movie about diving - it's a movie about obsession, friendship, love, and the eternal human quest for freedom. The script magically combines elements of drama and adventure, leaving you to experience a whirlwind of emotions.\n\nThe cinematography deserves special recognition. The underwater scenes are a testament to the beauty of our oceans and the mystery that it holds. It's filmed with such realism and grace, you feel as though you're diving into the depths of the ocean along with the characters.\n\nEnnio Morricone's score is another highlight. The hauntingly beautiful music enhances the film's ethos - the melancholy, the joy, the tension. Also, the ending is bound to leave you contemplative, thinking about the vastness of the human spirit and the world around us.\n\nMy only criticism would be the length of the film. Due to the slow-paced narrative, at times, it can feel slightly drawn out. However, this can be overlooked considering the overall enchanting experience \"The Big Blue\" provides.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Big Blue\" is an extraordinary film that, much like the sea, is profound and captivating. It is a cinematic experience that will both move you and marvel you, leaving you to question the very essence of freedom. Despite certain minor flaws, it's worth immersing yourself in this poignant tale of love, friendship, and one man's relationship with the sea.”",
    "\"Die Hard 2\", directed by Renny Harlin, manages not only to uphold the high-octane standards of the original but also pushes the envelope when it comes to action cinema. This sequel commits wholly to its adrenaline-fueled spectacle, drawing us into another audacious adventure with the truly indomitable protagonist, John McClane, played exceptionally by Bruce Willis. \n\nBruce Willis exemplifies the cut-throat resilience of McClane immaculately, displaying an admirable level of tenacity and grit. His exceptional portrayal of a common man encompassed by unusual circumstances manages to hold the viewers spellbound, making him the quintessential action hero. \n\nEven though the rogue-in-an-airport plot feels uncannily similar to the original's confined-in-a-skyscraper scenario, the script makes an effort to introduce refreshing elements including a wide range of antagonists and numerous intertwined sub-plots. The antagonist, Colonel Stuart, played by William Sadler, is calculated, cold, and formidable; Sadler's impressive portrayal emulates an aura that is as chilling as it is intriguing.\n\nThe direction is slick, the pace is relentless, and Harlin's clear penchant for extravagant action sequences is on full display, particularly in the finale which resonates with an exhilarating climax. The use of practical effects makes the movie feel grounded and real, adding to the suspense and thrill. \n\n\"Die Hard 2\" features a winning mix of humor and action, with Willis' trademark one-liners cutting through the relentless tension, serving to further endear McClane to audiences as an everyday hero.\n\nHowever, the movie is not without its shortcomings. Some sections of the film are arguably cluttered with too many underdeveloped characters. Also, the narrative continuity seems to falter occasionally due to the movie's dizzying pace that, while exciting, does not allow every plot twist to fully ferment. \n\nDespite its flaws, \"Die Hard 2\" delivers on what it primarily sets out to do - entertain its viewers with nail-biting action sequences, punchy dialogue, and an iconic protagonist. It may not be quite as sharp as the original, but it's a thrilling, fast-paced follow-up that's more than worth a watch for any action cinema aficionada.",
    "\"Skyfall\" is a thrilling and captivating addition to the James Bond franchise. Directed by Sam Mendes, the film is a perfect blend of action, suspense, and drama, with a storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\n\nDaniel Craig, in his third outing as James Bond, delivers a performance that is both nuanced and compelling. He portrays a Bond who is not just a suave and invincible spy, but also a man grappling with his past and his place in a rapidly changing world. Judi Dench, as M, is equally impressive, bringing a depth and complexity to her character that is rarely seen in the franchise.\n\nThe film's cinematography is stunning, with each frame meticulously crafted to create a visual spectacle. The action sequences are breathtaking, particularly the opening chase scene in Istanbul and the climactic showdown in Scotland. The film's score, composed by Thomas Newman, perfectly complements the on-screen action and adds another layer to the film's overall appeal.\n\nThe screenplay, written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan, is one of the strongest in the series. It delves into Bond's backstory, giving the audience a glimpse into the making of the man behind the spy. The dialogue is sharp and witty, with several memorable one-liners.\n\nHowever, what truly sets \"Skyfall\" apart is its exploration of themes such as loyalty, sacrifice, and the struggle to adapt in a world that is constantly evolving. It is a film that not only entertains but also makes you think, and that is a rare feat in the world of blockbuster cinema.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Skyfall\" is a must-watch for not just Bond fans, but for anyone who appreciates well-crafted cinema. It is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, and is a testament to the enduring appeal of the James Bond franchise.",
    "\"Jackie\" is a deeply moving and intimate exploration of one of the most tragic events in American history, seen through the eyes of the iconic First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy. Natalie Portman delivers a career-defining performance, embodying the grace, poise, and inner turmoil of Jackie with an uncanny precision. Her portrayal is not just an impersonation but a deeply felt understanding of a woman thrust into unimaginable grief and public scrutiny.\n\nThe film's narrative structure, which oscillates between the immediate aftermath of JFK's assassination, a later interview with a journalist, and flashbacks to Jackie's televised White House tour, is both innovative and effective. It allows for a layered, non-linear exploration of Jackie's psyche, making the film as much a character study as it is a historical drama.\n\nDirector Pablo Larraín's decision to shoot on 16mm film lends a grainy, vintage aesthetic that enhances the period authenticity. The close-up shots are particularly striking, often lingering on Portman's face, capturing every flicker of emotion. Mica Levi's haunting score, meanwhile, underscores the film's melancholic tone, evoking a sense of unease and disorientation that mirrors Jackie's emotional state.\n\n\"Jackie\" is not a conventional biopic. It does not attempt to encapsulate its subject's entire life but instead focuses on a pivotal moment that defined her. It's a bold, unflinching look at grief, legacy, and the burdens of public life. Some may find its pace slow and its approach too introspective, but for those willing to engage with its meditative rhythm, \"Jackie\" offers a rich, emotionally resonant cinematic experience.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Jackie\" is a beautifully crafted film that offers a fresh perspective on a familiar historical event. It's a testament to the power of cinema to humanize figures often relegated to the pages of history books. Natalie Portman's performance is nothing short of extraordinary, and the film itself is a poignant, thought-provoking piece of art.",
    "Stanley Kubrick has proved his mastery in movie-making with the intense psychological thriller, 'The Shining' . The film, based on Stephen King's hard-hitting novel of the same name, exhibits a spine-chilling narrative and characters that tug at the darkest corners of your fears.\n\nJack Nicholson as Jack Torrance has delivered a career-defining performance, perfecting the mannerisms of a deranged mind enthralled by sinister forces. His transition from a loving husband and father to a man possessed by his own demons is layered and entrancing. Shelley Duvall, playing Wendy Torrance, portrays the terrified wife and mother with such raw and harrowing emotion that it becomes impossible not to empathize with her.\n\nKubrick’s directorial stylings are on top form, turning the Overlook Hotel, with its unsettling maze-like corridors, into a symbol of mental unraveling, capturing the essence of claustrophobia and isolation. The musical score is ominous in the most skin-crawling way, creating a mood of constant foreboding that complements the narrative.\n\nThe camera work is truly inventive, grabbing close-ups of Nicholson's deranged facial expressions and wide-angle shots of the hedged maze and desolate hotel, to cultivate unmitigated horror. It is the labyrinth-style shooting and Kubrick's uncanny ability to create suspense that sets 'The Shining' apart from the conventional horror film genre.\n\nThat being said, 'The Shining' is not for the faint-hearted. It drifts from the generally formulaic horror storytelling and dips into the profound psychological horror, a mind game often left unexplored in mainstream Hollywood.\n\nSubtle metaphors and allegories peppered throughout the narrative require a keen eye and a propensity for looking beyond the obvious. In essence, the film challenges you to think and in doing so, takes you on a grotesque journey inwards to the recesses of your own mind. Hence, it may not appeal to those seeking a simple, straightforward scare.\n\nIn conclusion, while 'The Shining' is slow-burning, it retains warmth in its artistic depiction of psychological distress and downright horror. Kubrick, with his brilliant camera work, aesthetically pleasing visual narrative, and dramatic performances by A-list actors, has created a timeless masterpiece. 'The Shining' transcends the traditional format of horror movies to create an art house genre fueled by suspense, fear, and deep understanding of humanity's darkest capabilities.",

Their whirlwind romance, filled with fascination and trouble, is the very essence of this vibrant cinematic experience. The storyline takes the viewer through graphic but tastefully crafted bouts of extreme violence leading to a skillfully executed climax that stays with you long after the credits roll.\n\nA large part of the movie's charm can be tied to the striking performances of its leading actors. Both Slater and Arquette fit perfectly into their characters, both as individuals and as a couple. Their on-screen chemistry is both palpable and infectious, transforming their unlikely love story into something extraordinarily heart-warming.\n\nThe ensemble cast, including veteran actors like Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, and Brad Pitt in a surprisingly hilarious performance, are exceptionally utilized. Each character is etched out brilliantly, no matter how brief their screen time is, and contributes significantly in creating the setting and tone of the film.\n\nTony Scott presents \"True Romance\" with a healthy dose of stylistic flair. His signature rapid-fire editing and aptly constructed shots create an immersive, addictive atmosphere that is hard to resist. The musical score is the icing on the cake, underscoring moments of tension and passion and infusing the film with a slick, unique energy.\n\nBut the heart of \"True Romance\" belongs to Quentin Tarantino. The script, ripe with his distinctive dialogue and narrative style, is proof of Tarantino's mastery as a storyteller. Despite being a fledgling screenwriter at the time, he managed to pen a story that is as engaging as it is heartrending and manages to keep the suspense alive until the very end.\n\nOn the surface, \"True Romance\" may seem like just another violent love story, but it truly delivers a cinematic experience like no other. It's wild, brutal, hilarious, and touching all at the same time - complete with some unforgettable performances, and a love story that beats at its core.

    "\"The Runaways\" is a raw, gritty, and unapologetic portrayal of the rise and fall of the 1970s all-girl rock band of the same name. The film is a rollercoaster ride of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, capturing the essence of the rebellious spirit of the era.\n\nThe performances are the highlight of the film. Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning, who play Joan Jett and Cherie Currie respectively, deliver powerful performances that are both vulnerable and fierce. They embody their characters with such conviction that it's easy to forget you're watching a movie and not a documentary. Michael Shannon, as the eccentric and manipulative manager Kim Fowley, is equally impressive, adding a layer of dark humor to the film.\n\nThe film's narrative is unflinching in its depiction of the exploitation and struggles the band faced. It doesn't shy away from showing the darker side of fame, which is both its strength and weakness. While it's commendable for its honesty, the film can feel a bit too chaotic and disjointed at times, making it hard to fully connect with the characters.\n\nThe soundtrack is another standout, filled with classic rock anthems that perfectly encapsulate the rebellious spirit of the band and the era. It's a nostalgic trip down memory lane for those familiar with the music of the time.\n\n\"The Runaways\" is not a perfect film, but it's a compelling one. It's a raw and honest look at the music industry and the price of fame. It's a tribute to a band that broke barriers and paved the way for future generations of female rockers.

With the two princess sisters, Elsa and Anna at the heart of its narrative, the movie beautifully explores the theme of love, fear, acceptance and the complex dynamics of sisterhood.\n\nWhere other princess tales focus predominantly on the romantic affection between a prince and a princess, Frozen ingeniously deviates from this formulaic narrative by showcasing the love between two sisters. Elsa's journey from a fearful, isolated figure to a self-accepting, powerful woman is beautifully contrasted with Anna's ferocious loyalty and unwavering hope, offering an inspiring message for younger viewers.

    "\"Coach Carter\" is a powerful sports drama that succinctly encapsulates what it means to be a team, not just on the court but in life as well. A riveting rendition of true events, the story is centered around Ken Carter, a high school basketball coach at a disadvantageous Californian school who, undeterred by the system, resolves to transform the lives of his players.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson delivers a spellbinding performance as Coach Carter, imparting an exhilarating intensity and adamant sincerity to the role that only a veteran actor of his caliber could master. His moving portrait of Carter embodies the stark reality of a resilient man striving against all odds to inculcate values of discipline, persistence, and education amongst his players.

    "\"Titanic\" is a cinematic triumph that successfully merges two intense narratives: one historical and one fictional. It is a tragic yet compelling exploration of human love and loss against the backdrop of the ill-fated voyage of the Titanic. \n\nDirector James Cameron has masterfully woven together a profound love story between two characters, Jack Dawson (a steadfastly charming Leonardo DiCaprio), a third-class yet free-spirited artist, and Rose DeWitt-Bukater (an irresistibly enchanting Kate Winslet), a first-class lady entrapped in a constricting societal cage.

The film's haunting and iconic score by James Horner enhances the movie’s overall impact and leaves an indelible impression on the viewer's mind. Cameron's meticulous attention to detail while recreating the historic event is a testament to his expertise and vision as a film-maker.\n\nHowever, the movie is not without its flaws. Some parts of the narrative feel stretched while others seem hurried. Despite that, the poignant ending wraps up the movie beautifully, leaving the audience teary-eyed and touched.\n\nIn summary, Titanic is a grand spectacle of love and disaster, stirring emotions of exhilarating joy, transcendent love, and debilitating sorrow.

    "\"Beasts of No Nation\" is a potent, eye-opening exploration of child soldiers in war-torn Africa- a piercing illustration culled from a sea of grim reality. The indisputable heart of this narrative is young Agu, played exceptionally by Abraham Attah, whose journey from innocence to darker depths is strikingly portrayed- an acting prowess that commands every frame he graces.\n\nIdris Elba delivers an equally formidable performance as the Commandant, embodying the charm and menace of his character with a chilling conviction. His hold over the young war recruits reveals the harrowing manipulation these children are subjected to, transforming them into instruments of war.\n\nDirector Cary Joji Fukunaga resists the temptation to glamorize or sensationalize the subject matter. From the vibrant greens of a lost childhood, he guides us into the harsh browns and blood reds of Agu's reality. Yet, he never loses sight of the human faces in this conflict, fencing the narrative in a way that it is the characters and their journey, not the war, that remain at the forefront.\n\nAt its core, \"Beasts of No Nation\" is a hauntingly nuanced exploration of innocence lost, war, and the remnants of humanity within desolation. The stomach-churning combat scenes provide a window into a horrifying world, yet, such a world is consumed with a raw emotional depth that goes beyond just the physical.\n\nAgu's voice-over--which threads through the narrative like an unwelcome reminder of his lost childhood--is poetic and poignant.

Agu's story lives on, bearing the flag for millions of children drowned in the monstrous sea of war, waiting to be seen, heard, and rescued.\n\nAll in all, \"Beasts of No Nation\" is a film that is as challenging to watch as it is necessary.

    "\"Get Him to the Greek\" is a surprisingly amusing ride that succeeds in capturing the extravagant and unpredictable world of rock and roll whilst giving us some solid laugh-out-loud moments. This wacky comedy revolves around a beleaguered record company intern, Aaron Green, commendably portrayed by Jonah Hill, who is assigned the herculean task of escorting the unconventional British rock star, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), to his concert at Los Angeles' Greek Theater.\n\nRussell Brand steals the show as an obnoxious caricature of a washed-up rock star, a character he had previously delved into in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\" He brings a unique charisma to his role, making Aldous a hard-to-hate mess of egoistic charm and vulnerability. Meanwhile, Jonah Hill mastered his character's panicked, shell-shocked reactions that serve as a fantastic contrast to Brand's brash eccentricity.\n\nThe dialogue in \"Get Him to the Greek\" is sharp, witty, and most importantly, funny. However, the film goes beyond mere laughs, incorporating a strong emotional core. Amid the raucous debauchery and amusing slapstick sequences, the narrative navigates the messy world of addiction and the pressure of fame, lending depth to the otherwise boisterous screenplay.\n\nDespite the steady stream of laughs, some viewers might not appreciate the film's occasional dips into raunchy humor. The crude jokes sometimes go overboard and can feel gratuitous, potentially treading on viewer comfort sensitivities.\n\nAdding to the magic is the stellar supporting cast, which includes Elisabeth Moss, Rose Byrne, and a hilarious turn by Sean Combs as the foul-mouthed record executive. The numerous celebrity cameos peppered throughout the film keep the narrative engaging and fresh.\n\nOverall, \"Get Him to the Greek\" serves up a cocktail of debauchery and heart, mixed with thunderous rock and solid performances. It combines outrageous comedic scenes with touches of unexpected sentimentality, defining it as more than your average comedic flick. While it undeniably strays into vulgar humor, it remains an entertaining exploration of the rock and roll lifestyle from a unique perspective, making it a worthwhile watch.",

Jean Dujardin delivers a captivating performance as George Valentin, perfectly capturing the charm and charisma of a silent film star.

Cohen, as the pretentious French F1 driver, provides an interesting counterpoint to Ferrell's character, while Adams showcases her diverse talent, thus standing as more than just a complementary piece in the narrative.\n\nThe script represents Ferrell and McKay at their wisecracking best. Their signature style of humor pervades throughout the movie, keeping the audience engaged in a seemingly unending loop of belly laughs. Despite a few predictable patches, the gag-filled plot moves along briskly and never really loses its momentum. \n\nA shining star in the field of absurd and slapstick humor, \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" leaves no NASCAR cliché unturned or unskewered. With its sharp-edged satire and top-notch performances, the movie is an absolute delight for those fond of Ferrell's trademark comedy.\n\nGiven the movie's comedy format, it does not aspire to be a profound exploration of human life, rather it provides the audience with a deluge of hearty laughs, all while cleverly satirizing American automotive sports culture. The humor might not appeal to all - it is brash, broad, and over-the-top. Nevertheless, those who embrace this brand of comedy will surely appreciate the mindless, light-hearted fun which this film delivers in abundance. To sum it up, \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is a wildly entertaining ride that cements Will Ferrell's status as a heavyweight in the comedy genre.",
    "\"Quantum of Solace\" continues the high-octane adventures of James Bond (Daniel Craig) in a manner that is both thrilling and deeply introspective. This film, the 22nd in the Bond franchise, is a direct sequel to \"Casino Royale\" and it does a commendable job of maintaining the momentum and intensity of its predecessor.\n\nDaniel Craig once again delivers a stellar performance as the iconic British spy. His portrayal of Bond is gritty, raw, and emotionally complex, a far cry from the suave and unflappable Bond of yesteryears. Craig's Bond is a man haunted by his past, wrestling with his demons, and yet, unyielding in his pursuit of justice.\n\nThe plot is intricate and layered, with a narrative that delves into the murky world of international espionage and corporate greed. The action sequences are breathtaking, with stunning cinematography that captures the chaos and beauty of the various exotic locales. The car chases, fight scenes, and daring stunts are executed with precision and flair, making for a truly exhilarating cinematic experience.\n\nHowever, \"Quantum of Solace\" is not without its flaws. The plot can be convoluted at times, with a few subplots that seem unnecessary and distracting. The villain, while adequately menacing, lacks the charisma and depth of some of the more memorable Bond antagonists.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Judi Dench as M and Olga Kurylenko as the Bond girl, deliver solid performances. The film's score, composed by David Arnold, is both evocative and stirring, perfectly complementing the film's tone and pace.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Quantum of Solace\" is a worthy addition to the Bond franchise. It may not be perfect, but it offers a darker, more nuanced exploration of the character of James Bond, while still delivering the thrilling action and intrigue that fans have come to expect. It's a must-watch for Bond aficionados and action movie enthusiasts alike.",
    "\"L.A. Confidential,\" directed by Curtis Hanson, is nothing short of a masterpiece. Set in the 1950s, it's a neo-noir crime film that manages to meticulously weave crime, corruption, scandal, and morality into a phenomenal cinematic tapestry.\n\nThe plot is intricate, brutal, and brilliantly executed, bringing to light the more sinister side of life through the eyes of three policemen who embody strikingly different perspectives and methods. The movie's narrative is driven not only by the complex plot but also by the in-depth character analysis—one of the film's most triumphant technical aspects.\n\nThe performances are nothing short of remarkable with a stellar ensemble cast that includes Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey. Each actor effectively portrays his character's emotional turmoils, moral dilemmas, and personality quirks. Particularly impressive is Kim Basinger, who provides a sublime performance as the Veronica Lake look-alike, Lynn Bracken. She embodies the vulnerability and strength of her character, turning her into more than just a beautiful facade.\n\n\"L.A. Confidential\" truly shines in its elaborate execution of its period setting. From clothing to dialogue, to the brilliantly designed set pieces, the authenticity of the era is stunning. Moreover, the cinematography is evocative and stylized, seamlessly blending the alluring glamour and the grim, sleazy underworld of Los Angeles.\n\nDespite its violent, gritty overtones, the movie does not rob itself of its witty dialogue and subtle humor, a welcome unexpected touch that adds depth to its characters while providing some relief for its audience. \n\nThe strikingly poignant and resonant finale is proof of how well-crafted the movie is. It doesn't offer any easy answers or clean resolutions but instead provides a riveting study of the moral complexities involved in seeking justice.\n\nIn all, \"L.A. Confidential\" is an epic and intelligent work of cinema, a compelling narrative spun against the backdrop of fascinatingly flawed characters that exist in a world painted with shades of grey. It is an astonishing film, a rare gem in the realm of neo-noir, that deserves every bit of acclaim it has received.\"",
    "Quentin Tarantino's \"Django Unchained\" is undeniably a bold and audacious slice of cinematic artistry that bristles with the director's signature stylings - characterized by his knack for cleverly reinventing genres. This epic Western is no different, heavily laden with classic Tarantino tropes: hyper-violence, idiosyncratic characters, unique narrative style, and a carefully curated soundtrack.\n\n\"Django Unchained\" tells the epic tale of a freed slave-turned-bounty hunter, seamlessly played by Jamie Foxx, who embarks on a mission to rescue his wife from a ruthless plantation owner. Foxx's portrayal of Django perfectly balances severity and vulnerability, crafting a character that is both stoic and deeply empathetic. \n\nAt the side of Foxx shines the ever-talented Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz, a bounty hunter who serves as both mentor and ally to Django. Waltz brings his usual air of charm and sardonic wit, creating a character that is strange, compelling, and wonderfully eccentric. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of the villainous plantation owner, Calvin Candie, is nothing short of impressive. He effortlessly captures the vile essence of his character, infusing it with a chilling charisma.\n\nWhile the movie delves into the grotesque and brutal realities of slavery, it never loses its dark sense of humor. Tarantino's script is full of sharp, snappy dialogues that make even horrific situations engrossing. However, the violence and sharp racial slurs could be off-putting to some audience members, so discretion is advised.\n\n\"Django Unchained\" is visually stunning, with Robert Richardson's cinematography capturing the sprawling landscapes and the grim interiors of plantation-era America. Every shot is crafted with meticulous care and style, making the movie a visual feast. Tarantino's eclectic soundtrack is another masterstroke, mixing classics, forgotten gems, and original music to enhance the intense emotions of the story. \n\nIn conclusion, \"Django Unchained\" is a merciless yet humorous examination of America's dark past, packed with outstanding performances, bold storytelling, and Tarantino's typical panache. Though not for everyone, this film is unquestionably an example of modern filmmaking at its most bold and fearless.",
    "\"Lifeboat\", a 1944 film noir classic directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock, is a gripping tale of survival, preconceptions, and conflict. Hitchcock manages to orchestrate a complex narrative within the confined space of a lifeboat adrift in the North Atlantic Ocean which narrates the disparate lives of nine shipwreck survivors during World War II.\n\nThe film rotates around the interactions of these diverse characters, each representing a cross-section of society. Their collective struggle for survival leads to catalyzing developments, internal struggles, human drama, and exposes the interplay of power dynamics. \n\nHitchcock's decision to shoot this film entirely on a lifeboat is an artistic gamble that pays off tremendously, adding to the intensity and claustrophobia. The characters have no escape from each other and their harsh reality, allowing for an atmospheric pressure cooker situation that relentlessly builds tension.\n\nThe performances are stellar across the board particularly, Tallulah Bankhead as a cynical journalist, and Walter Slezak as a Nazi U-boat captain. Each character is meticulously realized, and their arcs are well-crafted, making every dialogue and gesture significant.\n\nWhat sets this film apart is its philosophical exploration of morality and humanity under severe duress. Characters navigate through deep-seated prejudices, ethical dilemmas, and their survival instincts, resulting in a microcosm of war, conflict, and the human condition.\n\nTechnically, the cinematography is admirable given the limited space and resources. The use of shadows and strategic lighting accentuates the mood, suspense, and overall drama. The screenplay is smart, brisk, and thought-provoking with a subtle undercurrent of dark humor, another trademark of Hitchcock's storytelling.\n\nIn summary, \"Lifeboat\" is an intricately woven drama that is as relentless as it is brilliant. As a metaphor for war and a study of human nature, it is exceedingly rich in both its sardonic wit and profound implications. One may find it slightly implausible that such a riveting narrative could emerge from the restricted space of a small boat - but that is the genius of Hitchcock.",
    "The Wolf of Wall Street is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the true story of Jordan Belfort – magnificently portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio – a stockbroker whose fraudulent practices led to his downfall. \n\nDirector Martin Scorsese displays his filmmaking prowess in this over-the-top depiction of Belfort's life of debauchery, greed, and unfathomable wealth. The film presents a fast-paced, manic energy that suits Belfort's lifestyle, highlighting the pervasive corruption in 1980s Wall Street, yet never losing sight of the inherently pitiable state of its key players. \n\nDiCaprio truly shines, delivering one of the best performances of his career. He brilliantly captures the complexities of Belfort – his charisma, intelligence, audacity, and underlying emptiness. Future generations of actors could take notes on DiCaprio's commitment to the character and his immersive performance.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally impressive, with Jonah Hill's Donnie Azoff standing out with his delightful, hilarious, but equally tragic performance. Margot Robbie, as Belfort's wife, showcases her talent and versatility in the role of a woman caught in the wild ride, offering a profound portrayal of glamour laced with despair.\n\nThe movie calls upon an interesting blend of humor and drama, providing amusement whilst underlining the grim reality of the story. Its audacious, at times shocking, depiction of Wall Street shenanigans is a testament to Scorsese’s daring filmmaking style. Though some scenes border on the absurd, they perfectly echo the story's overall theme of excess.\n\nHowever, The Wolf of Wall Street is not a film for the faint-hearted. Clocking in at three hours, the exhilarating ride it offers is punctuated by explicit content and instances of vulgarity, which may unsettle certain viewers. \n\nIn spite of this, the film is an eye-opening exploration of decadence, deception, and the toll the relentless pursuit of wealth can have on the human soul. Scorsese's poignant storytelling combined with DiCaprio's powerhouse performance make The Wolf of Wall Street a must-watch movie that leaves viewers with much to ponder. \n\nAs with any investment, your return is based on what you're willing to put in, and this indelible cinematic experience will positively yield dividends in awe, humor, and sheer entertainment. Do invest with caution, though —like its dubious protagonists, this movie can be both wildly intoxicating and unsettling in almost equal measure.",
    "\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" deftly juggles its expansive ensemble cast and melds various timelines into a cohesive and intriguing storyline. This is a spectacular exercise of tension, character interplay, and imaginative storytelling.\n\nLet's talk about the cast, which is a standout. Old players like Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen deliver their performances with nuanced subtlety and gravitas that one feels an emotional connection with their characters. More than anything, it's great to see these actors reprise these beloved roles. Meanwhile, new additions such as James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence bring energy and depth to their characters and it's fascinating to see a fresher take on their complex personalities. What’s truly amazing is how smoothly the ensemble was handled - each character gets their moment in the spotlight, making for a satisfying cinematic experience.\n\nThe narrative is intricate without being confusing. The seamless interweaving of past and future provides a pace that is fast yet coherent, and the plot itself balances emotion and action. This is not a simple tale of good vs evil - it is a story where motivation, belief, and consequence play central roles. The contemplative dialogue keeps the audience engaged and invested in the trajectory of our heroes.\n\nVisual effects in the movie are magnificent. From the detailed set designs of the 1970s era to the intricate costumes, everything is meticulously executed. Impressive are the action sequences - none of them feel gratuitous, each fight scene serving to further the plot or character development.\n\nNo review should omit John Ottman's score, which amplifies the emotional resonance throughout the film, whether it's an action-packed sequence or a quiet dialogue moment.\n\nHowever, the movie is not without its flaws. Some characters lack depth and were underutilized, but given the ambitious size of the ensemble, it's a forgiveable offense.\n\nOverall, \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" is a triumph. It stunningly achieves what it sets out to do, mixing elements of science fiction, action, drama, and even a touch of comedy. It's an amazing delight to watch, not just for X-Men fans but for the audience at large. A perfect blend of powerful performances, a superb storyline, and outstanding visual pizzazz; it's a thrilling spectacle with profound emotional depth.",
    "\"The Longest Yard,\" directed by Peter Segal, is a fun-filled remake that manages to balance the realms of comedy and American Football while adding an intriguing twist of prison life. The film showcases Adam Sandler's acting versatility as we watch him transition from swindled, drunk NFL player to convicted felon to reluctant Football coach for his fellow inmates.\n\nThe supporting cast is absolutely magnificent. The star-studded cast, including Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds, brilliantly complements Sandler's charismatic performance, adding depth to the narrative. Burt Reynolds, who was a part of the original 1974 film, makes this movie nostalgic and worth watching. Every character is uniquely crafted, and their quirks and personalities make you connect and root for each of them. \n\nOne of the film's highlights is the stunning action-packed football scenes. The director captures football's adrenaline-fueled nature, making the audience feel like they're right there on the field. The game sequences are orchestrated perfectly with humor, making this film hilariously engaging.\n\nBut the film isn't all laughs and sports; there's an underlying theme of redemption and self-discovery. Each of the prison inmates battles their own demons and past mistakes while forming an unconventional brotherhood, highlighting the potential for camaraderie and unity even in bleak circumstances.\n\nHowever, the film's narrative can be predictable at times, and the humor borders on crass. Additionally, the depiction of prison life is highly glamorized, which might seem unrealistic and may not appeal to everyone's taste.\n\nNonetheless, the film's overall appeal lies in its brilliant blend of humor, action, and heart. The snappy one-liners, football action, and the outstanding performances by the cast make \"The Longest Yard\" an entertaining watch. It's a movie that one can enjoy on a lazy Sunday afternoon from the comfort of their couch. Despite its shortcomings, it is an enjoyable feel-good film for Sandler fans and football enthusiasts.",
    "\"Da 5 Bloods\" is a powerful and poignant film that delves into the heart of the Vietnam War and its aftermath. Directed by the legendary Spike Lee, the film is a masterful blend of drama, action, and history that leaves a lasting impression.\n\nThe narrative follows four African-American veterans who return to Vietnam in search of their fallen squad leader's remains and a treasure they buried during the war. The plot is layered and complex, exploring themes of brotherhood, trauma, racial tension, and the lasting impact of war. The film's non-linear storytelling, which includes flashbacks to the war, adds depth and context to the characters' present-day journey.\n\nThe performances are exceptional across the board. Delroy Lindo, in particular, delivers a tour-de-force performance as Paul, a man haunted by his past and grappling with PTSD. His raw and emotional portrayal is heart-wrenching and deserves recognition. The rest of the cast, including Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis, and Isiah Whitlock Jr., also deliver strong performances, creating a believable bond of camaraderie and shared history.\n\nSpike Lee's direction is, as always, top-notch. He skillfully balances the film's intense action sequences with quieter, more introspective moments. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the lush Vietnamese landscapes and the gritty realities of war with equal finesse. The film's score, a mix of Marvin Gaye songs and original compositions by Terence Blanchard, adds another layer of emotion to the narrative.\n\n\"Da 5 Bloods\" is not just a war film. It's a commentary on the African-American experience, the cost of war, and the struggle for racial justice. It's a film that demands your attention and stays with you long after the credits roll. Despite its nearly 2.5-hour runtime, it never feels too long, thanks to its engaging storyline and compelling performances.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Da 5 Bloods\" is a must-watch. It's a testament to Spike Lee's storytelling prowess and a powerful exploration of themes that are as relevant today as they were during the Vietnam War. Whether you're a fan of war films, character-driven dramas, or historical narratives, this film has something to offer.",
    "\"Cinderella Man\" is a compelling, heartwarming tale of resilience, determination, and the human spirit. Set against the backdrop of the Great Depression, the film tells the true story of James J. Braddock, a washed-up boxer who makes an incredible comeback to become a symbol of hope for a nation in despair.\n\nRussell Crowe delivers a knockout performance as Braddock, embodying the character's grit and tenacity with a raw, emotional intensity that is nothing short of captivating. His portrayal of Braddock's unwavering dedication to his family and his sport, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, is both inspiring and deeply moving.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally impressive. Renée Zellweger shines as Braddock's steadfast wife, Mae, and Paul Giamatti delivers a standout performance as Braddock's loyal manager, Joe Gould. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, lending authenticity to the relationships and heightening the emotional stakes of the narrative.\n\nDirector Ron Howard masterfully captures the bleakness of the Depression era, juxtaposing the grim reality of the Braddock family's struggle for survival with the glitz and glamour of the boxing world. The fight scenes are expertly choreographed and shot, creating a visceral, immersive experience that leaves you on the edge of your seat.\n\nHowever, \"Cinderella Man\" is more than just a sports movie. It's a poignant exploration of the human condition, a testament to the power of hope and the indomitable spirit of the underdog. It's a story about fighting - not just in the ring, but for one's family, one's dignity, and one's place in the world.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Cinderella Man\" is a cinematic triumph - a beautifully crafted, emotionally resonant film that packs a powerful punch. It's a must-see for fans of sports dramas and anyone who appreciates a good, old-fashioned tale of triumph against all odds.",
    "\"12 Angry Men\" is a timeless masterpiece that refuses to fade into obscurity. More than just a simple courtroom drama, it is an intense exploration of human character and a penetrating, often uncomfortable look at the American system of justice. The movie is a riveting interactive study on how personal prejudices, preconceived notions, and blind stubbornness can impact justice.\n\nDirected by Sidney Lumet and presented in the stark black and white cinematography of the 1950s, the movie takes place almost entirely within the confines of a single, sweaty room, where twelve jurors decide the fate of a defendant in a murder case. Despite the limited setting, the narrative never feels dull or claustrophobic, partially due to the brilliant character development and the enthralling performances of its ensemble cast.\n\nEach man, representing an assortment of backgrounds and attitudes, is given a chance to shine, and all the actors make the most of their respective moments under the spotlight. Chief among them is Henry Fonda, whose calm and level-headed Juror 8 provides a stark contrast to the hot-headed Juror 3, played brilliantly by Lee J. Cobb.\n\nThe script by Reginald Rose is a masterpiece of tension and conflict. Despite the unanimous decision needed for the jury to reach a verdict, viewers are introduced to differing perspectives, biases, and fallacies existing within the group. Each man's judgments reveal more about his own character than the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\n\n\"12 Angry Men\" is nothing short of a thought-provoking, tension-filled lesson in storytelling. It exquisitely illustrates how differing views cause friction, how people are quick to judge based on appearance and background, and how truth can be a matter of perspective. This film not only stands the test of time but remains a piercing and relevant comment on the flaws of our legal system and the nature of humanity itself.",
    "\"Alexander\" is an ambitious epic that attempts to recount the life story of one of history's most revered military strategists, Alexander the Great. Oliver Stone, the director, is known for his adventurous spirit when it comes to filmmaking, and this is evident in \"Alexander\". The film indeed features stunning battle scenes, copious historical details and it does a commendable job of portrayering the grandeur of the ancient world.\n\nHowever, the film stumbles as it fails to create a cogent narrative, resulting in it being disappointingly less than the sum of its parts. The dialogue sometimes seems overwritten and the characters aren't developed as thoroughly as one might expect in a film of this magnitude.\n\nColin Farrell, as Alexander, delivers a spirited performance and brings an admirable level of intensity to his character. However, he doesn’t quite successfully convey the strategic genius and charisma that Alexander the Great was renowned for. The supporting cast is good, with solid performances from Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and Jared Leto, but what they can do is also limited by the script.\n\nVisually, \"Alexander\" is spectacular with its majestic set designs and detailed costumes that effectively portray the era. The film’s cinematography is strikingly beautiful along with its heart-pounding battle sequences that are depicted in brutal detail. Despite all this, \"Alexander\" can seem overlong and a bit verbose with its 175-minute running time, leading to certain parts feeling drawn out and tedious.\n\nThe movie, while a grand spectacle, lacks a solid narrative and strong character development imperative for a historical figure as complex as Alexander. In trying to cover so many aspects of his life, the movie loses sight of what makes a compelling biopic: a clear storyline, immersive characters and a closer look into the protagonist’s psyche. With less focus on the spectacle and some more on the intricacies of Alexander's character, the film might have been a triumph. Nonetheless, for history buffs and fans of epic war sequences, \"Alexander\" might still be worth a watch.",
    "\"The Machinist\" is a uniquely engrossing film that embodies a blend of psychological thriller and noir drama. Christian Bale delivers an exceptionally versatile and captivating performance, arguably one of his best to date. His physical transformation into the emaciated and insomniac character, Trevor Reznik, is nothing short of jaw-dropping. This level of dedication to character portrayal brings an authentically haunting and tragic element to the film.\n\nThe movie itself thrives on atmosphere, aided by director Brad Anderson's deft handling of the bleak and unsettling mise-en-scene. The grim, desaturated environments and eerie industrial soundscape pull you into Trevor's world, a world devoid of rest, plagued by paranoia.\n\n\"The Machinist\" is a masterfully puzzling narrative that delves into the psychological unrest of the protagonist’s disintegrating mind, augmented by subtle clues, shadowy figures, and cryptic messages. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Aitana Sánchez-Gijón provide commendable performances, forming a perplexing entourage around Bale's character.\n\nAt its core, \"The Machinist\" is about guilt, a deep-buried emotion that eats away sanity and leads towards a path of inexorable self-destruction. The screenplay by Scott Kosar is brilliantly intricate and harbors deeper interpretations along with a mind-bending climactic revelation.\n\nDespite its bleak and distressing narrative, \"The Machinist\" is undeniably a thought-provoking piece of cinema that successfully does what it sets out to do - which is to unsettle and intrigue, making it a must-watch for fans of psychological thrillers. The satisfaction lies in unraveling the complex narrative knotted around Trevor’s distorted realities and the profound human emotion of guilt. \n\nAll in all, \"The Machinist\" is a vividly daunting cinematic experience encompassing excellent performances, crisp direction, an intriguing plot, and a haunting score that lingers long after the screen fades to black.",
    "\"Cold Mountain\" is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly intertwines the brutality of the American Civil War with a timeless love story. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman's performances are emotionally captivating, investing you into every moment of their characters, Inman and Ada’s, respective journeys. The ongoing tension, sustained even through their separation, keeps your heart enthralled for the entirety of the film.\n\nAnthony Minghella’s direction is commendable. His ability to narrate a love story amidst the backdrop of war is a testament to his storytelling abilities. Every shot in this movie is notably breathtaking, from the panoramic scenes of the Carolina mountain ranges, to the grueling, gritty battlegrounds. The film masterfully embraces elements of nature and utilizes them to guide the storyline, granting us a substantial piece of both the beauty and brutality of the Civil War era.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Renée Zellweger in an Oscar-winning role, contributes significantly to the emotional depth of the film. Each character they portray helps build up the horrifying reality of war, homefront hardship, and the human struggle for connection. \n\nThe musical score is another high point, enhancing the storytelling with a captivating mix of melancholy melodies and uplifting tunes. It's deeply organic and grounded in its use of Appalachian folk roots, intensifying the authenticity of the film’s period setting.\n\nThe main criticism one could make about \"Cold Mountain\" pertains to its length. The movie requires a commitment due to its running time of 154 minutes, but the payoff is well worth it. Hailed by some as an adaptation of 'The Odyssey', it is no small feat keeping audiences engaged during this epic journey of Law’s character back to his beloved.\n\nDespite this, \"Cold Mountain\" is not just another war film or love story, it's a rich and epic tale of survival, longing, loss, and redemption. It tugs on the heartstrings and makes us question our own morality and willingness to endure in the face of adversity. A must-watch for all cinematic buffs.",

    "Gustave Schlumberger (17 October 1844 – 9 May 1929) was a French historian and numismatist who specialized in the era of the crusades and the Byzantine Empire. His extensive travels, prolific writings, and influential interpretations have left an indelible mark on the study of medieval history, making him one of the most respected figures in his field.\n\nSchlumberger was born in Guebwiller, Haut-Rhin, the third child in a family of textile manufacturers. He studied literature and law at Collège Sainte-Barbe and later received his doctorate in law in 1869 from the University of Heidelberg. Despite this legal training, his real passion was history and he devoted much of his life to its study.\n\nHe is most famous for his work on the history of the Crusades, but he began his career studying ancient coinage. His skills as a numismatist were highly respected, and his work refined our understanding of the economic life of the Byzantine and Crusader periods. His book, \"Numismatic of the Middle Age\" (1872), remains a classic in the field.\n\nSchlumberger's major historical work was the multi-volume \"Crusader and Byzantine Studies\" (1890–1905). In this work, Schlumberger sought to document not only the history of the Crusades but also the day-to-day life of the Byzantine Empire, making use of his profound knowledge of numismatics to enrich his narrative. Such was the stature of this work that it has been translated into several languages and is still in print today.\n\nAside from his academic work, Schlumberger was a deeply committed citizen and took part in public affairs. He served in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, in which he was injured, and was awarded the Legion of Honor for his services to France. He was also involved in Red Cross during the Balkan War and the First World War, which further elevated his already high profile.\n\nA fierce proponent of the French colonial enterprise, Schlumberger supported the colonial policies of the Third Republic, especially with regard to Algeria. He himself travelled widely in the Middle East, Greece, and Turkey, often to conduct historical research. These travels greatly influenced his historical perspectives, especially his interpretation of the Byzantine and Muslim worlds.\n\nSchlumberger died in Paris in 1929, leaving a legacy of scholarship that continues to influence the study of medieval history. Many of his works still",

    "Spatial–temporal reasoning, also known as spatio-temporal reasoning, refers to the cognitive ability to visualize and manipulate patterns in both space and time. This form of reasoning enables a person to understand the relationships between different objects within a given area and their changes over time.\n\nSpatial-temporal reasoning is crucial in several complex cognitive tasks, including navigation, understanding causal systems, and predicting future events. It allows us to comprehend everyday activities, such as realizing that your car needs gas when the fuel gauge shows empty, or understanding how the changing of seasons affects the environment.\n\n=== Cognitive Development and Spatial-Temporal Reasoning ===\n\nSpatial-temporal reasoning begins to develop during early childhood and continues to mature throughout adolescence. It is the foundation for the development of various cognitive skills, including mathematical skills and problem-solving abilities. Several studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between spatial-temporal reasoning and achievement in mathematics, especially in areas such as geometry and algebra.\n\n=== Spatial-Temporal Reasoning in Different Fields ===\n\nMany fields of study and occupations require a degree of spatial-temporal reasoning. For instance, in computer science, it is used in artificial intelligence research to develop algorithms for solving problems. It is also essential in geographical information systems (GIS), where geographical changes are evaluated over a certain period.\n\nIn the field of Medicine, doctors use spatial-temporal reasoning when diagnosing patients based on their symptoms' progress over time. Architects and urban planners rely on it to design buildings and city layouts that will accommodate future growth and change.\n\n=== Training and Enhancing Spatial-Temporal Abilities === \n\nDespite being an hereditary trait to some extent, spatial-temporal reasoning abilities can be enhanced through specific training. Various strategies have been proposed, ranging from games and puzzles to more formal educational approaches. For example, research has demonstrated that learning to play a musical instrument can enhance one's spatial-temporal abilities.\n\nIn recent years, digital programs–often presented as games–have been developed to target spatial-temporal reasoning abilities specifically. As the importance of this cognitive skill is increasingly recognized, efforts to foster its development from early ages are expected to expand. \n\nTo sum up, spatial-temporal reasoning is a significant cognitive ability that affects our daily lives, including various academic and professional areas. Its enhancement can lead to improved problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and overall cognitive development.",

    "The Rio Ruidoso is a small river that stretches across 30 miles in the U.S. state of New Mexico. Although it is relatively short, the river is an iconic part of the landscape in the region, playing a key role in biodiversity, irrigation, and other forms of agriculture. Additionally, due to its serene beauty, the Rio Ruidoso has become a notable attraction for tourists and locals alike.\n\nThe Rio Ruidoso conveniently starts from the Sierra Blanca Mountains. Up in the mountains, the snow melts and pools together into a stream, which ultimately feeds into the river. The Rio Ruidoso then cuts through Ruidoso— a village in Lincoln County that took its name from the river—before it finally drains into the Rio Hondo. Its name Rio Ruidoso translates to \"noisy river\" in Spanish, aptly describing the bubbling sounds of its waters.\n\nThe river is home to diverse flora and fauna including a variety of fish species like rainbow trout and catfish, which makes it an ideal spot for fishing. Vegetation on the river banks primarily consists of willows, cottonwood trees, and an array of flowering plants. These contribute heavily to the scenic beauty that the river is celebrated for. Additionally, on a larger scale, the river provides a significant water source for the local ecology.\n\nRich in cultural history, the Apache tribe once settled along this river. They utilized its waters for agriculture and believed it to be a spiritual site. The Rio Ruidoso area is also intertwined with American history, as it witnessed notable events in the Lincoln County War in the 19th century. \n\nModern-day Ruidoso hosts a myriad of recreational activities around the river. From serene riverside hikes in the summer to adrenaline-inducing skiing trips in the mountains during winter, the Rio Ruidoso is an integral part of local tourism in all seasons. Birdwatching, wildlife spotting, and camping on its banks are other beloved activities amongst visitors.\n\nDespite its fame, Rio Ruidoso faces environmental challenges including erosion, persistent drought conditions, and occasional wildfires. Local NGOs and government bodies are actively involved in conservation efforts to preserve the biodiversity and ecological health of the river.\n\nIn conclusion, the Rio Ruidoso is not just a geographical feature in New Mexico; it an integral part of the local ecology, the cultural identity, the history, and the lifestyle of the people in Ruidoso, making it a treasure to be maintained and cherished.",

    "Enamelin is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and development of dental enamel, the hard, outermost layer of teeth. It is one of the key components involved in the biomineralization process, which is responsible for the formation of enamel crystals. \n\nEnamelin is encoded by the ENAM gene in humans. Mutations in this gene have been associated with conditions such as amelogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition that causes defects in tooth enamel. \n\nEnamelin is predominantly expressed during the secretory stage of amelogenesis, the process by which enamel is formed. It is secreted by ameloblasts, the cells responsible for enamel formation. Once secreted, enamelin helps to initiate the mineralization process and controls the growth and organization of enamel crystals. \n\nThe protein is initially produced as a large precursor molecule, known as proenamelin. This precursor is then processed into smaller, active enamelin fragments. The exact mechanism by which this processing occurs is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the action of specific enzymes.\n\nEnamelin is unique to tooth enamel and is not found in any other tissues in the body. It is one of the most highly mineralized tissues in the body, with a mineral content of over 95%. This high mineral content gives enamel its hardness and strength, making it capable of withstanding the forces of chewing and biting.\n\nDespite its importance in tooth development, the function of enamelin is not fully understood. It is known to play a role in the initiation and growth of enamel crystals, but the exact mechanisms by which it does this are still being investigated. \n\nResearch into enamelin and its function could have important implications for dental health. Understanding how enamelin works could potentially lead to new treatments for conditions that affect tooth enamel, such as amelogenesis imperfecta. It could also lead to the development of new strategies for enamel repair and regeneration, which could have significant benefits for individuals with tooth decay or other forms of dental damage.\n\nIn conclusion, enamelin is a vital protein in the formation and development of dental enamel. While much is still unknown about its exact function and mechanisms, ongoing research continues to shed light on this important protein and its role in dental health.",

    "\"Mutiny!\" refers to a rebellion against proper authorities, particularly by soldiers or sailors against their officers. The term is often associated with a group's refusal to obey orders from, or even to overthrow, the leadership. Mutinies have occurred throughout history, often as a response to the mistreatment of subordinates by those in power. \n\nThe word \"mutiny\" comes from the Latin \"mutinare,\" which means \"to revolt.\" It was first used in English in the 16th century. Mutinies can occur in any hierarchical organization, including non-military ones, but they are most commonly associated with naval and military contexts.\n\nOne of the most famous mutinies in history is the Mutiny on the Bounty, which took place aboard the British Royal Navy ship HMS Bounty on 28 April 1789. The mutiny was led by Fletcher Christian against the ship's captain, William Bligh. The mutineers set Bligh and 18 loyalists adrift in a small boat, while they attempted to establish a new life on Pitcairn Island.\n\nAnother well-known mutiny is the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny. This was a widespread and bloody uprising against British rule in India, led by Indian soldiers, known as sepoys, who were employed by the British East India Company. The rebellion, which lasted more than a year, had profound effects on British policy in India and marked the beginning of the end of the East India Company's rule.\n\nMutinies can have significant consequences, both for the individuals involved and for the larger organization or society. They can lead to changes in leadership, policy, or even the structure of the organization. However, they can also result in punishment for the mutineers, including imprisonment or death.\n\nIn modern times, mutinies are relatively rare, particularly in professional militaries. This is due in part to changes in military culture and policy, including improved conditions for soldiers and sailors, better training and discipline, and more effective methods of dealing with dissatisfaction and dissent.\n\nHowever, the potential for mutiny remains a concern in any hierarchical organization, particularly in times of stress or crisis. Leaders must be aware of the risk and take steps to prevent it, such as by maintaining good relations with their subordinates, treating them fairly, and addressing their concerns promptly and effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, a mutiny is a serious act of rebellion that can have far-reaching consequences. It is a reflection of deep dissatisfaction and a desire for",
    "The Patidar reservation agitation was a social and political movement in the Indian state of Gujarat that began in July 2015. The agitation was led by the Patidar community, also known as the Patel community, who demanded inclusion in the Other Backward Class (OBC) category to qualify for reserved quotas in education and government jobs.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Patidar community, traditionally known as land-owning farmers, constitutes about 12-14% of Gujarat's population. Over the years, the community has diversified into various businesses and professions. However, a significant section of the community, especially the youth, began to feel marginalized due to limited opportunities in education and employment. They attributed this to the reservation system, which provides quotas for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC).\n\nThe Movement\n\nThe Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), led by Hardik Patel, emerged as the face of the agitation. The movement gained momentum with a series of rallies and protests across Gujarat. The largest rally, held in Ahmedabad on August 25, 2015, saw an estimated turnout of around 500,000 people.\n\nThe agitation turned violent after the arrest of Hardik Patel, leading to widespread riots and curfews in several parts of the state. The violence resulted in the death of at least eleven people and significant property damage.\n\nGovernment Response\n\nThe Gujarat government, initially dismissive of the agitation, was forced to take notice after the escalation of violence. Several rounds of negotiations were held between the government and PAAS, but they failed to reach a consensus.\n\nIn 2016, the government proposed a 10% quota for the economically backward among the upper castes, which included the Patidars. However, this was rejected by the PAAS, which insisted on OBC status for the Patidars.\n\nImpact and Aftermath\n\nThe Patidar reservation agitation had significant political implications. It was seen as a major challenge to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Gujarat, which had enjoyed the support of the Patidar community for several decades. The agitation also sparked similar demands from other communities in Gujarat and other states.\n\nThe agitation has been a subject of intense debate and discussion in India, raising questions about the relevance and effectiveness of the reservation system, the socio-economic disparities within so-called 'upper castes', and the political use of caste identities.\n\nAs of 2021, the demand for OBC status by the Patidar community",
    "Capparaceae, commonly known as the Caper family, is a family of plants in the order Brassicales. The family comprises about 33 genera and about 700 species of flowering plants that are known for their profuse growth habit, diverse morphology, and adaptation to different environments. The plants belonging to this family are native to many regions of the world, thrives in tropical and subtropical areas while some species can tolerate temperate climates.\n\nCapparaceae has a global distribution, but the greatest concentration of species is in the tropics and subtropics. The family is particularly diverse and prominent in the arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America, Africa, and Asia, including the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions. This family of plants plays a crucial role in the sustainability of these ecosystems.\n\nMembers of the Capparaceae family are typically shrubs, trees, or lianas and are noted for their beautiful, showy flowers, often produced in generous clusters. The flowers are usually white or pink and are large with a long staminal column. They contain many stamens, four sepals, and four petals. The fruit of these plants comes in a whole variety of forms, from berries to capsules, making them quite diverse.\n\nOne of the most well-known members of Capparaceae is the caper bush (Capparis spinosa), a perennial plant that bears edible, flower buds known as capers, a popular ingredient in Mediterranean cuisine. Capers are harvested before they bloom and are usually pickled or salted for use as a seasoning or garnish. Some other economically valuable species in this family include Cleome spinosa, the spider flower, used as an ornamental plant, and Crateva religiosa, the sacred garlic pear, which has multiple medicinal uses.\n\nThe family Capparaceae was established by French botanist Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 in his seminal book, \"Genera Plantarum.\"\n\nCapparaceae has been of interest to scientists and researchers because of its phylogenetic importance. It also plays a critical role in the study of coevolutionary patterns with insects, mainly because many Capparaceae plants serve as exclusive host plants for specific caterpillar species. \n\nThough Capparaceae may not be very familiar by name to many, the members of this family play a significant part in ecology, cooking, and horticulture.

    "Necmettin Erbakan (29 October 1926 – 27 February 2011) was a Turkish politician, engineer, and academic who served as the Prime Minister of Turkey from 1996 to 1997. He was the leader of several Islamic political parties and is noted for being the first Islamist to ever become Prime Minister of Turkey. His tenure was marked by attempts to increase the influence of Islam in Turkey, which were met with resistance from the secularist military and judiciary, leading to his removal from office.\n\nErbakan was born in Sinop, on the Black Sea coast of northern Turkey. He graduated from Istanbul Technical University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. He then pursued further studies in Germany, where he earned a PhD in the same field. Upon his return to Turkey, he became a professor at the Istanbul Technical University and later served as the rector of the Istanbul Technical University.\n\nErbakan entered politics in the 1960s, founding the National Order Party in 1970. The party was closed down by the constitutional court for violating the principle of secularism. He later established the National Salvation Party, which was also closed down for the same reason. Despite these setbacks, Erbakan continued his political career, founding the Welfare Party in 1983. The party won the 1995 general elections, and Erbakan became Prime Minister in 1996.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Erbakan sought to increase the role of Islam in Turkish society. He proposed closer ties with Muslim countries, attempted to lift the ban on wearing headscarves in public institutions, and introduced measures to increase Islamic education. These moves were met with resistance from the secularist military and judiciary, who saw them as a threat to Turkey's secular order.

His party was later banned, and he was barred from politics for five years.\n\nAfter the ban was lifted, Erbakan returned to politics, founding the Felicity Party in 2001. He continued to advocate for an increased role of Islam in Turkish society until his death in 2011.\n\nErbakan's legacy is a subject of debate in Turkey. Supporters view him as a champion of Islamic values and the underprivileged, while critics see him as a threat to Turkey's secular order.

    "Ladies' Gaelic football is a team sport played by women, originating from Ireland. It is a variant of Gaelic football, a sport traditionally played by men, and is governed by the Ladies' Gaelic Football Association. The sport is played with a round ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goals at each end. The primary objective of the game is to score by kicking or punching the ball into the other team's goals or between two upright posts above the goals and over a crossbar 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) above the ground.\n\nHistory\n\nLadies' Gaelic football was officially recognized in 1974 with the establishment of the Ladies' Gaelic Football Association (LGFA). However, the sport has been played informally by women for many years prior to this. The first All-Ireland Ladies' Gaelic football championship took place in 1974, with Tipperary winning the inaugural title. Since then, the sport has grown in popularity, with over 1000 clubs in Ireland and abroad, and an estimated 180,000 registered players.\n\nRules and Gameplay\n\nThe rules of Ladies' Gaelic football are almost identical to those of men's Gaelic football. Teams consist of 15 players, with the game lasting 60 minutes, divided into two halves of 30 minutes each. The ball used in Ladies' Gaelic football is slightly smaller than that used in the men's game. \n\nPlayers can carry the ball in their hands and are allowed to take four steps with the ball, after which they must either pass it or 'solo', an action of dropping the ball onto the foot and kicking it back into the hand. Physical contact is limited, with tackling allowed only when a player is in possession of the ball or when competing for it.\n\nScoring is achieved by kicking or punching the ball into the opponent's goal (3 points) or over the crossbar (1 point).
