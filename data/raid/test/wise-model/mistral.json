    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type. This\ndevelops work of Uhlenbeck, Segal, and Burstall-Guest to non-compact inner\nsymmetric spaces. To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity. This provides a straightforward way to construct all such harmonic\nmaps.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",
    "Deep neural networks have achieved satisfactory performance in piles of\nmedical image analysis tasks. However the training of deep neural network\nrequires a large amount of samples with high-quality annotations. In medical\nimage segmentation, it is very laborious and expensive to acquire precise\npixel-level annotations. Aiming at training deep segmentation models on\ndatasets with probably corrupted annotations, we propose a novel Meta Corrupted\nPixels Mining (MCPM) method based on a simple meta mask network. Our method is\ntargeted at automatically estimate a weighting map to evaluate the importance\nof every pixel in the learning of segmentation network. The meta mask network\nwhich regards the loss value map of the predicted segmentation results as\ninput, is capable of identifying out corrupted layers and allocating small\nweights to them. An alternative algorithm is adopted to train the segmentation\nnetwork and the meta mask network, simultaneously. Extensive experimental\nresults on LIDC-IDRI and LiTS datasets show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches which are devised for coping with corrupted\nannotations.",

    "  It is an important task to faithfully evaluate the perceptual quality of\noutput images in many applications such as image compression, image restoration\nand multimedia streaming. A good image quality assessment (IQA) model should\nnot only deliver high quality prediction accuracy but also be computationally\nefficient. The efficiency of IQA metrics is becoming particularly important due\nto the increasing proliferation of high-volume visual data in high-speed\nnetworks. We present a new effective and efficient IQA model, called gradient\nmagnitude similarity deviation (GMSD). The image gradients are sensitive to\nimage distortions, while different local structures in a distorted image suffer\ndifferent degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore the use of\nglobal variation of gradient based local quality map for overall image quality\nprediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity (GMS)\nbetween the reference and distorted images combined with a novel pooling\nstrategy the standard deviation of the GMS map can predict accurately\nperceptual image quality.

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic. Edges are constructed by\ndividing image into different catchment basins with the help of a membership\nfunction. Finally closed contour algorithm is applied to find closed regions\nand objects within closed regions are segmented using intensity information.\nThe performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated both objectively as well\nas subjectively.

For comparative analysis, various comparison\nmethods are used for demonstrating the superiority of proposed methods over\nexisting segmentation methods.",
    "  The effects of residual amplitude modulation (RAM) in laser interferometers\nusing heterodyne sensing can be substantial and difficult to mitigate. In this\nwork, we analyze the effects of RAM on a complex laser interferometer used for\ngravitational wave detection.

This shift causes variations in\nthe sensing matrix, and leads to degradation in the performance of the\nprecision noise subtraction scheme of the multiple-degree-of-freedom control\nsystem. In addition, such detuned optical cavities produce an opto-mechanical\nspring, which also varies the sensing matrix.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

To efficiently process video, we propose 3D separable\nconvolution for the pyramid pooling module and decoder, which dramatically\nreduces the number of operations while maintaining the performance. Moreover,\nwe also extend our framework to video action segmentation by adding an extra\nclassifier to predict the action label for actors in videos.

Our generative\nadversarial network based model works on a conditional probability approach.\nThis approach makes the image translation independent of any local, global and\ncontent or style features. In our approach we use a bidirectional\nreconstruction model appended with the affine transform factor that helps in\nconserving the content and photorealism as compared to other models. The\nadvantage of using such an approach is that the image-to-image translation is\nsemi-supervised, independant of image segmentation and inherits the properties\nof generative adversarial networks tending to produce realistic. This method\nhas proven to produce better results than Multimodal Unsupervised\nImage-to-image translation.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets. It also\noutperforms state-of-the-art edge detection methods on NYU depth dataset and\nachieves state-of-the-art on Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS 500).",
    "Current state-of-the-art methods for image segmentation form a dense image\nrepresentation where the color, shape and texture information are all processed\ntogether inside a deep CNN. This however may not be ideal as they contain very\ndifferent type of information relevant for recognition. Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes benchmark, in terms of both mask\n(mIoU) and boundary (F-score) quality, improving by 2% and 4% over strong\nbaselines.",
    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions. Our proof confirms recent numerical findings that already\nhinted at this convergence. Furthermore we offer a thorough mathematical\nunderpinning for networks of so-called theta neurons, where the OA ansatz has\njust been applied. In a final step we extend our proof by allowing for\ntime-dependent and multi-dimensional parameters as well as for network\ntopologies other than global coupling. This renders the OA ansatz an excellent\nstarting point for the analysis of a broad class of realistic settings.\n",
    "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the non-invasive modality of choice for\nbody tissue composition analysis due to its excellent soft tissue contrast and\nlack of ionizing radiation.

When she thinks her two children do not need her any longer, Lila Schwartz, a sexually active woman, leaves behind her family, calls herself Lila Munroe and moves to California, where she trains, and later works, as a lawyer. Faced with the dual challenge of having to raise two teenage kids while remaining successful in his demanding job as a publicist and speech writer, Bernard Schwartz more and more relies on medication to cope with everyday life. The real trouble begins when he accidentally swallows two incompatible antidepressants and falls into a coma shortly thereafter. While he is unconscious Bernard Schwartz has a stroke. When he wakes up again he is seriously handicapped&mdash;his speech is slurred, his walk is unsteady and his memory is permanently impaired. Similar to a child, he has to learn the meanings of many words. Instead of going to school, Chris teaches his father as best as he can. In spite of his enforced preoccupation with his \"sleeping\" father, Chris Schwartz notices that his own life goes on without any major change. Still a virgin, he fantasizes about having sex with Lisa Danmeyer, Bernard's neurologist and actually has his first sexual encounter ever at his father's rehab centre with a sexy speech pathologist who performs fellatio on him. At the same time Cathy, his 16 year-old sister, is on the brink of abandoning her Jewish roots and converting to Roman Catholicism. However, she also develops a crush on Francis Dial, her brother's best friend and classmate. Chris cannot believe that his younger sister might have sex before he does, but in the end this is exactly what happens, an unwanted teenage pregnancy being the result of their union. At first the young lovers are unsure whether Cathy should have an abortion or not, but Cathy soon makes up her mind to keep the baby.",
    " The school has been run since its inception ten years earlier by two elderly educators, Mabel Edge and Hermione Baker, who are regarded by many as old spinsters hopelessly out of touch with reality, especially with what their teenage charges really think and feel. The 300 or so students are virtually indistinguishable from one another, a fact which is stressed by their names all starting with the letter M: Margot, Marion, Mary, Melissa, Merode, Midget, Mirabel, Moira. Their budding but suppressed sexuality&mdash;they are all between 16 and 18 years of age and \"going to be attractive\"&mdash;is constantly alluded to in the novel. (\"They're only children, the girls I mean, and sex is unconscious at their age. It's such a temptation for a man.\") Of the teaching staff, only few characters are mentioned. There is Miss Winstanley, young, colourless, and secretly in love with one of the few male teachers at the academy, economics tutor Sebastian Birt. Birt, however, a short and stout man in his late twenties, is having an affair with Elizabeth Rock, a 35 year-old woman recovering from a nervous breakdown who temporarily also lives on the school grounds, in her grandfather's cottage. That man, 76 year-old Mr Rock, is a retired scientist who has been granted the privilege to live there for the remainder of his life for past services rendered to the State. The aging Rock, who is referred to as \"the sage\" by some (including the narrator) and as \"Gapa\" by his granddaughter, spends his time mainly with, and for, his pets&mdash;his albino sow, Daisy, his cat, Alice, and his goose, Ted. He describes himself as \"a bit stiff about the joints these days\", he has some difficulty climbing steps, has poor eyesight, is deaf in one ear and almost deaf in the other, and has recently had problems with his memory. In addition, one of his idiosyncrasies consists in putting all the post he gets in a big trunk without opening any of it, ever. Edge, one of the principals, has for some time wanted to thoroughly \"spring-clean\" the whole place and get rid of Rock, his granddaughter, and Birt, partly in order to secure the sage's cottage for the use of additional school staff. In other matters, she is more hesitant. When in the morning some girls report Mary and Merode missing, pointing out that neither of their beds has been slept in, Edge turns out to be very reluctant to use the official channels to inform relatives, the school supervisor, or the local police. Naturally it occurs to her and her colleague Baker that Mary and Merode might have eloped with two young men (\"At the station much of their time was taken up with young women adrift, who, after fourteen days, returned brown and happy from a fortnight with a boy by the ocean.\"), but, rather than fearing the worst, they assume the girls will be back for that night's entertainment, a ball in honour of the academy's founder&mdash;without men of course. At the same time Edge turns down some of the staff's requests to be allowed to go swimming in the nearby lake, which is interpreted as a sure sign that one of the girls' bodies could turn up any time floating in the water. In the course of the day, especially where Rock is involved, lots of people talk at cross-purposes, deliberately as well as accidentally misunderstanding what others are saying, in many instances only hinting at facts or, worse, spreading rumours. Around noon Merode is found, right on the compound but somewhat dazed, under a fallen beech in the vicinity of Rock's cottage&mdash;the very beech tree used by Sebastian Birt and Elizabeth Rock when they want to have some fun. According to school regulations, Merode must not be interrogated before she has submitted a written statement about what has happened, and she is immediately locked away for her own good. The rest of the afternoon is mainly taken up with preparations for the dance. As usual, the Founder's Day Ball is held without any guests from outside the school. However, Rock and his granddaughter turn up unexpectedly but appropriately dressed, without having been invited by anyone. While Mary is still missing (the reader never learns where she is or what has happened to her), Elizabeth Rock and Sebastian Birt start dancing together cheek to cheek and, generally, appear glued to each other, a \"display of animalism\" Edge is not willing to put up with any longer. Almost at the end of her tether, she secretly indulges in a cigarette or two in her office. Meanwhile Mr Rock is accosted by several of the girls who first want to dance with him and later drag him downstairs into the cellar of the building where they take turns kissing him and where they introduce him to the \"Institute Inn\", their secret club. Although Rock initially enjoys the girls' attentions, he quickly becomes appalled by their lack of morals and leaves the \"club.\" He comes upon his nemesis, Miss Edge, but after his experiences with the girls he is more sympathetic to her difficulties maintaining order at the school. For her part, Edge is impressed with the courtly bearing Rock has affected in the Ball's formal setting and also consumed by a tobacco-fueled lassitude. The two older adults have a pleasant conversation which comes to a head when Edge, almost without realizing, finds herself proposing marriage to Rock. The sage is astounded, and politely but firmly rejects her suggestion. He then leaves the ball and returns home to his animals. At the end of the day no one has reached any conclusions, and everything remains undecided.",

The principal claims that she did this to ensure they were wearing proper attire for the school dance. She also claims that her job is not only to ensure they get a proper education, but that they also grow into proper ladies and do not become sluts. She sends several girls home for wearing slutty panties. Although there is no crime to charge her with, Jesse determines to make trouble for her until he can find something to charge her with as he is convinced the girls’ civil rights were violated. He begins interviewing the principal along with her high powered attorney husband, as well as the girls. Later one of the girls comes to see Jesse at his office. She tells him that her parents are swingers, and often host parties for that purpose at their home. She and her little brother hate it and she asks Jesse if he can help. With swinging not illegal, Jesse finds his hands tied, but decides to investigate anyway. He has Suit talk to two of the women, one of whom he knew in high school, to get more information on the swingers club. Suit discovers that the girl’s mother is not into it, but only does it because her husband wants to. Jesse has Spike threaten her husband about the swinging, and she later leaves him. The main plot of the novel involves the investigation of the Night Hawk. The Night Hawk starts as a peeping tom, and the Paradise police get several calls about him. Later the Night Hawk escalates his voyeuristic attacks by breaking into homes while women are home alone, forcing them to undress at gunpoint, and then taking nude photos of them. He then begins writing Jesse detailing his exploits, and includes the nude photos. He writes that he cannot stop himself; he must discover these women’s “secret.” He also writes that he does not know what he will do next and fears that he will escalate further. Jesse begins to combine his investigation of the swingers with his investigation of the Night Hawk. Since the Night Hawk never touches anyone, he questions the swingers to find out if there is anyone in their club that only likes to watch and never touch. The women in the club all identify Seth Ralston. Ralston is a professor of English at a nearby university. He is married to a young grad student who is working on her doctorate. Jesse discovers that Ralston's wife used to teach a Wednesday night class, which corresponds with all the peeping tom reports. He also discovers that the peeping tom reports stopped at the same time that Ralston’s wife quit her teaching job to begin doing her doctoral work full time. Jesse questions Ralston’s wife about the swinging to see if she will inadvertently reveal something about her husband that will confirm he is the Night Hawk, and even hints to her that her husband may be the Night Hawk. She responds by belittling Jesse for being a dumb cop, and singling them out for their lifestyle. Meanwhile Jesse continues to pressure Betsy Ingersoll, who then reports that she is a victim of the Night Hawk. Soon after Jesse receives a nude photo of Betsy, however he and Molly become convinced that she is posing in the photo and suspect the attack was staged. The local media request an interview concerning the attack, and Jesse uncharacteristically agrees. He gives details of the attack and later receives a letter from the Night Hawk who demands that he never attacked Betsy Ingersoll. Jesse believes that the Night Hawk is telling the truth, as he has never denied an attack before, but always been honest about his attacks. Jesse confronts Betsy with this and she admits that she staged the attack. She says that she did it to get some attention from her husband, but that he did not even care. She was acting out because her husband cheats on her constantly with young women, which also explains her obsession with teenage girls not growing up to be sluts. Jesse agrees not to charge her with any crimes if she agrees to see Sunny Randall’s shrink, Dr. Silverman (the long-term love interest of another Parker character Spenser), which she does. A few days later Seth Ralston’s wife comes to Jesse to report that her husband is missing. They begin searching for him, and soon after Jesse receives another letter from the Night Hawk blasting him for speaking with his wife, and ruining his life. He writes that he is going to leave town, but only after he discovers one more woman’s secret, as he calls it, and warns that this woman will be someone close to Jesse. Jesse thinks that he is trying to hint that the woman will be Betsy Ingersoll, but Jesse believes he is actually targeting Molly. They set a police unit in front of Betsy’s house as a decoy, but then stake out Molly’s house. Molly waits at home with a gun strapped to her thigh, and a wire so Jesse can hear her. The Night Hawk breaks in on her and forces her to begin stripping at gun point. Suit and Jesse then break in to arrest him. Surprised that they figured out he was after Molly, he raises his gun to shoot her, but Molly, Suit, and Jesse all shoot and kill Seth Ralston, putting an end to the Night Hawk. Suit is left with a moral dilemma that it was his shot that killed Ralston, but since all three fired, Jesse is able to disfuse the situation by convincing Suit that it could have been any one of the three.",
    " The story outlines contact between Earth and the title Visitors, a group of mysterious objects from deep space. The Visitors are simple black oblong boxes, as large as buildings, which approach from space and orbit the Earth before descending to the United States. The nature of the visitors is kept rather mysterious&nbsp;— it's not clear if they are vehicles or living things in their own right. They are apparently unable to communicate with humans in any meaningful way; on one occasion a human is taken inside a Visitor, only to be released after experiencing a jumble of confusing colored lights and smells which he didn't understand. The Visitors are composed largely of a dense form of cellulose, and they proceed to consume a quantity of trees and plant life in the US. Eventually they start producing vehicles, superficially resembling human cars but capable of flying using the same unknown principles as the Visitors themselves, and apparently incorporating some element of intelligence, or at least instinct, since they do not crash into things as they move. The humans assume that the Visitors have created these vehicles as a gift in return for the plant matter which the Visitors are consuming, and the novel touches on the disruption such well-meaning gifts might incur on the Earth's economic systems. Toward the end of the book the Visitors also start producing housing units for humans, and it is even implied that something living may be inside them&nbsp;— perhaps even a Visitor-produced version of humans themselves.",
    " The Republic is decaying, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was elected to save the galaxy from collapsing under the forces of discontent. On the tiny but strategic planet of Ansion, a powerful faction is on the verge of joining the growing Separatist movement. The urban dwellers wish to expand into the prairies outside their cities - the ancestral territory of the fierce, independent Ansion nomads. If their demands are not met, they will secede - an act that could jump-start a chain reaction of withdrawal and rebellion by other worlds of the Republic. At the Chancellor's request, the Jedi Council sends Kenobi and fellow Jedi Luminara Unduli to resolve the conflict and negotiate with the elusive nomads. Undaunted, Kenobi and Unduli, along with their Padawans Skywalker and Barriss Offee, set out across the wilderness. Many perils lie waiting to trap them. The Jedi will have to fulfill near-impossible tasks, befriend wary strangers, and influence two great armies to complete their quest, stalked all the while by an enemy sworn to see the negotiations collapse and the mission fail.",
    " The Land of Little Rain is a collection of short stories and essays detailing the landscape and inhabitants of the American Southwest. A message of environmental conservation and a philosophy of cultural and sociopolitical regionalism loosely links the stories together. ;\"The Land of Little Rain\" The opening essay describes the \"Country of Lost Borders,\" an area of land between Death Valley and the High Sierras. The image created of the land at the beginning of the story is one of almost unbearable heat and dryness, punctuated by violent storms. Despite the description of how inhospitable the landscape is, at the end Austin proposes that the costs the land imposes upon a man are worth it because it provides man with peace of mind and body that cannot be achieved any other way. ;\"Water Trails of the Ceriso\" The section's title refers to the trails made by wild animals moving towards sources of water. The essay provides descriptions of the many animals that travel along the trails, including coyotes, rabbits, and quails. Their ability to find water where there seems to be none is extolled by Austin, a skill which she believes no human is able to match. ;\"The Scavengers\" This essay describes the various animals that live in the desert that feed upon carrion&mdash;most notably, the buzzards and the carrion crows. This scavenging is portrayed as a natural part of the desert, with a multitude of the scavengers working together to find food. The end of the story criticizes the actions of man with regard to the desert. The unnatural trash he leaves cannot used by the scavengers in the story, and as such serves as a stark contrast to the desert's natural processes for recycling waste. ;\"The Pocket Hunter\" A pocket hunter is a type of miner who hunts for pockets of ore deposits. In the story, the pocket hunter described by Mary Austin lives off of the land with minimal interactions with the civilized world. This harmony with nature, Austin argues, is essential to the pocket hunter's simple happiness. Despite Austin's muted praise, the pocket hunter wants to strike it rich in order to move to Europe and mingle with the landed elite, a goal he accomplishes. However, by the end of the story, the pocket hunter returns to the desert since it is his \"destiny\". ;\"Shoshone Land\" \"Shoshone Land\" narrates the experiences of Winnenap', an American Indian medicine man originally from Shoshone Land who was captured by the Paiute tribe. The story initially revolves around Winnenap', but quickly changes to a detailed description of the environment and wildlife of Shoshone Land to form an intimate tie between Winnenap' and the land he formerly inhabited. ;\"Jimville&mdash;a Bret Harte Town\" In the beginning of the section, Jimville is touted as a better source of inspiration for Bret Harte than he found during his own travels. Jimville's inhabitants are likened to the fictional characters that were present in some of Harte's short stories. Austin portrays Jimville as a small town set in a harsh environment and inhabited by simple yet endearing toughs. Although the inhabitants endure many hardships, Austin claims that there is an almost unexplainable pull which keeps them in town and encourages new travelers to stay. ;\"My Neighbor's Field\" The story is about a plot of land which changes hands many times&mdash;Austin characterizes this plot of land as an ideal field. She criticizes the owners of the field, the Indians and shepherds, because their habits and lifestyle scar the land. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that the field is destined to develop into an urban area. Austin claims that while the field may at that point serve a greater human use, it will not be better for the land and all life. ;\"The Mesa Trail\" This section describes one of the trails that runs through the American Southwest. It contains several passages detailing the damage human activity has done to the land. She criticizes the \"unsightly scars\" left by the Paiute Indians in the form of abandoned campoodies and the damaged plant life left by domesticated animals such as sheep. ;\"The Basket Maker\" This story follows the life of Seyavi, a Paiute Indian who loses her mate, lives alone with her child, and sells baskets she weaves in order to survive. Austin claims that the Paiutes make the land itself their home, with the natural ridges of mountains as walls and the wild almond bloom as their furnishings. It is because of this that Austin argues that the Paiutes will always be homesick when in homes built by man, as man cannot replicate nature's walls and furnishings. ;\"The Streets of the Mountains\" This essay consists of long description of mountains and their respective trails. The section characterizes the beauty of the mountains and their inhabitants. The story also contains critiques people who dwell in man-made houses. The comfort provided by such houses, Austin argues, results in people not being able to truly understand the beauty and divinity of the mountains. ;\"Water Borders\" The essay revolves around the streams and lakes that can be found in the mountains, generally formed from the melting snow higher in the mountains. The particular mountain in the story is Oppapago, a mountain within the Sierras in a forest reserve. Austin contrasts the mountain landscape to a meadow outside a forest reserve, which lacks color and beauty because it is damaged by the grazing of sheep. ;\"Other Water Borders\" \"Other Water Borders\" is centered more on the plants affected by the water from the mountains, both wild and cultivated. The story begins with a depiction of a squabble between several locals over an irrigation ditch filled by water from the mountains. This is followed by a series of descriptions of the variety of plants that the irrigation ditch allows to thrive. Found within these depictions of plant life is Austin's lament of the complexities of civilization. Austin implies that with the advent of cities and manufactured objects people have lost an innate ability to know what natural remedies may be beneficial or detrimental to one's health. ;\"Nurslings of the Sky\" The \"nurslings of the sky\" are storms, formed in the hills and given almost human characteristics by Austin. The beginning of the story contains an account of the destruction of a town by floods and snow. The blame for the events is not placed on nature, but rather the people whose poorly placed town was destroyed. The story continues with descriptions of storms and their effects upon the wildlife of the area, pausing to explain how the land teaches people things. The story uses the example of a group of Native Americans who learn the use of smoke signals by observing the dust pillars formed by desert winds at the edges of mesas. The end of the story expresses Austin's discontent at how people have dealt with the weather by determining the best seasons to plant crops rather than by musing about the \"eternal meanings of the skies\". ;\"The Little Town of the Grape Vines\" \"The Little Town of Grape Vines,\" or El Pueblo de Las Uvas, tells a story of a simple people living in peace with their environment. With houses made of mud, homemade wine, and gardens to provide the fruits, vegetables, and herbs, the townspeople live a simple life without the complex notions of wealth and class that Austin feels have corrupted much of society. Austin describes the lives of the people living in the town, lives which consist of little more than planting, harvesting, eating, making music, raising children, and dancing. The end of the story is a call back to the simple life exemplified in \"The Little Town of the Grape Vines,\" criticizing those people who are overly obsessed with their own perceived importance in a world where their actions truly matter little.",
    " The book shares the personal stories of several families fighting autism. These stories focus on alternative autism therapies that they try to heal their children, as well as McCarthy's own reminiscing about her autistic child and her outspoken and contentious activism. The book includes the daughter of the founder of Autism Speaks, who claims to have changed her son's diet and improved his autism despite conspiratorial resistance from the organization, which, the book claims, until recently, rejected research into biomedical treatments; a mother who is claimed \"healed\" her son of his autism while taking on breast cancer; a father whose son was officially undiagnosed after allegedly under-going treatment for a laundry list of debilitating autism symptoms and regressions; and a sixty-year-old woman who made attempts to fight to save her son (now thirty) in the 1980s, the book exclaims that she paved the way for the parents of today. The book also features a list of controversial autism resources and a directory of DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!) doctors who are sympathetic to the widely discredited theory that autism is caused by mercury in vaccines.",
    " Azriel is telling the story of his transformation into and subsequent existence as an immortal genii who is forced to obey the Master who calls him. Over centuries, Azriel becomes less obedient to the Masters and a warning is placed on the casket of his bones that he is not to be summoned lest his evil be loosed upon the undeserving world. After many centuries of rest, Azriel finds himself awake and in New York City, a dazed witness to the murder of a young woman, Esther Belkin. He becomes inexplicably obsessed with the desire to avenge her death and to find out who called him into the physical world in time to see Esther die but not in time to save her. This quest leads him to the girl's stepfather, Gregory Belkin, who would pay any price to fulfill his messianic dream via his immense worldwide religious organization, the Temple of the Mind of God. As his quest approaches its climax, he risks his supernatural powers to forestall an attempt to destroy the world thus redeeming what was denied him for so long: his own eternal human soul.",
    " The story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947. Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old. Thursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \"Outland\" to find out what people in the real world think of him. Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenburg cake, has some curious house guests: Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos. Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them. Despite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues. She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the aging English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \"The Windowmaker\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike. Thursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him. On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\"). Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday. Goliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO -- at their headquarters in the Isle of Man -- and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness. Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband. Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilize. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \"stick\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly. On top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final in order to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy). She succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.",
    " Up to this time Cornwell had been going back through the period of the Napoleonic Wars to find new incidents into which to place his hero. Rather than do this, he adopts a \"prequel\" approach and uses an earlier campaign period in the history of the British Army, that of colonial India. The novel opens with Richard Sharpe serving as a private with the British army, then invading Mysore and advancing on the Tippoo Sultan's capital city of Seringapatam. Sharpe is contemplating desertion with his paramour, widow Mary Bickerstaff. His sadistic company sergeant, Obadiah Hakeswill, deliberately provokes Sharpe into attacking him, and engineers the virtual death sentence of 2,000 lashes for the private. But Sharpe is rescued by Lieutenant William Lawford after 200 lashes are inflicted, in order to effect a rescue mission behind the Tippoo's lines. Lawford and Sharpe are ordered to pose as deserters to rescue Colonel Hector McCandless, chief of the British East India Company's intelligence service. Although Lawford is nominally in command, Sharpe quickly dominates the lieutenant by force of personality and, without authorization, brings Mary on the mission. Joining the Tippoo's army, they discover that the Tippoo has set a trap for the invading British by mining the weakest (and thus most inviting) portion of Seringapatam's walls. Before Sharpe and Lawford can discover a way to transmit a warning to the British, they are betrayed by Sergeant Hakeswill. Hakeswill has been captured in battle and the Tippoo orders him made a human sacrifice for victory, but Hakeswill secures the Sultan's mercy in exchange for revealing Sharpe's and Lawford's identity as spies. Sharpe and Lawford are imprisoned as the British army prepares to assault the booby-trapped wall of the city. Mary helps Sharpe to escape, and Sharpe blows up the mine before the main British army can enter the trap. As the Tippoo tries to flee the city, Sharpe finds him in a dark tunnel, kills him, and steals his rich jewels. Sharpe throws Hakeswill to the Tippoo's tigers, but the recently fed animals ignore Hakeswill, and Sharpe's enemy survives to plague him in later adventures.",

    " On Abarrach, Xar is attempting to learn the secret of necromancy, but he needs a corpse to test it on. He interrogates the lazar Kleitus about the location of any living Sartan, and Kleitus reveals that Haplo lied to Xar about all the Sartan dying at the hands of the dead; Balthazar and his group remain living. Kleitus drops a hint about the Seventh Gate, and reveals that it's where the Sundering took place and that Haplo's corpse would know its location. Xar dismisses this idea, as well as the lazar, and is quickly becoming obsessed with the Seventh Gate when receives word that two Sartan have been captured: Zifnab, for one, whose pleas on Haplo's behalf go unheeded; and, as quite a prize, Samah, ruler of the Council of Seven. Xar is initially excited since Samah is the very person who would know the Seventh Gate's location, and he interrogates Samah for it to no avail. Sang-drax&mdash; the one who actually captured Samah and Zifnab&mdash; is summoned by Xar to mentally torture Samah to death; even before he dies, Samah does not reveal anything useful. Xar succeeds in turning him into a far-more-complacent lazar, but too much of Samah's will remains, and he still won't talk. Even worse, when Xar turns his back to investigate Zifnab's disappearance, Jonathan walks in and teaches Samah how to let go; the leader of the Council of Seven is now well and truly dead. Xar is soon told by Sang-drax of Haplo's \"treachery\"; he has helped the mensch start the Kicksey-winsey and given control of Arianus over to the mensch, instead of reserving it for Xar himself. Party to this conversation is the loyal servant who informed Xar of the capture and has already been ordered to investigate the Arianus situation: Marit, the woman Haplo loved, the mother of his child. Xar marries her in traditional Patryn fashion of rune-joining, both to ensure her loyalty and because it gives them an unblockable way to communicate, and then orders her to kill Haplo. Haplo rests on Arianus and tries to heal his heart-rune, a job that truly needs two people (most rune-healing is accomplished by \"circling\" and allowing strength from one person to flow to the other.) Prince Rees'ahn and King Stephen's deputy, the wizard Trian, have come to Drevlin to talk with High Froman Limbeck Bolttightener in the hopes of hammering out some sort of true alliance between all three races of mensch (the mysteriarchs having folded into the human race after their leader Sinistrad's death.) Haplo gives the Kenkari book to Limbeck, and the three races together reactivate the Kicksey-winsey, which realigns the scattered islands of Arianus and starts a constant flow of water through the sky. Then Haplo enters his dragonship and prepares to leave for the last time. Hugh, under contract to kill Haplo, retraces his own steps. He goes from the Cathedral of the Albedo back to the Fortress of the Brotherhood, where Ciang gives him a cursed knife: ugly, badly made, capable of self-movement... and covered in Sartan runes. It is the only weapon the Brotherhood has that might even possibly be capable of killing Haplo. As payment for it, Ciang orders him to never return or further payment will be taken in his blood. Hugh, in the end, doesn't even use his new Cursed Blade&mdash; its main advantage, suppressing Haplo's warning runes and a good amount of his magic, allows Hugh to sneak up on him in his ship and capture him, but the tables turn and Hugh accidentally ends up with Haplo's knife in his gut... only to lurch back from the grave, Alfred's necromancy rune having evidently condemned him to eternal life. Haplo circles with Hugh to calm the human's distress at returning from the dead yet again, and the two begin to plan how to find Alfred when they are interrupted. Marit appears and fights both Haplo and Hugh. The first time they engage their Patryn rune-magic, however, the Cursed Blade reacts, transmuting itself into various threats, and the three break off their conflict periodically to quiet it down (they can't really make it stop;) they also struggle over the ship's steering-stone. Eventually Haplo takes the ship to Chelestra, hoping to douse the Cursed Blade in seawater, but the knife, instead of transforming into another weapon or creature, summons a dragon-snake that destroys the ship. As Haplo drifts in the sea, he hears a voice and looks up to see... Alfred. At Sang-drax's misleading suggestion, Xar has gone to Pryan with the pretext of taming the tytans, and he is frustrated with his inability to reach Marit. His real reason for being there is his hope of finding the Seventh Gate in the citadel that Haplo visited, but he finds little to encourage him. The five mensch&mdash; Paithan, Rega, Aleatha, Roland, and Drugar&mdash; aren't much help, nor is Zifnab, who has somehow gotten here after escaping from Abarrach. Shortly after Xar and Zifnab have arrived, Sang-drax says he knows now that Zifnab is \"one of them;\" after a battle with Zifnab's dragon, he takes on Xar's form and steals the ship, claiming that he will search for Haplo while Xar is on Pryan. It is revealed during Xar's stay that Zifnab is actually one of the dissenting Sartan who refused to go along with Samah's plan; he was among the mensch on Earth during the Sundering, and was the first of either race to escape the Labyrinth. It was he who penned many of the books Xar educated himself with. (With all that Zifnab has seen, his total dementia seems a bit more understandable.) Xar decides to leave Pryan in a ship he spotted outside the citadel, covered in Sartan runes, but to do that he needs to get past the tytans. He decides to need to kill off the mensch and revive them with necromancy to serve as distractions. The mensch are having their own problems. Paithan is obsessed with a room in the center of the citadel that he calls the Star Chamber, a room with seven huge seats and an apparatus that generates blinding light. Roland and Aleatha are mostly not on speaking terms; the elf maiden finds herself spending more time with Drugar, who may be the last of his race. But Drugar has discovered a delightful illusion: at a certain clearing in the garden maze, at certain times of the day, he can see ghostly shadows of people from all the mensch races, walking around and talking to each other. Aleatha is there when he uses his amulet to activate the platform, teleporting him instantly to a different citadel&mdash; where, as it turns out, there are other survivors. Marit finds herself in a Sartan prison. On a bench in the middle of the room, Haplo recovers from injuries caused by the Cursed Blade. Across from it, Hugh the Hand and the dog watch her with unblinking eyes. Their \"jailer\": none other than Alfred, who rescued them from Chelestra. After some discussion, Haplo realizes that they are in the Vortex, the one-way gate at the very center of the Labyrinth. It was here that the Patryns were initially imprisoned and chose to live for generations, until people calling themselves Nexus runners started trying to escape. (It's unknown when they abandoned the Vortex and all moved out into the Labyrinth.) Haplo decides to enter the Labyrinth in search of his daughter, whom Marit named Rue. Hugh agrees to go with him, as does Marit at Xar's command; he has told Marit to hold off on killing Haplo to report back any conversations Alfred and Haplo have about the other worlds. It is only Alfred who balks. He has nothing left&mdash; Orla \"saw\" Samah's death and chose a peaceful death to be with him&mdash; but fear of the unknown. The Labyrinth itself, however, refuses to let him return to the Vortex by unceremoniously dropping a mountain on top of the exit back into it. To Haplo, the Labyrinth seems afraid of Alfred, though he can't for the life of him figure out why; what is Alfred, besides a bumbling, useless Sartan? ...who can turn into a dragon and bring people back from the dead? The group is about to be overrun by tiger-men when, surprisingly, a Patryn raiding party comes to save them. This party comes from Abri, the one and only city inside the Labyrinth (anathema to the lone-wolf Patryns). While camping overnight, Alfred admits his true name to Haplo: Coren, a Sartan word that can mean \"to choose\" or perhaps \"chosen.\" Many Sartan children were named that, in hopes of a self-fulfilling prophecy, but (as Haplo points out) Alfred did not feel particularly amused when he awoke, the last living Sartan on Arianus. Clearly Alfred was Coren, was chosen&mdash;but for what? Marit, however, betrays them by revealing that Alfred is a Sartan. Haplo, Hugh, and Alfred are jailed by the city's leader, Headman Vasu, to await Lord Xar&mdash; Marit accused Haplo of being a traitor and plotting against their people&mdash; but are freed again just as quickly after Marit overhears the disguised Sang-drax plotting to kill them. Sang-drax and his cronies are also gathering a huge army of the Labyrinth's native monsters, with which to destroy the city of Abri and seal the Final Gate; they allowed Marit to overhear them to feed off the emotions that would come from it. Abri's occupants prepare for its defense, while Haplo and Marit, prodded by the dog, finally find their love for each other. Alfred feels out of place; though few seem to begrudge him his Sartan heritage, he is still out-of-place here, a clumsy pacifist in a city preparing for war. Talking with Headman Vasu, however, he eventually discovers that the city was not made by Patryns (who do not build cities,) or at least not by Patryns alone&mdash; the Sartan \"heretics\" who were expelled into the Labyrinth were accepted by the Patryns, eventually integrating completely into the society; Vasu himself is half-and-half, supplementing his Patryn tattoos with Sartan magic. The Patryns taught them the value of family; the Sartan, in return, taught the Patryns the value of banding together. Here, at the heart of the Labyrinth, rises Abri, the city that symbolizes the best in both cultures. Alfred also finds out why he is called the Serpent Mage: it is a title from a Sartan hierarchy of strength in magic, whose levels are named after animals. Serpent is very near the top. Alfred has found the meaning of his name: to choose his power, and all the responsibility it comes with... or to choose Alfred, who would rather faint than have to use his magic. Back on Pryan, Drugar returns from the other citadel with knowledge: he knows how to stop the tytans. Aleatha has fled the maze, though; pushed into hysterics by his sudden (and literal) disappearance, she ran back to her brother, and the four are now at a \"party\" of Xar's, at which he hopes to kill them with poisoned wine so that their bodies will be undamaged. Zifnab, however, saves them by drinking all of it himself and saying that it was poisoned, faking his death once again. The mensch are horrified at the revelation that Xar means to kill them. Aleatha escapes the room, while the other three are sealed inside by Xar... until Zifnab's dragon discovers Zifnab's \"death\" and tears the room apart. Aleatha has fled once again into the maze, where Xar can't pursue her because of protective Sartan runes covering its path. She runs into Drugar and he tells her they have to let the tytans inside to help them; he shares with her how to stop them. They run for the gates, but before they can reach it, Xar attacks; Drugar sacrifices himself to save Aleatha. Xar is about to kill Aleatha when the dragon strikes, distracting Xar with battling it instead of killing mensch. The other mensch have escaped from the destroyed room and find her, and they think she's mad when she tells them what she's going to do. She uses the amulet to open the gate and invites the tytans inside; they peacefully enter and ask, &mdash;Where is the citadel? to which Aleatha answers, \"Here is the Citadel. You are home.\" Xar recovers from his battle with the dragon, and prepares to leave for the Labyrinth after Marit reports back to him&mdash; apparently corrupted by Haplo's influence into thinking Xar has made a mistake in allying with the dragon-snakes, as she says they are planning an attack. He is surprised when the tytans don't kill the mensch, and actually act to protect the mensch from him, but he avoids a fight by snatching Drugar's amulet from Aleatha and running away with it. The amulet will gain him entry into the Sartan ship, which he can then use to return to the Labyrinth. At Abri, the battle between Patryns and Labyrinth creatures rages fiercely, but the real threat comes from the dragon-snakes. Haplo, Marit, and Hugh lead a sortie to deal with them, and the three battle Sang-drax in his serpent form. Sang-drax is apparently killed by Haplo, but Haplo has been badly injured and almost crushed beneath the massive body. Marit is attacked by a wolfen when a green and golden dragon carries it away: Alfred, having made his choice to accept his power. He lifts the serpent's body off of Haplo, leaving Marit to hold his blood-soaked form, his heart-rune's wound having reopened. But while Alfred is distracted in battle with the dragon-snakes, Xar appears. He wants Haplo's knowledge of the Chamber of the Damned, and will stop at nothing to get it. The battle ends with the Labyrinth's armies driven off, but Marit dazed and wounded, Haplo abducted by Xar, and Alfred missing in action.",
    " The Eight features two intertwined storylines set centuries apart. The first takes place in 1972 and follows American computer expert Catherine “Cat” Velis as she is sent to Algeria for a special assignment. The second is set in 1790 and revolves around Mireille, a novice nun at Montglane Abbey. The fates of both characters are intertwined as they try to unravel the mystery behind the Montglane Service, a chess set that holds the key to a game of unlimited power. A gift from the Moors to Emperor Charlemagne, these pieces have been hunted fervently throughout the years by those seeking ultimate control. In the throes of the French Revolution, Mireille and her cousin Valentine must help in dispersing the pieces of the chess set to keep them out of the wrong hands. However, when Valentine is brutally murdered in Reign of Terror, Mireille is thrown into the midst of men and women who would pursue power at any cost, including Napoleon, Robespierre, Talleyrand, Catherine the Great, and more. She comes to realize she must rely on her own intuition and tenacity to accomplish her goal. In 1972, Cat Velis faces a similar atmosphere of conspiracy, assassination and betrayal. When she is requested by an antique dealer to recover the chess pieces, she unwittingly enters into a mysterious game that will endanger her life. As she learns the story of the Montglane Service, she begins to realize that players of the Game may plan their moves, but their very existence makes them pawns as well.",

    " In his \"Preliminary Discourse\", Barruel defines the three forms of conspiracy as the \"conspiracy of impiety\" against God and Christianity, the \"conspiracy of rebellion\" against kings and monarchs, and \"the conspiracy of anarchy\" against society in general. He sees the end of the 18th century as \"one continuous chain of cunning, art, and seduction\" intended to bring about the \"overthrow of the altar, the ruin of the throne, and the dissolution of all civil society\". The first volume examines the anti-Christian conspiracy that was begun by Voltaire in 1728 when Barruel claimed that Voltaire \"consecrated his life to the annihilation of Christianity\". Barruel returned to the principal texts of the Enlightenment and found reasons to draw close links between the philosophism of the time and the anti-Christian campaigns of the Revolution. Here he found that the philosophes had created an age of pretend philosophy which they used in their battle with Christianity. Their commitment to liberty and equality were really commitments of \"pride and revolt\". Barruel claimed that the proponents of the Enlightenment led people into illusion and error and refers to the philosophes as \"Writers of this species, so far from enlightening the people, only contribute to lead them into the path of error\". He alleged that Voltaire, dAlembert, and Frederick II, the King of Prussia, planned the course of events that lead to the French Revolution. They began with an attack on the Church where a \"subterranean warfare of illusion, error, and darkness waged by the Sect\" attempted to destroy Christianity. The influence of the philosophes could not be underrated according to Barruel. They created the intellectual framework that put the conspiracy in motion and controlled the ideology of the secret societies. Barruel appears to have read the work of the philosophes and his direct and extensive quotes shows a deep knowledge of their beliefs. This is unusual among the enemies of the Enlightenment, who rarely distracted themselves by reading the works and authors they were attacking. Barruel believed the philosophes were important as the original villains that seduced the population and made Enlightenment, and subsequently revolutionary, ideals favorable. The second volume focuses on the anti-monarchical conspiracy that was led by Jean Jacques Rousseau and Baron de Montesquieu. These conspirators sought to destroy the established monarchies under the guise of \"Independence and Liberty\". Barruel analyses and criticizes Montesquieus The Spirit of Laws and Rousseaus Social Contract because the application of the ideas expressed in these books had \"given birth to that disquieted spirit which fought to investigate the rights of sovereignty, the extent of their authority, the pretended rights of the free man, and without which every subject is branded for a slave - and every king a despot\". He believed that the influence of these two writers was a necessary factor in the enactment of the French Revolution. He agreed with the revolutionaries as they themselves placed the remains of Voltaire and Rousseau in the Pantheon to pay homage to the \"fathers of the revolution\". Barruel believed that the philosophes had created a lasting influence as their spirit survived through their writings and continued to promote anti-monarchical feelings within the Jacobins and the revolutionaries. The destruction of monarchies in Europe led to the triumph of the Jacobins as they trampled \"underfoot the altars and the thrones in the name of that equality and that liberty which summon the peoples to the disasters of revolution and the horrors of anarchy\". Barruel equated the rejection on monarchy with a rejection of any type of order and government. As a result, the principles of equality and liberty and their attacks against the monarchy were attacks against all governments and civil society. He presented a choice to his readers between monarchy and the \"reign of anarchy and absolute independence\". Barruels third volume addresses the antisocial conspiracy that was the objective of the Freemasons and the Order of the Illuminati. The philosophes and their attacks against the church and the throne paved the way for the conspiracy that was led by these secret societies. These groups were believed to have constituted a single sect that numbered over 300,000 members who were \"all zealous for the Revolution, and all ready to rise at the first signal and to impart the shock to all others classes of the people\". Barruel surveyed the history of Masonry and maintained that its higher mysteries had always been of an atheist and republican cast. He believed the Freemasons kept their words and aims secret for many years but on August 12, 1792, two days after the fall of the French monarchy, they ran though the streets openly announcing their secrets. The secret words were \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity\" and the secret aim was the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the republic. Barruel claimed he heard them speak these words in France but that in other countries the Masons still kept their secrets. A division of the group into numerous lodges ensured that if the secrets of one lodge were discovered, the rest would remain hidden. He believed that it was his job to warn all governments and people of the goals of the Freemasons. Barruel described in detail how this system worked in the case of the Illuminati. Even after Johann Adam Weishaupt, the leader of the sect, was discovered and tried in court, the proceedings could not uncover the universal influence of the Illuminati and no steps were taken against the group. The majority of the secret societies could always survive and carry on their activities because of the organization of the group. The Illuminati, as a whole, functioned to radicalize the movement against the throne and altar and influenced more members of the population to subscribe to their hidden principles. They refined the secret structure that had been provided by the Masons basic framework. For Barruel, the final designs of the coalition of the philosophes, the Freemasons and the Illuminati were achieved by the Jacobins. These clubs were formed by \"the adepts of impiety, the adepts of rebellion, and the adepts of anarchy\" working together to implement their radical agenda. Their guiding philosophy and actions were the culmination of the conspiracy as they directly wanted to end the monarchy and the church. Barruel believed that the only difference between the Jacobins and their precursors was that the Jacobins actually brought down the church and the throne and were able to institute their basic beliefs and goals while their precursors only desired to do these things without much success. According to Barruel, the first major assault on the Enlightenment came during the French Revolution. In the minds of many, the Enlightenment was inextricably connected to the Revolution that followed. This presumed link resulted in an explosion of literature that was hostile to the Enlightenment. When the leaders of the Revolution canonized Voltaire and Rousseau and made the Enlightenment themes of reason, progress, anti-clericalism and emancipation central to their own revolutionary vocabulary, it created a link that meant any backlash against the Revolution would increase opposition to the Enlightenment. The advent of what Graeme Garrard has called the \"continuity thesis\" between the Enlightenment and the Revolution – the belief that they were connected in some intrinsic way, as cause and effect- proved damaging to the Enlightenment. For Barruel, the Revolution was not a spontaneous popular uprising expressing a long-suppressed general will. It was instead the consequence of a united minority group who used force, subterfuge and terror to impose their will on an innocent and unsuspecting population. Barruel believed that the Revolution was caused by Voltaire, Rousseau and the other philosophes who conspired with secret societies to destroy Catholicism and the monarchy in France. He argued that the writings of the philosophes had a great influence on those who would lead the Revolution and that Voltaire and his followers were responsible for the training of revolutionaries. It was from the followers of the philosophes \"that the revolutionary ministers Necker and Turgot started up; from this class arose those grand revolutionary agents, the Mirabeaux, Sieyes, Laclos, Condorcets; these revolutionary trumps, the Brissots, Champforts, Garats, Cheniers; those revolutionary butchers, the Carras, Frerons, Marats\". Within the Memoirs, Barruel alleged that Diderots Encyclopédie was a Masonic project. He believed that the written works of the philosophes penetrated all aspects of society and that this massive collection was of particular significance. The Encyclopédie was only the first step in philosophizing mankind and was necessary to spread the impious and anti-monarchical writings. This created a mass movement against the church and society. Barruel believed that the conspirators attempt to \"imbue the minds of the people with the spirit of insurrection and revolt\" and to promote radicalism within all members of society. This was believed to be the main reason behind the Encyclopédie as it was \"a vast emporium of all the sophisms, errors, or calumnies which had ever been invented against religion\". It contained \"the most profligate and impious productions of Voltaire, Diderot, Boulanger, La Mettrie, and of other Deists or Atheists of the age, and this under the specious pretence of enlightening ignorance\". Barruel believed the volumes of the Encyclopédie were valuable in controlling the minds of intellectuals and in creating a public opinion against Christianity and monarchy. Philosophism was a term used by Barruel within the Memoirs to refer to the pretend philosophy that the philosophes practiced. It was originally coined by Catholic opponents of the philosophes but was popularized by Barruel. It referred to the principles that were shared by philosophes, Freemasons, and Illuminati. Barruel defined philosophism as \"the error of every man who, judging of all things by the standard of his own reason, rejects in religious matters every authority that is not derived from the light of nature. It is the error of every man who denies the possibility of any mystery beyond the limits of reason if everyone who, discarding revelation in defence of the pretended rights of reason, Equality, and Liberty, seeks to subvert the whole fabric of the Christian religion\". The term had a lasting influence as by the end of the 18th century it had become a popular term of abuse used by conservative journals to refer to supporters of the Revolution. These journals accused those who practiced philosophism as having no principles or respect for authority. They were skeptics who failed to believe in the monarchy and the church and thus, had no principles. The use of the term became pervasive in the Anti-Jacobin Review and contributed to the belief in a connection between the Enlightenment and the Revolution and its supporters. Philosophism became a powerful tool of anti-revolutionary and anti-Jacobin rhetoric. Barruel identified a number of individuals who he believed played direct roles in the Enlightenment and the conspiracy against Christianity and the state. He identified Voltaire as the \"chief\", d’Alembert as the \"most subtle agent\", Frederick II as the \"protector and adviser\", and Diderot as its \"forlorn hope\". Voltaire was at the head of the conspiracy because he spent his time with the highest levels of European society. His attention and efforts were directed at kings and high ranking ministers. DAlembert worked behind the scenes and inside the more common areas of French society. He employed his skill in the cafes and academies and attempted to bring more followers to the conspiracy. Barruel takes a close look at the correspondence between Voltaire and dAlembert and uses this as evidence of their plot to overthrow society. He is deeply concerned with the fact that those he identifies as the leaders of the plot had secret names for one another in their private correspondence. Voltaire was \"Raton\", dAlembert was \"Protagoras\", Frederick was \"Luc\", and Diderot was known as \"Plato\". Barruel also argued that the conspiracy extended far beyond this small group of philosophes. He believed that the court of Louis XV was a \"Voltairean ministry\" of powerful men. This group involved Marquis dArgenson who \"formed the plan for the destruction of all religious orders in France\", the Duc de Choiseul who was \"the most impious and most despotic of ministers\", the \"friend and confidant of dAlembert\", Archbishop de Briennes, and Malesherbes, \"protector of the conspiracy\". According to Barruel, this group of influential leaders worked together with a number of adepts who supported the conspiracy. The most important adept that Barruel identifies is Condorcet. Barruel claimed that Condorcet was a Freemason and leading member of the Society of 1789 who was elected to the Legislative Assembly and was \"the most resolute atheist\". Condorcet was important because he embodied everything that Barruel claimed the conspiracy was. He was a Freemason that associated with the philospohes and who would become an influential member of the revolution process. Barruel also lists the Baron dHolbach, Buffon, La Mettrie, Raynal, Abbé Yvon, Abbé de Prades, Abbé Morrelet, La Harpe, Marmontel, Bergier and Duclos among the members of the \"synagogue of impiety\".",

    " In South Africa under apartheid, Mehring is a rich white businessman who is not satisfied with his life. His ex-wife has gone to America, his liberal son (who is probably gay) criticizes his conservative/capitalist ways and his lovers and colleagues do not seem actually interested in him. Out of a whim he buys a farm outside the city, afterwards trying to explain this purchase to himself as the search for a higher meaning in life. But it is clear that he knows next to nothing to farming, and that black workers run it - Mehring is simply an outsider, an intruder on the daily life of \"his\" farm. One day the black foreman, Jacobus, finds an unidentified dead body on the farm. Since the dead man is black, the police find no urgency to look into the case and simply bury the body on the spot where it was found. The idea of an unknown black man buried on his land begins to \"haunt\" Mehring. This has been interpreted as the influence of apartheid on the class of privileged white people who profit from it while ignoring its victims. A flood brings the body back to the surface; although the farm workers do not know the stranger, they now give him a proper burial as if he were a family member. There are hints that Mehring's own burial will be less emotional than this burial of a stranger. This can be interpreted to symbolize the white man's position in South Africa: although he \"owns\" the land on a piece of paper, the black natives have the actual claim on the land. it:Il conservatore",

When the company arrive in Brighton for a one-week run at the Theatre Royal, Flood is confident that he will be able to use his stay to get in touch with his estranged wife Jenny, who has filed for divorce and is now living with Roger Colborn, a local businessman, on the outskirts of the city. Flood is surprised to find that it is Jenny who contacts him first: She tells him she is being stalked and, as she believes that her husband is to blame for it, asks him to do something about it. This is how Flood meets Derek Oswin, the alleged stalker, an eccentric man his own age who, just like his deceased father and grandfather before him, worked for the Colborns' family business until its liquidation in 1989. It turns out Oswin has written a history of the company but so far has not found a publisher. Talking to Oswin and to other people he meets, either by chance or by design, Flood more and more gets the impression that Roger Colborn is a dangerous man who has something to hide, and that Jenny must be saved from the clutches of the Colborn family before it is too late. Thus, Flood's interest in the affairs of a now defunct company is fuelled by his desire to win back Jenny, so much so that his professional life is affected. Trying to dig up dirt on the Colborns, he is drawn into a quagmire of events he cannot make head or tail of and eventually misses an evening's performance without giving any notice. When, however, on the following day he finds his understudy&mdash;the man who saved his neck the previous night&mdash;dead in the streets of Brighton he realizes the seriousness of the situation. In the course of one week homes are broken into, evidence is stolen, several people die, family secrets are uncovered, and an inheritance is reclaimed. Justice triumphs in the end.",
    " Shortly before noon on Saturday October 21 of an unspecified year after 2012 (evident by mention of a faded bumper sticker for Barack Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign), the small Maine town of Chester's Mill is abruptly and gruesomely separated from the outside world by an invisible, semipermeable barrier of unknown origin. The immediate appearance of the barrier causes a number of injuries and fatalities, and traps former Army Captain Dale \"Barbie\" Barbara—who is trying to leave Chester's Mill—inside the town. Police Chief Howard \"Duke\" Perkins is soon killed when his pacemaker explodes after getting too close to the barrier. This removes the last significant opposition to James \"Big Jim\" Rennie, used car salesman and the town's Second Selectman. Big Jim exerts significant influence within Chester's Mill, and seizes the opportunity to use the barrier as part of a power play to take over the town. Big Jim appoints one of his cronies, the incompetent Peter Randolph, as the new Police Chief. He also begins expanding the ranks of the Chester's Mill Police with questionable candidates, including his son, Junior Rennie, and his friends. Junior has frequent migraines caused by an as-yet undiscovered brain tumor which has also begun affecting his mental state; unbeknownst to Big Jim, Junior was in the process of beating and strangling a girl to death when the barrier appeared, and has killed another girl by the time Rennie places him on the police force. Elsewhere in Chester's Mill, Julia Shumway, the editor of the local newspaper, is phoned by Colonel James O. Cox, who has her carry a message to Barbie to contact him. When he does, Cox requests that Barbie act as the government's liaison in an effort to bring down the Dome, as it has come to be known. Because of Barbie's talents as a former bomb factory hunter, Cox gives him the task of locating the source, which is believed to be inside the Dome. Cox is also able to foresee the small town political ramifications of such a situation. By virtue of a Presidential order, Barbie is reinstated in the US Military and promoted to full Colonel. Barbie is also presented with a decree granting him authority over the township. However, smalltown politics being what they are, this action is not well received by Big Jim and his misguided band of renegade police officers. As Big Jim covertly encourages and orchestrates unease and panic among the town to build up his grab for power, Barbie, Julia and a number of other townspeople attempt to stop things from spiraling out of control. After crossing Rennie's path on several occasions, Barbie is framed and arrested for 4 murders. He is accused of killing Reverend Lester Coggins, who laundered money for Rennie's large-scale methamphetamine operation, and Duke's widow Brenda Perkins, who were both murdered by Big Jim. While Barbie is in jail other residents track the source of the Dome to an abandoned farm, and the device is strongly indicated to be extraterrestrial in origin. The restrictions issued by Rennie become more severe and the police force grows more abusive, galvanizing the town and eventually leading some residents to break Barbie out of jail, killing Junior seconds before he can murder Barbie. The semi-organized resistance flees to the abandoned farm, where multiple people touch the strange object and experience visions. They not only conclude that the device was put in place by extraterrestrial \"leatherheads\" (so named for their appearance), but that specifically they are juveniles who have set up the Dome as a cruel form of entertainment, a sort of ant farm used to capture sentient beings and allow their captors to view everything that happens inside. On an organized \"Visitors Day\"—when people outside the Dome can meet at its edge with people within—Big Jim sends Randolph and a detachment of police to take back control of his former meth operation from Phil \"Chef\" Bushey, who is stopping Rennie from covering up the operation as well as hoarding the more than four-hundred tanks of propane stored there. Many are killed in the ensuing gunfight and Chef, who is mortally wounded, detonates a plastic explosive device he has placed in the meth production facility. The ensuing explosion, combined with the propane and meth-making chemicals, unleashes a toxic firestorm. More than a thousand of the town's residents are quickly incinerated on national television, leaving alive only the twenty-six survivors at the abandoned barn, an orphaned farm boy hiding in a potato cellar, and Big Jim and his informal aide-de-camp, Carter Thibodeau, in the town's fallout shelter. Big Jim and Thibodeau eventually turn on each other; Big Jim stabs and disembowels Thibodeau, only to die several hours later when hallucinations of the dead send him fleeing into the now-toxic environment outside. The survivors at the barn begin to slowly asphyxiate, despite efforts by the Army to force clean air through the walls of the Dome. Barbie and Julia go to the control device to beg their captors to release them. Julia is able to make contact with a single female leatherhead, no longer accompanied by her friends and thus not caught up in their peer pressure. After repeatedly expressing that they are real sentient beings with real \"little lives\", and by sharing a painful childhood incident with the adolescent alien, Julia convinces the leatherhead to have pity on them. The Dome raises up slowly and vanishes, allowing the toxic air to dissipate and finally freeing the town of Chester's Mill.",

It can be read simultaneously as an unusual, charming love story, a description of the political and social forces at work in 1920s Brazil, a somewhat satirical depiction of Latin American aspirations to \"modernity\", and a celebration of the local culture and pleasures of Bahia. The book was made into series for Brazilian television in 1960, in 1976 and again in 2012. A feature film of the novel was directed by Bruno Barreto in 1983. The feature version starred Sonia Braga as Gabriela and Marcello Mastroianni as Nacib, and featured original music by Antonio Carlos Jobim.",
    " As a restless high school athlete in a small, unnamed town in North Carolina, Jason Maddox, the book's narrator, has a sexual encounter with his popular girlfriend’s alcoholic mother. Rumors of the encounter circulate at school, and Jason’s girlfriend, distraught when she learns of them, attempts suicide. Jason, himself previously popular, is shunned by his classmates, including the one who started the rumors. Jason confronts and savagely beats that classmate, and in the aftermath, he's arrested, expelled from school, and all but disowned by his conservative, mortified parents. Taking a job as a house painter, Jason moves into an apartment complex where he befriends his new neighbor, Bernard “Peewee” Mash, an intellectually precocious fifteen-year-old who, like Jason, is a local pariah. Peewee introduces Jason to art, literature, and, most importantly, punk rock. He and Jason are particularly enamored of the Los Angeles punk band Rule of Thumb, which is led by a Berkeley-educated poet, Jim Cassady, whom Jason and Peewee both revere. Learning that Rule of Thumb will be performing at New York City’s CBGB, Jason quits his job in order to drive himself and Peewee to New York. After the show, they speak to Jim Cassady, who advises them to start a band. They immediately make plans to move to Manhattan, where they live on the Lower East Side, center of the New York punk scene. There, Peewee becomes increasingly difficult, at odds with Jason musically and envious of Jason’s sexual prowess. Alternately given to tantrums and sullen silences, Peewee is ousted from the band that he co-founded. He and Jason pursue music separately until, recognizing how much they miss each other, they reconcile and start a new band. The new band has a growing reputation for its explosive, destructive shows, which result in injuries to person and property alike. Banned from most local venues, the band begins touring the U.S., and in the midst of what will prove to be its final tour, Peewee is killed in a car crash, with Jason narrowly surviving. Devastated by the loss of Peewee, Jason decides he’s finished with music, and, using money from an insurance settlement, he produces and directs a film that takes him to Los Angeles, where he falls in love with an aspiring actress who is herself seeking a new life after fleeing the civil wars in her native Yugoslavia. The actress, Irina, is married to a wealthy Englishman who is happily unaware of her affair with Jason and, possibly, others prior, though Irina denies any previous affairs to Jason. Their stormy romance is addictive to Jason, who begs Irina to leave her husband for him. She repeatedly, and emptily, assures him she will. At a party one night, Jason meets another former punk who tells him that Jim Cassady has recently been spotted, homeless and panhandling on the streets of Hollywood. This is the first sighting of Cassady, as far as Jason knows, since Rule of Thumb disbanded in the early 80s. Jason has always been mystified and intrigued by Cassady’s disappearance, and, on the Internet, he reads of other alleged Cassady sightings. Determined to find Cassady, Jason discovers that he’s now living in a bleak Los Angeles suburb with his elderly, controlling mother. He shares some of his recent songs and poems with Jason, who thinks they're deserving of a wide audience. Except for Cassady's music and the advice he gave Jason and Peewee at CBGB almost twenty years before, Jason might still be miserable in North Carolina, and he means to express his gratitude by helping Cassady gain a new following. But Cassady is resigned to obscurity, and he grudgingly submits to Jason’s efforts on his behalf. Perhaps out of spite, he causes a rupture in Jason’s relationship with Irina, and Jason promises to kill him for it, only to reaffirm, in the book's epilogue, how indebted he is to Cassady, who has again changed the course of his life.",
    " As volunteers clean up after a huge outdoor rock concert in Yorkshire in 1969, they discover the body of a young woman wrapped in a sleeping bag. She has been brutally murdered. The detective assigned to the case, Stanley Chadwick, is a hard-headed, strait-laced veteran of the Second World War. He could not have less in common with - or less regard for - young, disrespectful, long-haired hippies, smoking marijuana and listening to the pulsing sounds of rock and roll. But he has a murder to solve, and it looks as if the victim was somehow associated with the up-and-coming psychedelic pastoral band the Mad Hatters. In the present, Inspector Alan Banks is investigating the murder of a freelance music journalist who was working on a feature about the Mad Hatters for MOJO magazine. This is not the first time that the Mad Hatters, now aging rock superstars, have been brushed by tragedy. Banks finds he has to delve into the past to find out exactly what hornets' nest the journalist inadvertently stirred up.",
    " Leonora Eyre, an attractive and elegant, but essentially selfish, middle-aged woman, becomes friendly with antique dealer Humphrey Boyce and his nephew James. Both men are attracted to Leonora, but Leonora prefers the young, good-looking James to the more \"suitable\" Humphrey. While James is away on a buying trip, Leonora discovers to her annoyance that he has been seeing Phoebe, a girl of his own age. Leonora makes use of Humphrey to humiliate Phoebe, and turns out a sitting tenant in order that James can take up a flat in her own house. She does this in an apparent attempt to control his life. While abroad, the bisexual James has begun a relationship with an American, the amoral Ned, who later follows him to London. Ned prises James out of Leonora's grasp, only to reject him for another lover. James attempts a reconciliation with Leonora, but she refuses to give him a second opportunity to hurt her, and settles for the admiration of the less attractive Humphrey. As with all Pym's fiction, the novel contains many literary references, notably to works by Keats, John Milton and Henry James.",
    " The story takes place in Montefiore, Italy in the early 16th century, on the estate of a nobleman named Don Vicente de Nevada. He lives there with his seven year old daughter, Bianca, and a small staff, the two most interesting of which are Primavera, an earthy cook and Fra Ludovico. In the beginning of the novel, de Nevada finds a mirror in a pond near his manor. This mirror was fashioned by dwarves but lost when they left it in the pond to temper. Incidentally, one dwarf spends most of the novel following de Nevada to ask the return of the mirror. Life is good for the family until the day Lucrezia Borgia and her brother, Cesare, decadent children of a pope, come to visit. Cesare sends Vincente on a quest for a holy relic. While he is gone, Bianca becomes a young woman and Lucrezia becomes jealous of the girl's beauty and stealing Cesare's attention from Lucrezia. Eventually she hires a woodsman to kill Bianca. The girl escapes, and runs into seven dwarfs, who are looking for the eighth dwarf and their mirror.",
    " The book describes the construction of an important bridge in Albanian territory at an ungiven time or age. Told by a catholic monk, Gjon (Gjon is a name used by Northern Albanians who were mostly catholic prior to Turkish invasions), the story of the bridge, as seen by Gjon is filled with prissy, unhappy bureaucrats, who take the events at face value without ever trying to understand the larger forces at work. Both the river Ujana e Keqe and the bridge itself are major characters in the book, and they undergo significant transformations. One of the startling events of the book is when a \"volunteer\" is immured inside the bridge in order to make a \"sacrifice\" to the river. The man's face is captured in the plaster that surrounds him, as unforgettable as it is horrifying. Though clearly a punishment for the crime of sabotage against the bridge, as Gjon recounts this event, it is less an act of vengeance than it is a true sacrifice. But more than that, it becomes a symbol for the ignorance of and squabbling among tiny Albanian principalities and their fight amongst one another, in front of a major threat.",
    " The novel describes a world set in the year 2048 after a catastrophe which has fractured the United States into several nations. The protagonists live in San Francisco and have evolved in the direction of Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy, using wind power, local agriculture, and the like. San Francisco is presented as a mostly pagan city where the streets have been torn up for gardens and streams, no one starves or is homeless, and the city's defense council consists primarily of nine elderly women who \"listen and dream\". The novel describes \"a utopia where women are leading societies but are doing so with the consent of men.\" To the south, though, an overtly-theocratic Christian fundamentalist nation has evolved and plans to wage war against the San Franciscans. The novel explores the events before and during the ensuing struggle between the two nations, pitting utopia and dystopia against each other. The basic premise resembles that of Pat Murphy's earlier novel The City, Not Long After. The story is primarily told from the points of view of 98-year-old Maya, her nominal granddaughter Madrone, and her grandson Bird. Through these and other characters, the story explores many elements from ecofeminism and ecotopian fiction.",
    " Renn, a gifted but often bullied Eight Year novice in the Echorium who can speak to Half-Creatures, is asked to assist the Singers by translating for Shaiala Two-Hoof, a wild girl brought to the Island for treatment, who claims to have been raised by centaurs. Although initially the pair argue, meeting Rialle helps to calm Shaiala and she begins to remember, enough to reveal that her memories were wiped using a mask made of khiz. Second Singer Kherron takes this excuse to insist that Shaiala and Renn leave with him to search for Frazhin, the escaped khizpriest whose body was never found. After this revelation, Rialle takes Shaiala, who was very disturbed by her recolllections, and Renn to come to the cave where she lives and meet the merlee. While Shaiala swims with the merlee, Renn rejects their friendly offers and is horrified to learn that \"crazy\" Rialle is his mother. The next day, Renn and Shaiala leave with Kherron on the Wavesong, heading to Southport. On the journey, Renn is irritable and offends Shaiala by refusing to believe her tales of centaurs. Kherron also gives Shaiala a bluestone necklace. Upon arrival, the group begin to explore Southport and Shaiala, despite being closelyguarded by a pentad of orderlies including Frenn and Lazim, escapes, only to become lost in the rough part of the city. She is kidnapped and thrown in a cellar with several street children, and Erihan, the son of Lord Nahar, the leader of the Kalerei tribe of Horselords. The children are taken away by barge towards the Plains. While Kherron attempts to trace Shaiala through her bluestone necklace, they rapidly loose track of the barge. Meanwhile, the children meet \"Aunt Yashra\", a seemingly kindly pregnant woman who asks to hear each child sing, and then chooses some to return to her \"Singing Palace\" while others are to be \"gotten rid of\". This disturbs Shaiala, who recognises Yashra, and causes friction between the children, with many of those chosen wanting to stay. However, after three days of cramped conditions, they hatch a plan to escape. Shaiala kicks a hole in the side of the boat for the children to escape through, but several are left behind as the boat begins to sink, attracting the crew's attention. Shaiala and the other remaining children are taken to Aunt Yashra's camp, where Yashra uses the khiz mask to make them passive. Shaiala remembers the mask and, with Erihan's help, escapes. Shaiala and Erihan steal Yashra's horses and head onto the Plains together to search for tracks - Erihan for Horselord's, Shaiala for centaur's. Meanwhile, Renn is asked to track Shaiala's bluestone, as novices are more sensitive than Singers. Although they follow the barge for a few days, Renn is shocked when the bluestone is suddenly underwater, and he fears Shaiala has drowned. However, the bluestone is soon retrieved by a Half-Creature similar to a merlee, known as a naga. The Singers follow the naga upriver, and eventually arrange a meeting. The naga shows them its collection of 'sparklies' - consisting of Shaiala's bluestone, a piece of khiz and Erihan's dagger. Seeing Erihan's dagger, the Singers are attacked by Lord Nahar and the Kaleri, who have been following the Singers in their search for Erihan. After a brief confrontation, the two groups agree to work together, and the Horselords tell the Singers about the Sunless Valley, reachable only though the Pass of Silence, where they suspect the children have been taken. Renn contacts the naga again and, in exchange for the return of a 'sparkly', it tells them where it found the dagger - with Shaiala's bluestone - and where it found the khiz, in the mountains. However, it leaves before Renn can ask if it knows another way into the Sunless Valley. Meanwhile, Shaiala and Erihan eventually track down Shaiala's herd of centaurs by the Dancing Canyons. Seeing them, Shaiala remembers why no-one else had spotted them - the adults use herdstones to bend light around the herd, rendering it invisible. Shaiala offers to take herdstones to the centaur foals enslaved in the Sunless Valley, and she and Erihan travel there through underwater caves, guided by naga, within which they see khiz crystal poisoning the naga eggs. Meanwhile, the Singers attempt to get through the Pass of Silence, a pass so precarious that the slightest noise can start an avalanche. However, when they are attacked, Renn accidentally cries out, setting off an avalanche. Frenn and another orderly are killed, Kherron is captured, a crystal forced into his throat, and is taken away, and only Renn's quick thinking saves himself and the other orderlies from the second avalanche set off by the Harai guarding the Pass. Grateful, Lazim finally explains how Frazhin disappeared after the Battle of the Merlee twenty years ago, and, although those sent to find his body disappeared, he was not considered a threat after the khiz was destroyed. While the orderlies attempt to disable to gong used to set off avalanches in the Pass of Silence - thereby allowing Lord Nahar and the Kaleri to pass through safely - Renn hides, only to be caught by Yashra as she brings in the captured street children, and be taken to the Khizalace - Yashra's stronghold. However, there is trouble in the Valley - Shaiala and Erihan have arrived to find the captured centaurs working as slaves to mine khiz, and have freed them with herdstones, leading a revolution. The angry foals storm the palace, leaving Shaiala and Erihan no choice but to follow. They get inside the Khizalace, but are soon separated from the centaurs. Instead, they find a group of street children, apparently hypnotised, and follow them to their dormitory, which is dominated by the presence of a giant khiz crystal. Although the pair quickly disable the guards, they are unable to break the crystal's hold on the children, and only just keep from sucumbing themselves. Renn is taken to see Singer Kherron in the dungeons, who is clearly badly injured by the khiz crystal in his throat. Frazhin arrives, and attempts to force Kherron to teach the children in the Khizalace the Songs of Power, scorning the Singer's attempts to break free. Frazhin threatens that if Kherron does not help him, he will harm Renn - whom Frazhin believes to be Kherron's son. It is made clear in the conversation that Yashra's unborn child is Frazhin's. Renn is taken away, but escapes from his guards when he hears of a \"wild centaur girl\" causing havoc in the dormitories. He hurries to find Shaiala attempting to crack the khiz with her kicks, and helps her to crack the crystal and free the children. With the Khizalace shattering around them from the blow, the Harai flee, and Shaiala and Renn hurry to free Kherron, whose voice is badly damaged from the crystal, then join the battle outside. With the arrival of the Kaleri, the battle has turned in the Singer's favour, at least until Yashra appears and seals the gates against them with khiz power, trapping them inside. Although she seems victorious, capturing Erihan as a hostage and controlling the khiz against the Kaleri, she is distracted when Singer Kherron warns her to keep an eye on Frazhin, who is trying to escape without her. She hurries after him, and between Renn's singing and the centaur's kicks, the gates are destroyed. When the group catches up to Yashra, she is watching from the lakeshore as Frazhin on a boat in the centaur calls to the naga. Although they help him initially, they suddenly turn on him and pull him under the water. Yashra, trapped by the Singers, is offered a choice: immediate execution or life on the Echorium until her child is born followed by a course of Yehn. She chooses the Echorium, for the sake of her child, and protests before she is taken away that Frazhin's crimes are the Singer's fault, for destroying his hopes of joining them when he was a child. After leaving the valley, Shaiala and Renn forget their earlier disagreements, and with Renn's singing to assist her, Shaiala successfully cracks rock to find her own herdstone. A songless Kherron, after reporting to the Echorium with Renn's help, admits that, while he would be glad to call himself Renn's father, Rialle had a close relationship with Frenn - who Renn was named for - and Renn's parentage is uncertain. Shaiala joins the Kaleri to learn to be a tribeswoman from Erihan's mother, and Renn returns to the Echorium, where he reconciles with Rialle and the merlee.",
    " The Hunter, an alien lifeform (when not inside another being, resembling a four-pound green jellyfish) with the ability to live in symbiosis with and within another creature, is in hot pursuit of another of his kind. Both crash their ships into Earth, in the Pacific Ocean, and both survive the crashes. The Hunter makes its way to shore (its erstwhile host having been killed in the crash) and takes up residence in the nearest human being it can find (as it turns out, fifteen-year-old Robert Kinnaird) without letting the human being know. By the time it has figured out enough of what goes on inside a human being to look through Bob's eyes, it is shocked to find itself within an air vessel, being carried further away from its quarry every second. As it happens, Bob is simply returning to a New England boarding school from his home on an industrial island in the Western Pacific. Once Bob arrives at school, the Hunter sees no alternative to communicating with his host. After initial attempts produce panic in the boy, the Hunter eventually finds a way to convince Bob of his presence. Bob is very accepting of his guest, perhaps beyond what would be expected of a teenage boy who learns another entity is inside him, observing his every move. The two plot a way to return home. The puzzle distracts Bob from his studies, leading to a decline in grades that the school authorities ascribe to homesickness, and he is sent home for the remainder of the term. Upon arrival, the two begin to seek out their quarry. Bob is injured by an accident. The Hunter is able to hold the wound together, but he can't stop Bob from limping, and Bob is sent to the island doctor. They see no alternative to confiding in the doctor (the Hunter is forced to show his own form to convince the man) and the doctor becomes an ally in their search. Which of the many humans on the island is the host to their quarry? It is worse than a needle in a haystack (thus the title) because a needle at least looks like a needle, not a piece of straw. The Hunter is able to solve the riddle by observing the behavior of the island people. Bob's father, known for his attention to detail and safety, has been taking amazing risks. He is at least unconsciously aware that an accident will have no ill consequences. The quarry resides within him. The Hunter confirms this, and Bob and the alien have a new puzzle—how to get the alien out of Mr. Kinnaird's body without harming the man? This time, Bob comes up with the solution. He places himself in the middle of a large number of (empty) oil cans, uses a little actual oil to start a small fire, making it look like there will be a huge explosion shortly, and calls his father for help. The fugitive alien, fearful of being killed in the explosion, knocks out his host and removes himself from Mr. Kinnaird's unconscious body. As soon as the alien is a few feet away from Bob's father, the boy grabs the one full oil can, races over to the alien, pours oil over it, and lights it on fire. He then tends to his father. Mr. Kinnaird is fine, but Bob is worried. He and the Hunter had better come up with a good story for the man, or the Hunter will have to find some way to assuage the pain of a spanking.",

    " The story involves a widow named Minna Shaw. One evening, a witch falls from her broom when it loses the ability to fly and lands in the garden near Minna Shaw's house. Minna Shaw takes her in until she recovers, and when she does, the witch calls a friend to \"drive\" her home, leaving her own broom behind. Minna Shaw discovers the broom is still in her house and leaves it alone but is startled, and more than a little afraid, when it comes to life later that evening. She discovers that the broom is harmless, as all it does is sweep, but she teaches it how to feed the chickens, chop wood, and play the piano. While most of the neighbor women and children are comfortable with the broom, the men are concerned that it had been a witch's broom. Shortly afterwards, two boys begin to harass it. The broom, apparently angered, beats them and flings their dog over the forest. The boys' parents demand that the broom be burned at the stake. Minna Shaw surprisingly agrees, and the broom is burned. Things appear normal until the broom's phantom-white ghost begins stalking the Spiveys' house. The Spiveys are so terrified that they pack up and leave the house. Minna Shaw can now be alone and listen to the broom play the piano; she'd given the Spiveys her own ordinary household broom to burn and cooked up the plan for the magical broom (which was just painted white), to scare her neighbors away. She painted it white to make it look like the \"ghost\" broom.",
    " During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands Anne Frank began to keep a diary on June 14, 1942, two days after her 13th birthday, and twenty two days before going into hiding with her mother Edith Frank, father Otto Frank, sister Margot Frank and three other people, Hermann van Pels, Auguste van Pels, and Peter van Pels. The group went into hiding in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex of her father's office building in Amsterdam. The sealed-off upper-rooms also contained a hidden door behind which the Franks would hide during the parts when Nazi soldiers were investigating the buildings for harbored Jews. Mrs. van Pels' dentist, Fritz Pfeffer, joined them four months later. In the published version, names were changed: the van Pels are known as the Van Daans and Fritz Pfeffer is known as Mr. Dussel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and one month, until their betrayal in August 1944, which resulted in their deportation to Nazi concentration camps. Of the group of eight, only Otto Frank survived the war. Anne died in Bergen-Belsen from a typhus infection in early March, shortly (about two weeks) before liberation by British troops in April 1945.",
    " Jake spends a day having strange flashbacks of himself in a rainforest, which leaves him disturbed. That evening, after watching a boxing match with his brother and father, he leaves for a grocery store, where Tobias has discovered something has crashed and the high-ranking yeerks are trying to hide something. The other Animorphs join them, and together they infiltrate the store in fly morph. Cassie overhears Chapman saying that it was a Yeerk bug fighter. After Ax manages to reconfigure the ship's controls, the Animorphs escape, pursued by Chapman and the other Yeerks. They plan to fly the spacecraft to Washington, in order to convince the American government that Earth is under attack by extraterrestrials. When Ax discovers that the fighter's technology to keep human radar from seeing it is broken, they are intercepted by two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets, however, Cassie notices that they are over the Red Sea in the Middle East - far from their intended destination. Flying above the atmosphere, they are picked up by Visser Three's Blade ship sensors. The Animorphs, knowing they can't escape, try to fire on the Visser's vessel. Both Jake and the Blade ship fire their Dracon beams at the same time, and, coincidentally, their projectiles intersect, and both ships crash. The kids wake up in their wrecked Bug fighter. They look around, noticing that they've crash-landed in a rainforest. They assume they're in the Amazon rainforest, but are also disturbed by the fact that it is the middle of the day (whereas it was nighttime in the United States, which is in roughly the same time zone as South America). After Jake reveals the strange flashbacks he was having, Ax speculates they may have caused a \"Sario Rip\" and traveled twelve hours backwards through time, which would explain why Jake was having strange flashbacks: he was in two places at once, and the two Jakes---the \"past\" and \"future\" versions---experience each other's thoughts at random moments. However, Cassie later notices that only Jake has the flashes so Ax says that Jake is the only \"real\" person-the rest are just a memory. They soon find that the Yeerks have traveled backwards through time as well, and will need both ships to create another Sario Rip and return to the right time. Ax takes the Bug fighter's computer to prevent them from doing so, and the group ventures out into the hostile wilderness, constantly plagued by insects, fire ants, snakes and piranhas. They're pursued by the Yeerks, who ruthlessly destroy the animals and trees around them in a bid to kill the Animorphs, desperate to retrieve the precious computer. The children acquire jaguar and monkey morphs in order to traverse the rainforest more easily. They eventually stumble across a group of Amazon Indians, led by Polo, their tribal chief. Marco, who knows some Spanish, manages to roughly translate the natives' Portuguese, and Jake and Polo agree to assist one another in eliminating the Yeerks. Polo and his men kill the Hork-Bajir guarding the Blade ship with poison-tipped spears, leaving the Animorphs with Visser Three, who morphs an amphibian-like Lerdethak and picks the Animorphs off one by one. Jake morphs into a monkey to use the Ledethak's vine like arms to move himself to Visser Three's body. He then throws a poison-tipped spear into Visser Three: while never revealed, this may have been fatal. Regardless, Visser Three is still able to use an arm to break Jake's neck. However, Jake wakes up back at the grocery store, just as they are about to infiltrate it. He calls off the operation, and the Animorphs all go home. The next day Jake asks Ax what had happened. Ax postulates that the travel through time created two separate versions of Jake. The reason Jake simply \"woke up\" back at the grocery store was that the Jake in the rainforest died at the hands of Visser Three; since it is impossible for one consciousness to exist in two separate locations, when one was eliminated the two snapped back together. Ax also speculates that Jake had to die, or else both Jakes and both their universes would collide and cease to exist. The events in the rainforest never actually happened (including the acquisition of jaguar and monkey morphs), and only remain in Jake's memory. He is left with a feeling of chilling relief. *Sario Rips are introduced and explained.",

Figuring that it will reincarnate him if he changes it to plus and jumps in, he does so. It is left to the reader to decide whether Connor and Scrote were reincarnated or were fully annihilated.",
    " Count von Count and other Muppets are returning from a country drive in the Countmobile. But, in classic suspense/horror movie fashion, the bridge is out, so the group has to spend the night at a spooky old house. A giant monster butler escorts each character to a room, decorated entirely in one of the seven colors of the rainbow. No one is especially gruntled by their accommodations: Cookie Monster longs for a green cookie to go well with his green room, while the Count von Count does not like his red room (not one little bit of it), Ernie is not too thrilled with his purple room, Oscar the Grouch finds himself trapped in a bright pink room, filled with flowers and hearts, while Bert longs for a beige room over an orange one, Betty Lou is blinded by yellow, and even Grover finds himself depressed by his matching blue room. The group rapidly depart the next morning, happy to leave the weird house and return. The Sesame Street residents are unaware that the House of Seven Colors is in fact a tourist attraction, frequented by vast car and busloads of monsters who feel right at home in rooms that match their fur.",
    " The novel is narrated by Alexias, a noble Athenian youth, who becomes a noted beauty in the city and a champion runner. The novel suggests that young male Athenians were treated almost like modern debutantes and wooed by older men seeking to be their lovers; in fact, in a memorable passage, Alexias' father, Myron, himself a former beauty and champion athlete, writes to his son before leaving Athens for the Sicilian Expedition. The father imparts to the son the traits he should seek in a lover – qualities like honor, loyalty and courage. However, the father also warns the son not to become involved with women as he is much too young. (See Athenian pederasty.) The book implies that Myron had been Alcibiades' lover when the latter was a teenager, and felt that the way that Alcibiades turned out was at partly Myron's fault at least, as it was his responsibility as a lover to teach his eromenos virtue. As an Ephebe (adolescent male), Alexias falls in love with Lysis, a man in his 20s – a champion pankratiast and a student of Socrates. The novel follows their the relationship through the Peloponnesian War, the surrender of Athens, the establishment of the Thirty Tyrants rule over Athens, the democratic rebellion of Thrasybulus and shortly after. The story ends with first hints of the eventual trial of Socrates for teaching blasphemy and sowing social disorder. From the beginning of the novel, Socrates figures prominently; both Alexis and Lysis become his students in their youth. Also characterized in the novel are Plato and several figures from his Dialogues who were Socrates' students, including Xenophon. Another historical figure who figures in the story, albeit mostly off-stage, is Alcibiades, the Athenian general who flees Athens on a charge of sacrilege and functions as a military adviser to Sparta until he is recalled by a resurgent democracy in Athens. Alexis and Lysis serve under Alcibiades' command until his carelessness leads the fleet to disaster and he once again goes into exile. In the course of the novel, Lysis falls in love with and marries a woman who sees Alexias favorably and encourages the continuation of her husband's relationship with him. Not long after this, Athens is defeated by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Alexias' father is murdered under the Spartan-installed tyranny, and he and Lysis go into exile in Thebes joining Thrasybulus when he leads the next democratic revolt. Lysis is killed in the battle between the Long Walls running from the port of Piraeus to Athens (the Battle of Munychia). Shortly after the victory, Alexias takes Lysis' widow under his protection, marries her and continues his family line. The book ends with the postscript that this story (incomplete and long-forgotten) has been found by Alexias' grandson (also named Alexias), a commander of Athenian cavalry in the service of Alexander the Great.",

    " Jango begins with Seeker, Morning Star and Wildman who are all being taught in the Nom and are near the end of their training. Their teacher, Chance, mentions the secret skill of a Noble Warrior, and tells them a new teacher will be assigned to them to help them attain this secret skill. He then hands them over to Miriander, who puts them through training to learn how to control another's will by using lir. Once this training is over, it is discovered that Seeker has power without limits. Unlike the other Noble Warriors, he is able to suck the lir out of any living thing and doesn't get weary doing so. He fights and defeats Chance. Afterwards, he is told to stay in one place while the Elder and the council of the Nomana decide what to do with him, as they feel that they should not loose such power in the world, yet he might be the one the save the Nomana. In the trees of the forest called the Glimmen lives Echo Kittle who is described as being pale, slender and beautiful. She is captured by the Orlan leader, Amroth Jahan, who intends to arrange a marriage between her and one of his sons. She refuses to do so until the Jahan threatens to burn down the Glimmen and kill everyone in it. She decides to go along with them and soon they arrive in Radiance, which is led by Soren Similin. After a series of events taking up more than half the book, Similin manages to form an alliance between the Jahan and Radiance so they can destroy Anacrea with the use of charged water, which has huge explosive power. Neither the Jahan or Radiance intends to share the victory with the other. In his cell, Seeker is told by a Noma, Narrow Path, that the council of the Nom has decided to cleanse Seeker. Narrow Path believes this is the wrong decision and, knowing that he himself will be cleansed for this act, sets Seeker free, and tells him that he must go and fight the true threat; the Savanters, whom live in the land cloud. Seeker heads off to the land cloud, which is on the opposite side of the Glimmen, and on the way there he meets Jango sitting by a strange door in a broken down wall. At first, Jango seems to be a crazy old man, until he begins citing many of Seeker's personal thoughts. He gives Seeker much cryptic advice on how to defeat the Savanters and cites Noman's famous quote. (see Noman's experiment). Seeker continues on his way through the Glimmen but is stopped by Echo Kittle who has escaped from the Orlans in Radiance. She pleads with Seeker to help her defend the Glimmen from the Orlans but Seeker, knowing that he has little time left, refuses and carries on his way into the land cloud. There he kills five out of seven savanters but he is told to go back by a black figure, pretending to be his shadow. Seeker feels that something bad is happening at the Nom so he runs back as fast as he can. When Seeker arrives back at the Nom, the army of Orlans has already attacked and the charged water bomb ready to blow up the city, although Seeker doesn't know this. Seeker drives his power into the ground, causing an earthquake that stopped the battle in an instant, but the charged water bomb had already been launched at Anacrea and destroyed it, along with the Garden and the Lost Child. Seeker gets angry and takes revenge on the Jahan by breaking his pride, forcing him to kneel to Echo Kittle. The army of Orlans breaks up and Soren Similin dies from a charged water explosion. Seeker heads out in search of a purpose and runs across Jango, who is standing before a door. Jango says the door is open and he can enter if he wishes. Before he enters, he is told by Jango that there are many more Noms, and so he realizes the All and Only is not dead. The book is ended when Seeker enters the strange door next to Jango and enters an exact replica of the Nom's Garden that he was used to. He kneels down and asks for forgiveness for disbelieving in him after the destruction of the Nom.",
    " Mixing history and legend, it presents a situation in which pagan and Christianized Basques unite under the first king of Navarre and ally with Pelayo, the first king of Asturias to defend Catholic Iberia against the invading hordes of Islam. Amaya is a Christian noblewoman, daughter of a Basque woman and Ranimiro, the ruthless Visigoth general. She is a niece to pagan leader Amagoya, who prefers her other pagan niece as heiress to the secrets of Aitor, the Basque ancestral patriarch. Pacomio is a machinating Jew conspirating in disguise among Muslims, Visigoths and Basques. Eudes, duke of Cantabria, is Pacomio's son, but, by hiding his Jewish origin, has reached a high post in the Visigoth kingdom and aspires to power beyond what his allies and his father would allow. At the end, the secret of Aitor is revealed, to recommend Christianity, the pagan Basques (except for Amagoya) convert, and Amaya marries the Basque resistance leader, García, becoming the first monarchs of Navarre.

    " It is the story of a young Bengali man’s adventures in Africa in the years 1909-1910. Shankar, the protagonist, is a 20 year old man, recently graduated from college and about to take up a job in a jute mill, a prospect he absolutely loathes. He yearns for adventure, wild lands, forests and animals. He wants to follow the footsteps of famous explorers like Livingstone, Mungo Park, Marco Polo, all of whom he has read about and idolizes. By a stroke of luck, he secures a job as a clerk in Uganda Railways through a fellow villager already working there and goes to Africa without a second thought. There, he spends a few months laying rail tracks but soon encounters the first of many dangers of Pre-World War I Africa—man-eating lions. Later he takes up a job as station master in desolate station. Here he encounters the another hazard in Africa: the poisonous black mamba. He also rescues and looks after the middle-aged Portuguese explorer and gold prospector, Diego Alvarez. The encounter with Alavarez influences him deeply. Alavarez tells him of his earlier exploits and adventures, how he and his companion Jim Carter had braved deep jungles and mountains of Richtersveld to find the largest diamond mine. However, they were thwarted by the legendary Bunyip, a mythical monster which guards the mines which killed Carter. Shankar gives up his job and accompanies Alvarez as he decides to venture out once more and find the mines again. They meet with innumerable hardships, a raging volcano being the greatest challenge. Eventually they get lost in the forests where Alvarez is killed by a mysterious monster, the same that had taken Carter’s life, the Bunyip. Shankar sets out to reach civilization. He finds the Bunyip's cave and the diamond mines by accident. He enters the cave but eventually gets lost. With great difficulty, he gets out, marking his way with \"pebbles\" and taking some back with him as memento, not knowing each is a piece of uncut diamond. He finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave he found earlier really was the diamond mine. Gatti, as Shankar learns from a note by him, had uncut diamonds in his boots. The note said that whoever reads the note can take the diamonds as long as he buries his skeleton, with Christian rites. Shankar does so, and keeps the old diamonds. He becomes lost in the deserts of Kalahari and nearly dies of thirst. Fortunately he is rescued by a survey team, and taken to a hospital in Salisbury, Rhodesia, from where he sets sail for home. He ends the book saying that he will return to that cave one day with a large team, and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter and Gatti.",
    "Robert De Niro has completed a transatlantic box office double by topping the UK and US film charts with two different films at the same time.\nComedy sequel Meet the Fockers, in which he stars with Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, shot to the top of the UK chart at the weekend. It took £7.2m in three days - eight times more than the number two, Closer. Assault on Precinct 13 was in third. At the same time, US audiences were won over by his new thriller Hide and Seek. In Meet the Fockers, he picks up the role of an uptight father and ex-CIA agent from 2000 hit comedy, Meet the Parents.\nIt is a big leap to his role in Hide and Seek, a supernatural horror in which he plays a widower whose daughter's imaginary friend turns nasty. In the UK box office chart, Meet the Fockers pushed Closer off the top spot while police action movie Assault On Precinct 13, starring rapper Ja Rule, made £750,000 in its first weekend. London Underground thriller Creep was another new entry at six while quirky comedy Sideways, which got five Oscar nominations last week, entered in eighth place. The Oscar nominations do not seem to have had an impact on fans' choices at cinemas. Leading contenders The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Ray all suffered substantial drops in takings compared with the previous weekend.",
    "The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy (DOE) lab. DOE test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The current top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocks up 35.86. Due next week, the Top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second. The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles.\nThe US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the Linpack benchmark. Until the official list is published, however, Blue Gene/L's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries. But the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. Surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time.\nThe IBM Blue Gene/L is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the Livermore labs in 2005. Its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. The final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. The Earth Simulator has held on to the top spot since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. But in September, IBM said that another Blue Gene/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulator's performance. This was achieved during internal testing at IBM's production facility in Rochester, Minnesota, though, so was not an official record. Another giant to enter the fray is Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California. It would be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in October.\nSupercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. Their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis. IBM's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, Nick Donofrio, believes that by 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing. This means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second. \"When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world,\" Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website.\n\"You can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative.\" One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing - and Blue Gene machines in particular - as crucial is health. He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st Century: protein folding. \"Health is one of the most important problems, not just mapping the human genome, but also protein structures. \"We are a great believer in simulation. It gives you another tool,\" he said. Once the structures of proteins are understood fully, then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively. Compared with the current fastest supercomputers, Blue Gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact. Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.\nContrack International, of Arlington, Virginia, heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. Its withdrawal from the $325m (£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon's Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack's management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\nUS firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"",
    "The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.\nCommission officials are to look at Rome's provision of a 400m euro ($495m; £275m) loan to the carrier. Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. The investigation could take up to 18 months. However, Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot said he wanted it to be carried out as swiftly as possible. \"The Italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan,\" said Mr Barot. \"We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. I would like our analysis to be completed swiftly.\"\nThe matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia. While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. Alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. It plans to split into AZ Fly and AZ Services, which will handle air and ground services respectively. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. EU rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the \"one time, last time\" rule for airlines. Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. The airline declined to comment on the Commission decision.",
    "Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.\nThe Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be \"limited\". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and \"add-ons\" that the software giant offers.\nPeople who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.\nMicrosoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. \"It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,\" he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. \"China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,\" said Mr Cluley.",
    "The debut of US television hit Desperate Housewives has helped lift Channel 4's January audience share by 12% compared to last year.\nOther successes such as Celebrity Big Brother and The Simpsons have enabled the broadcaster to surpass BBC2 for the first month since last July. However the channel's share of the audience fell from 11.2% to 9.6% last month in comparison with January 2004. Celebrity Big Brother attracted less viewers than its 2002 series.\nComedy drama Desperate Housewives managed to pull in five million viewers at one point during its run to date, attracting a quarter of the television audience. The two main television channels, BBC1 and ITV1, have both seen their monthly audience share decline in a year on year comparison for January, while Five's proportion remained the same at a slender 6.3%. Digital multi-channel TV is continuing to be the strongest area of growth, with the BBC reporting Freeview box ownership of five million, including one million sales in the last portion of 2004. Its share of the audience soared by 20% in January 2005 compared with last year, and currently stands at an average of 28.6%.",
    "Video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004.\nGamers spent more than £1.34bn in 2004, almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the UK gaming industry's trade body. Sales records were smashed by the top title of the year GTA: San Andreas - in which players got the job of turning central character CJ into a crime boss. The game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale. This feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the UK. Although only released in November the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. There were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies. Five titles, including Sony EyeToy Play and EA's Need for Speed: Underground 2, managed this feat according to figures compiled by Chart-Track for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (Elspa). Electronic Arts, the world's biggest games publisher, had 9 games in the top 20.\n2004 was a \"stellar year\" said Roger Bennett, director general of Elspa. \"In a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,\" he said. Part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. Halo, The Sims, Driver, Need for Speed, Fifa football, Burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. Despite this fondness for older games, Doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. Movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. Games linked to Shrek, The Incredibles, Spider-Man, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings were all in the top 20. Elspa noted that sales of Xbox games rose 37.9% during the year. However, Sony's PlayStation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the £1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. Despite winning awards and rave reviews Half-Life 2 did not appear in the list. This was because it was only released on PC and, compared to console titles, sold in relatively small numbers. Also the novel distribution system adopted by developer Valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. Valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.",

    "French president Jacques Chirac has called the UK's £3bn rebate from the European Union \"unjustified\".\nSpeaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the EU would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. He said it remained justified because less EU farm money came to the UK.\nMr Chirac told reporters in Brussels: \"One can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the British cheque. It can no longer be justified. It was from the past.\" But a UK Government official responded: \"Even with the rebate, the UK pays two and a half times more than France contributes to the EU budget. Without it we would pay 14 times as much as France. \"There can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.\"\nThe 25-member EU is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013, with the bloc's Luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a June summit. Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a \"crucial test\" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain. EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.\nThe UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. Mr Straw has said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: \"I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe.\n\"The UK is already one of the biggest net contributors to the EU .\" The foreign secretary meanwhile said the \"justice\" of the rebate remained. \"We have one of the lowest net receipts of any EU country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. \"That continues to be the case.\"\nUK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was \"set in stone\" and there was no reason to negotiate about it. \"It is extraordinary to do it at this time, just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the EU. If we lose our rebate as well, the British taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that I think everyone will go off the European project.\" EU leaders are holding talks in Brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish European economy. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is meeting his EU counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the European Constitution. The plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. Critics - including Germany and France - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in Eastern Europe, undercutting large EU economies and undermining social protections. There are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern European countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in Germany.\nMr Straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate. \"European countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods,\" he said. \"What we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.\" Britain's low unemployment meant there was less \"neurosis\" about people coming from eastern European countries. \"In countries like Germany and France, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in,\" he said.",
    "China lent Russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.\nThe Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China's CNPC.\nAccording to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk's former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. \"The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,\" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. \"There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.\"\nThe announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.\nThe embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country's richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\nThe deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China's thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. \"Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],\" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. \"They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.\" \"If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,\" Mr Lukashov continued. \"And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it's a good deal for them too.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "(after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)\nJohn Arne Riise volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but Steven Gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. Blues boss Jose Mourinho was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. Drogba and Kezman scored from close range before Antonio Nunez's header made for a tense finale. It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager. Yet it was controversial too, after Mourinho's sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.\nRiise could not have connected any better with Morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past Petr Cech. The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampard's powerfully-struck drive and Drogba's low shot. Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpool's well-organised defence.\nJoe Cole had a shot blocked and a promising Damien Duff break was halted by a good tackle from Djimi Traore, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from Gudjohnsen's header, then to smother William Gallas' follow-up. And despite Chelsea's possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as Luis Garcia fed Dietmar Hamann whose shot forced a superb save from Cech. And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. That prompted Mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and Duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. Dudek saved bravely at the Irishman's feet, while Milan Baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. Drogba almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. But seconds after the half-time interval, Drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from Glen Johnson's long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. And Kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after Gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.\nDudek, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore (Biscan 67), Luis Garcia, Gerrard, Hamann, Riise, Kewell (Nunez 56), Morientes (Baros 74).\nSubs Not Used: Pellegrino, Carson.\nHyypia, Traore, Hamann, Carragher.\nRiise 1, Nunez 113.\nCech, Paulo Ferreira, Ricardo Carvalho, Terry, Gallas (Kezman 74), Jarosik (Gudjohnsen 45), Lampard, Makelele, Cole (Johnson 81), Drogba, Duff.\nSubs Not Used: Pidgeley, Tiago.\nLampard, Kezman, Drogba, Duff.\nGerrard 79 og, Drogba 107, Kezman 112.\n78,000\nS Bennett (Kent).",
    "The Conservative Party would deal \"sympathetically\" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.\nDr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for \"vindictiveness\" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.\nA jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.\nHe won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. Dr Fox was asked if he would say yes or no if Lord Archer applied to rejoin. \"I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. \"I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell.\"\nTory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. \"After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,\" he added. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. He said: \"I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. But there is no doubt it would be controversial.\" Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.",
    "Investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced.\nEighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\nFurther details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. \"This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,\" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA's 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another's share prices.\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned.\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to end its Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) on midnight of 31 December. Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\nIt added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.",

    "Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a \"super union\" of two million members.\nThe move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that \"nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda\" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday.

    "Tony Blair should set out a proper exit strategy from Iraq in the wake of next Sunday's elections in the country, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.\nIn a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of George W Bush, Mr Kennedy said Iraq had become a \"crucible of militant terrorism\". He wants to see a phased withdrawal of UK troops \"as soon as the situation allows\", he said in London. Any exit strategy must \"augment and support\" the democratic process.\n\"There are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of British and American troops in Iraq feeds the insurgency,\" he said. \"There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.\" Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal \"regardless of the situation on the ground\".\nHe accused Mr Blair's government of \"being less than straightforward\" over its plans. \"Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq,\" Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech. \"He should set out a proper exit strategy, including the phased withdrawal of British troops, as the security situation allows.\" Mr Kennedy also argued that British troops deployed in Iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - \"especially Islamic countries\".",
    "Amelie Mauresmo and Maria Sharapova won their opening matches at the Tour Championships in Los Angeles.\nFrance's Mauresmo routed Vera Zvonareva 6-1 6-0, while Wimbledon champion Sharapova was a 6-1 6-4 winner over fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. American Serena Williams also won, edging Russian Elena Dementieva 7-6 7-5 for her second victory of the event. The event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.\nMauresmo's win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the number one spot. Mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the US Open before injury ushered Davenport back in front. \"Since then, I feel very confident on court and my game is there. I want to get the ranking back, but it's very different than before I was number one. \"It was an obsession, but now I take it in a relaxed way.\" Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russia's Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.\n\"She got mad a little bit and I played some great tennis,\" said Mauresmo, who was runner-up to Kim Clijsters in last year's final. Zvonareva has lost both her games so far, having crashed 6-2 6-4 Kuznetsova in the Staples Centre on Wednesday. \"Sometimes not everything works,\" she said. \"It was lots of pressure. Maybe that is why I couldn't do 100%. But I was fighting.\" Sharapova, who lost 6-2 6-2 to Kuznetsova in Beijing in September, said: \"In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable. \"This time, it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.\" The tournament debutant added: \"I love it here. The atmosphere is great. \"To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball.\" Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. \"It's hard to go out there and get it right but I'm fighting and I'm hoping,\" said Williams. \"What makes me happy is the effort.

Money raised will go to the Fondation pour l'Enfance (Foundation for Childhood) which aims to rebuild a children's shelter in Sri Lanka. Sir Elton played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his wife Anne-Aymone.

    "A Labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the Royal Family the same rights as males.\nThe legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the Crown. It would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. But the government refused to back Lord Dubs' Succession to the Crown Bill, saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues.\nThe Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, agreed the 1701 Act of Settlement, which governs the succession, was discriminatory but added that \"for all practical purposes its effects are limited\".\nThe changes proposed by Lord Dubs were a \"complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues\", he said. Lord Falconer said there were 22 members of the Royal Family in the line of succession after the Prince of Wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act. \"It is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. While we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn't the proper form,\" he added.\nHe did not rule out change in the future but said if Lord Dubs' private member's bill was passed by peers, he would urge MPs to oppose it in the Commons. Lord Dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the House of Lords, but urged the government to think again at a later stage. \"We cannot forever say we don't want to change things because it is too difficult,\" he told peers. During the debate, the Labour peer and former minister said: \"The monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. \"What we don't want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times. \"We are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against Catholics.\" But opponents of the bill, including Tory Lord Campbell of Alloway and the Bishop of Winchester, the Rt Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, said it would separate the state from both the Church of England and the Christian faith. Such a \"secular\" state would be markedly \"less tolerant\", Rt Rev Scott-Joynt argued.",
    "The UK' opposition Conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the General Election. Here's a guide to the plan:\nPeople coming to live and work in Britain from outside the EU. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of TB, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the European Union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.\nTuberculosis, Hepatitis B and HIV. A positive test for TB would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.\nPeople would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the UK, or impose significant costs or demands on the NHS. They would also, if appropriate, have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.\nPeople coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching. Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB. Under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and HIV.\nThe Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health. However, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.\nThey claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. They also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into Britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. They say the plans will protect access to the NHS.\nApplicants will be tested in their home country. Only asylum seekers will be tested in the UK once their refugee status is established.\nHome Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries. Recent medical checks were carried out on 175,000 people at Heathrow Airport and 10,000 at Gatwick. From those tests, about 100 infectious cases of TB were found.\nThe Tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. The party has looked at the way the system is operated in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Tory proposals are \"quite closely modelled\" on the New Zealand system.\nLabour claims the policy is little more than a \"desperate attempt to catch up with Labour's five-year plan\" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week. This says health screening for TB will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. The Liberal Democrats have warned Labour and the Tories they were \"in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it\".",
    "Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.\nLG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. The firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in January 2004, which gave control to the creditors. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card's plastic for purchases.\nLG Card's creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.\n\"Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,\" said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm's major creditors. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. It says it wants \"fair and reasonable guidelines\" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said. Analysts believe a compromise is likely. \"LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,\" said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.\nLG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. LG card's creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. \"Eventually, LG Group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,\" said Mr Kim.",
    "Plans to portray Dominica's Carib Indians as cannibals in the sequel to hit film Pirates of the Caribbean have been criticised by the group's chief.\nCarib Chief Charles Williams said talks with Disney's producers revealed there was \"a strong element of cannibalism in the script which cannot be removed\". The Caribbean island's government said Disney planned to film in Dominica. The Caribs have long denied their ancestors practised cannibalism. Disney was unavailable for comment. \"Our ancestors stood up against early European conquerors and because they stood up...we were labelled savages and cannibals up to today,\" said Mr Williams.\n\"This cannot be perpetuated in movies.\" Shooting on the sequel is expected to begin in April, with hundreds of Dominicans applying to be extras in the movie.\nAbout 3,000 Caribs live on the island of Dominica, which has a population of 70,000. Many Caribs were killed by disease and war during colonisation up to the 1600s. Mr Williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film. But he admitted there were some members of the Carib council who did not support the campaign. He said some did not \"understand our history, they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the Carib people\".

She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. At first, White claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions.\n\"My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product,\" White said in the LA Times. \"Whether it be a good product or a bad product, he was selling a product.\" White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case. The 27-year-old believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning. \"I have no clue what it's going to take to change that,\" said White. \"I would say I made a mistake and I would never, ever go back. \"I would never recommend anyone to take that route.\"",
    "Tony Blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on Monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 May.\nThe date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted. Over the weeks, there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day Mr Blair would go for an historic third term. And the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. The prime minister and his campaign boss Alan Milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between Labour's stability and investment against Tory cuts and boom and bust.\nAnd Chancellor Gordon Brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in Westminster - to underline that economic message. And it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.\nDuring the phoney campaign, Labour got into trouble over its central claim that Michael Howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. The prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the Tories compared to Labour's plans was a cut. And it looked like the Labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by Mr Howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. Then deputy Conservative Chairman Howard Flight was reported to have suggested Mr Howard was secretly planning even bigger \"cuts\".\nHe was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering Labour campaign was back on track. A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again. Mr Brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. As usual, the Liberal Democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. But leader Charles Kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. Other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum, the war on Iraq, law and order and education, for example. But, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. And, whatever that outcome, 2005 is set to be a far more lively, even bitter campaign than 2001's non-event.",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "Celtic's Neil Lennon admits Rangers could be considered \"slight favourites\" for the Old Firm CIS Cup clash, but insists his side can still win.\nLennon concedes Rangers are in good form at the moment, but they have failed to beat Celtic in their last seven meetings. \"Rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks,\" he said. \"But it's a game we believe we're capable of winning if we play our best,\" he told the Evening Times. \"All the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in. \"Without playing at the top of our game, we have still been winning matches. \"At the minute, we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in Europe, so I don't think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out. \"Of course, it is a concern when you are losing goals, because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets, but hopefully we are over that wee run. \"Considering we lost Henrik Larsson at the end of last season, we have still been scoring a lot of goals, which is pleasing.\"",
    "US retail giant Federated Department Stores is to buy rival May Department Stores for $11bn (£5.7bn).\nThe deal will bring together famous stores like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Field's, creating the largest department store chain in the US. The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn. The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May's chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January. As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's - will assume $6bn of May's debt, bringing the deal's total value to $17bn. Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.\nMay has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as Federated and other retailers such as Wal-Mart. Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.\n\"We have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in America, creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence,\" said Terry Lundgren, Federated's chairman. Some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for May. \"Without this deal May would have been, to put it bluntly, washed up,\" said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group. Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while May's yearly sales are $14.4bn.",
    "Juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O'Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic.\nBrian Hassell says no official approach has been received from Manchester City but that the English club had been earmarked as a possible destination. But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O'Neill's first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would \"desperately like to stay at Celtic\" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted.\nThe agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old's father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho's father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. \"I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn't want to go there,\" said Hassel. \"He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic.\" Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. \"It was a thought at one stage,\" he said. \"If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. \"He is a fan of Kevin Keegan's style of play. It would not be a bad move for him.\" Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: \"The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn't happened. \"If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. That would be good for the club and good for me. \"If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes.\" The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O'Neill since his move to Celtic Park. \"I can't understand why I am in this situation,\" he continued. \"When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support.\"",
    "Oscar-winner Andrea Arnold has been congratulated by the UK Film Council, the organisation which partly funded her project.\nArnold's film Wasp won the best live action short film award on Sunday. \"The UK Film Council spends millions of pounds of lottery investment on short filmmaking in Britain every year,\" said chief executive officer John Woodward. \"It certainly pays off when you see new film-makers winning such prestigious awards,\" he added.\nWasp, which was commissioned by the Film Council and Channel 4, beat films by fellow UK nominees Gary McKendry and Ashvin Kumar to the prize. It stars actress Nathalie Press, who appeared in the Bafta-winning drama My Summer Of Love, as a single mother who is forced to take drastic action when she is invited on a date and is unable to find a babysitter to look after her four daughters. The film has already won over 30 other international awards including the Sundance Short Film Prize. Arnold, from Dartford in Kent, described her victory as \"truly overwhelming. I'm really not used to this kind of thing,\" she said, after receiving her Oscar from actor Jeremy Irons. \"Thanks to everyone who worked on this - the beers are on me when we get home.\" The director was one of only two British winners on the night, the other being Sandy Powell, who won the costume design Oscar for her work on The Aviator.",
    "The last film to be made by the slain Dutch director Theo van Gogh, called 06/05, has been premiered in The Hague.\nMembers of Van Gogh's family and celebrities attended the screening of 06/05, based on the murder of the anti-immigration politician Pim Fortuyn. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in Amsterdam six weeks ago. A Dutch-Moroccan man suspected of radical Islamist links has been charged. The killing, and Fortuyn's death in 2002, convulsed the Netherlands. Many Dutch people have questioned their country's self-image as a peaceful, tolerant nation in the wake of the murders, which triggered heated debate about immigration.\nAn animal rights activist was sentenced to 18 years in prison last year for killing Fortuyn. Earlier this year, Van Gogh made a film accusing Islam of promoting violence against women. It caused outrage among Muslims and death threats were made against him. The film 06/05 will become available on the internet on Wednesday and go on general release in Dutch cinemas in January. Van Gogh's movie mixes real images of the day of Fortuyn's murder with a fictional plot about Dutch intelligence services conspiring to silence the politician. The story unfolds through the eyes of a freelance photographer who unwittingly takes pictures revealing the involvement of Dutch authorities in Fortuyn's murder. Photographer Jim de Booy then goes on the run from secret service agents who burgle his home and threaten his family.",
    "The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.\nThe Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn. The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn. The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.\nDemocrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.",
    "The world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.\nThe Wolong Nature Reserve in the Sichuan Province of southwest China is home to 20% of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world. A broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. The data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. The reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.\nUsing the network, vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs' chances of survival.\n\"Digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside Wolong and with the rest of the world,\" said Zhang Hemin, director of the Wolong Nature Reserve. \"Our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings.\" The network has been developed by Intel, working closely with the staff at Wolong. It includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.\nBefore the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park, staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. Infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. To foster cultural links across the globe, a children's learning lab has been incorporated in the network, in collaboration with Globio (Federation for Global Biodiversity Education for Children), an international non-profit organisation. It will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in Portland, Oregon in the US. \"Digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world,\" said Globio founder Gerry Ellis.",
    "The shape of the UK's economy In graphics\nBut he denied that he was ruling out British membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year. Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future. Otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of China, he told MPs.\nThe chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.\nUnder Mr Brown's rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit. He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rules \"make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure\". But he argued that the EU was moving in the direction of the UK principles, and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year, to include investment, and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year. Under Mr Brown's \"sustainable investment\" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.\nMr Brown vigorously denied Conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. In March the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassified £3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only £6bn. Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter. But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was \"impugning the integrity\" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. Mr Brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap. He told the Treasury Select Committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost Treasury coffers.\nEarlier, ex-Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more \"rigid\" rules. But fellow Tory David Heathcoat-Amory said the folly of the system was in trying to run Europe's varied economies on one set of rules. \"The essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake,\" he said. \"The warning is about the European constitution, which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two, and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. It gives more powers to Brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy.\" But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. \"The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,\" Mr. Brown said.",
    "A call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and Asian MPs has been rejected by one of Labour's most senior Asians.\nShahid Malik, who is on Labour's ruling NEC, accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. Just 13 of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists. That came after it emerged that one of Britain's most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.\nMr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. \"If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,\" he said. He added: \"It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didn't have a minority candidate.\" Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.\nBut he argued: \"I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren't doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective.\" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as \"painful\". \"I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasn't worked,\" she said. \"The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people.\" On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was \"ambitious\" to improve black and Asian representation. \"We haven't ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this,\" he said.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "The stage adaptation of children's film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in London's West End.\nSir Cameron Mackintosh's lavish production, which has cost £9m to bring to the stage, was given a 10-minute standing ovation. Lead actress Laura Michelle Kelly soared over the heads of the audience holding the nanny's trademark umbrella. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins' flight into the auditorium during preview performances. A number of celebrities turned out for the musical's premiere, including actress Barbara Windsor, comic Graham Norton and Sir Richard Attenborough.\nThe show's director Richard Eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney's 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.",
    "A British author has had the film rights to her children's bestseller snapped up for a seven-figure sum, with Ridley Scott set to direct.\nMichelle Paver's Wolf Brother, a fantasy set 6,000 years ago, is the first in a planned series of six books. Film studio Fox has bought the rights for around $4m (£2.13m) for Scott's company Scott Free to develop. The director said he was \"thrilled\" with the project. \"Wolf Brother is an enchanting book,\" he said. Paver, who lives in London and previously worked as a lawyer, began writing the book in 1982 while studying biochemistry at Oxford University.\nShe was an established author of love stories when she turned the work-in-progress into a children's novel. It was published in 2004, with Paver earning an advance of $5m (£2.8m) - the highest sum ever paid for a debut children's book. Wolf Brother tells the story of Torak, a 12-year-old hunter who lives in the forest. After his father is killed he teams up with a wolf cub and sets out to rid the forest of an evil force. Paver is currently writing the second book in the series. \"Michelle Paver lives and breathes the worlds she writes about,\" said a spokesman for the author. \"I've told her about the film deal but at the moment she is writing the second book and her mind is 6000 years away deep in the primeval forest.\"",
    "The US dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on Friday as concern grows about the size of the US budget deficit.\nAnalysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. The Bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. However, trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. This has amplified reactions to news, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in January.\nThe dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on Friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on Thursday. One dollar bought 102.55 yen.\nDisappointing business figures from Chicago triggered the US currency's weakness on Thursday. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2, a bigger fall than expected. \"There are no dollar buyers now, especially after the Chicago data yesterday,\" said ABN Amro's Paul Mackel. At the same time, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was \"absolutely worrying\" for Italian exports. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. Investors will now look towards February's meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised nations in London for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar's decline.",
    "The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US.\nNew Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (£130,000) fine.\nIn a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 \"sound recordings\" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting \"criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks\". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April.",

Get Me Out of Here drew an average of 10.9m viewers - about four million fewer than the previous series.\nThe fourth series of the show peaked on Monday at 11.9m and 49.2% of the audience, just before Joe Pasquale won. This compared with a peak of 15.3m at and a record 62.2% of the TV audience when Kerry McFadden won in February. Comic Pasquale beat former Royal butler Paul Burrell who came second, nightclub owner Fran Cosgrave, who was third. Pasquale follows Kerry McFadden, Phil Tufnell and Tony Blackburn as winners of the show.\nSinger and TV presenter McFadden was the show's first female winner. When cricketer Phil Tufnell won in May 2003, 12.3 million people - 50% of the viewing public - tuned in to watch. And when Tony Blackburn won the first show in 2002, 10.9 million people saw the show. Pasquale had been the show's hottest ever favourite to win, and its hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, known as Ant and Dec, said Monday's deciding vote was the closest in the programme's history.\nPascuale has been flooded with offers of TV work, according to his management company, but one of his first jobs on his return is pantomime.\nBefore joining I'm a Celebrity, he had signed up to play Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk in Birmingham, and tickets for the show have become increasingly popular since he joined the TV show.

The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.",
    "An Iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries.\nArash Sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. Mr Sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area. His sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, comes a day after an online \"day of action\" to secure his release. Iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs, restricting access to major blogging sites from within Iran. A second Iranian blogger, Motjaba Saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests, is still being held.\nA spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi's sentence as \"harsh\" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. \"The authorities are trying to make an example of him,\" the organisation said in a statement.\n\"By handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger, their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media.\" In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the BBC Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda. Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. They accused Mr Sigarchi of a string of crimes against Iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of Iran's Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr Sigarchi's lawyer labelled the revolutionary court \"illegal and incompetent\" and called for a retrial in a public court.\nMr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world.\nThe Committee to Protect Bloggers designated 22 February 2005 as Free Mojtaba and Arash Day. Around 10,000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. About 12% of users were based in Iran, the campaign's director told the BBC News website. Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. \"The eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on Iran since Sigarchi's sentence, not less. \"The mullahs won't be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere.\"",
    "Newcastle manager Graeme Souness is closing in on signing Chelsea defender Celestine Babayaro when the transfer window reopens.\nSouness is bidding to bolster his defence and, according to reports, contract negotiations are at an advanced stage with the player. Babayaro has been in the Premiership since 1997 when he moved to Chelsea for £2.25m from Anderlecht. But the 26-year-old has been surplus to requirements this season. Souness would not be drawn on specifics over individual players.\nBut he said: \"All I can tell you is that the chairman has worked really hard in the last couple of months to try to do deals. \"We have said from day one we want to strengthen, and that is what we are hoping to do in the coming weeks.\"",
    "In a sign of a thaw in relations between Egypt and Israel, the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the US, allowing Egyptian goods made in partnership with Israeli firms free access to American markets.\nThe protocol, signed in Cairo, will establish what are called \"qualified industrial zones\" in Egypt. Products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the US, provided that 35% of their components are the product of Israeli-Egyptian cooperation. The US describes this as the most important economic agreement between Egypt and Israel in two decades.\nThe protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years. There has been deep sensitivity in Egypt about any form of co-operation with Israel as long as its peace process with the Palestinians remains blocked. But in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. Both exchanged prisoners earlier this month, with Egypt handing back an Israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.\nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak has described Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as the best chance for the Palestinians to achieve peace. The government in Cairo now believes Mr Sharon is moving towards the centre and away from the positions of right wing groups. It also believes the US, pressed by Europe, is now more willing to engage seriously in the search for a settlement. But there are also pressing economic reasons for Egypt's decision to enter into the trade agreement. It will give a huge boost to Egyptian textile exports, which are about to suffer a drop after new regulations come into force in the US at the beginning of the year.",
    "Life insurer Axa Sun Life has lowered annual bonus payouts for up to 50,000 with-profits investors.\nRegular annual bonus rates on former Axa Equity & Law with-profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004. Axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002. The cut will hit an estimated 3% of Axa's policyholders. The rest will know their fate in March.\nThe cuts on Axa's policies will mean a policyholder who had invested £50 a month into an endowment policy for the past 25 years would see a final maturity payout of £46,998. This equated to a annual investment growth rate of 8% Axa said. With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. However, heavy stock market falls throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. \"The stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002,\" Axa spokesman Mark Hamilton, Axa spokesman, told BBC News. Axa cut payouts for the same investors last January.",

Awake,\nMy fairest, my espoused, my latest found,\nHeaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!\nAwake:  The morning shines, and the fresh field\nCalls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring\nOur tender plants, how blows the citron grove,\nWhat drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,\nHow nature paints her colours, how the bee\nSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.\nSuch whispering waked her, but with startled eye\nOn Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.\nO sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,\nMy glory, my perfection! glad I see\nThy face, and morn returned; for I this night\n(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,\nIf dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,\nWorks of day past, or morrow's next design,\nBut of offence and trouble, which my mind\nKnew never till this irksome night:  Methought,\nClose at mine ear one called me forth to walk\nWith gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said,\n'Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,\n'The cool, the silent, save where silence yields\n'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake\n'Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns\n'Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light\n'Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,\n'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,\n'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?\n'In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment\n'Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.'\nI rose as at thy call, but found thee not;\nTo find thee I directed then my walk;\nAnd on, methought, alone I passed through ways\nThat brought me on a sudden to the tree\nOf interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,\nMuch fairer to my fancy than by day:\nAnd, as I wondering looked, beside it stood\nOne shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven\nBy us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled\nAmbrosia; on that tree he also gazed;\nAnd 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged,\n'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,\n'Nor God, nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised?\n'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?\n'Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold\n'Longer thy offered good; why else set here?\nThis said, he paused not, but with venturous arm\nHe plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled\nAt such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:\nBut he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine,\n'Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,\n'Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit\n'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:\n'And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more\n'Communicated, more abundant grows,\n'The author not impaired, but honoured more?\n'Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!\n'Partake thou also; happy though thou art,\n'Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:\n'Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods\n'Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,\n'But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes\n'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see\n'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!'\nSo saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,\nEven to my mouth of that same fruit held part\nWhich he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell\nSo quickened appetite, that I, methought,\nCould not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds\nWith him I flew, and underneath beheld\nThe earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide\nAnd various:  Wondering at my flight and change\nTo this high exaltation; suddenly\nMy guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,\nAnd fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked\nTo find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night\nRelated, and thus Adam answered sad.\nBest image of myself, and dearer half,\nThe trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep\nAffects me equally; nor can I like\nThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;\nYet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,\nCreated pure.  But know that in the soul\nAre many lesser faculties, that serve\nReason as chief; among these Fancy next\nHer office holds; of all external things\nWhich the five watchful senses represent,\nShe forms imaginations, aery shapes,\nWhich Reason, joining or disjoining, frames\nAll what we affirm or what deny, and call\nOur knowledge or opinion; then retires\nInto her private cell, when nature rests.\nOft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes\nTo imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,\nWild work produces oft, and most in dreams;\nIll matching words and deeds long past or late.\nSome such resemblances, methinks, I find\nOf our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,\nBut with addition strange; yet be not sad.\nEvil into the mind of God or Man\nMay come and go, so unreproved, and leave\nNo spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope\nThat what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,\nWaking thou never will consent to do.\nBe not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,\nThat wont to be more cheerful and serene,\nThan when fair morning first smiles on the world;\nAnd let us to our fresh employments rise\nAmong the groves, the fountains, and the flowers\nThat open now their choisest bosomed smells,\nReserved from night, and kept for thee in store.\nSo cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;\nBut silently a gentle tear let fall\nFrom either eye, and wiped them with her hair;\nTwo other precious drops that ready stood,\nEach in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell\nKissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse\nAnd pious awe, that feared to have offended.\nSo all was cleared, and to the field they haste.\nBut first, from under shady arborous roof\nSoon as they forth were come to open sight\nOf day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,\nWith wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,\nShot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,\nDiscovering in wide landskip all the east\nOf Paradise and Eden's happy plains,\nLowly they bowed adoring, and began\nTheir orisons, each morning duly paid\nIn various style; for neither various style\nNor holy rapture wanted they to praise\nTheir Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung\nUnmeditated; such prompt eloquence\nFlowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,\nMore tuneable than needed lute or harp\nTo add more sweetness; and they thus began.\nThese are thy glorious works, Parent of good,\nAlmighty!  Thine this universal frame,\nThus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then!\nUnspeakable, who sitst above these heavens\nTo us invisible, or dimly seen\nIn these thy lowest works; yet these declare\nThy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.\nSpeak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,\nAngels; for ye behold him, and with songs\nAnd choral symphonies, day without night,\nCircle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven\nOn Earth join all ye Creatures to extol\nHim first, him last, him midst, and without end.\nFairest of stars, last in the train of night,\nIf better thou belong not to the dawn,\nSure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn\nWith thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,\nWhile day arises, that sweet hour of prime.\nThou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,\nAcknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise\nIn thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,\nAnd when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.\nMoon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,\nWith the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;\nAnd ye five other wandering Fires, that move\nIn mystick dance not without song, resound\nHis praise, who out of darkness called up light.\nAir, and ye Elements, the eldest birth\nOf Nature's womb, that in quaternion run\nPerpetual circle, multiform; and mix\nAnd nourish all things; let your ceaseless change\nVary to our great Maker still new praise.\nYe Mists and Exhalations, that now rise\nFrom hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,\nTill the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,\nIn honour to the world's great Author rise;\nWhether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,\nOr wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,\nRising or falling still advance his praise.\nHis praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,\nBreathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,\nWith every plant, in sign of worship wave.\nFountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,\nMelodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.\nJoin voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds,\nThat singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,\nBear on your wings and in your notes his praise.\nYe that in waters glide, and ye that walk\nThe earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;\nWitness if I be silent, morn or even,\nTo hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,\nMade vocal by my song, and taught his praise.\nHail, universal Lord, be bounteous still\nTo give us only good; and if the night\nHave gathered aught of evil, or concealed,\nDisperse it, as now light dispels the dark!\nSo prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts\nFirm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.\nOn to their morning's rural work they haste,\nAmong sweet dews and flowers; where any row\nOf fruit-trees over-woody reached too far\nTheir pampered boughs, and needed hands to check\nFruitless embraces: or they led the vine\nTo wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines\nHer marriageable arms, and with him brings\nHer dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn\nHis barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld\nWith pity Heaven's high King, and to him called\nRaphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned\nTo travel with Tobias, and secured\nHis marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.\nRaphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth\nSatan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,\nHath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed\nThis night the human pair; how he designs\nIn them at once to ruin all mankind.\nGo therefore, half this day as friend with friend\nConverse with Adam, in what bower or shade\nThou findest him from the heat of noon retired,\nTo respite his day-labour with repast,\nOr with repose; and such discourse bring on,\nAs may advise him of his happy state,\nHappiness in his power left free to will,\nLeft to his own free will, his will though free,\nYet mutable; whence warn him to beware\nHe swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal\nHis danger, and from whom; what enemy,\nLate fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now\nThe fall of others from like state of bliss;\nBy violence? no, for that shall be withstood;\nBut by deceit and lies:  This let him know,\nLest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend\nSurprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.\nSo spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled\nAll justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint\nAfter his charge received; but from among\nThousand celestial Ardours, where he stood\nVeiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,\nFlew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,\nOn each hand parting, to his speed gave way\nThrough all the empyreal road; till, at the gate\nOf Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide\nOn golden hinges turning, as by work\nDivine the sovran Architect had framed.\nFrom hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,\nStar interposed, however small he sees,\nNot unconformed to other shining globes,\nEarth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned\nAbove all hills.  As when by night the glass\nOf Galileo, less assured, observes\nImagined lands and regions in the moon:\nOr pilot, from amidst the Cyclades\nDelos or Samos first appearing, kens\nA cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight\nHe speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky\nSails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing\nNow on the polar winds, then with quick fan\nWinnows the buxom air; till, within soar\nOf towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems\nA phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,\nWhen, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's\nBright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.\nAt once on the eastern cliff of Paradise\nHe lights, and to his proper shape returns\nA Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade\nHis lineaments divine; the pair that clad\nEach shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast\nWith regal ornament; the middle pair\nGirt like a starry zone his waist, and round\nSkirted his loins and thighs with downy gold\nAnd colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet\nShadowed from either heel with feathered mail,\nSky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood,\nAnd shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled\nThe circuit wide.  Straight knew him all the bands\nOf Angels under watch; and to his state,\nAnd to his message high, in honour rise;\nFor on some message high they guessed him bound.\nTheir glittering tents he passed, and now is come\nInto the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,\nAnd flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;\nA wilderness of sweets; for Nature here\nWantoned as in her prime, and played at will\nHer virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,\nWild above rule or art, enormous bliss.\nHim through the spicy forest onward come\nAdam discerned, as in the door he sat\nOf his cool bower, while now the mounted sun\nShot down direct his fervid rays to warm\nEarth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:\nAnd Eve within, due at her hour prepared\nFor dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please\nTrue appetite, and not disrelish thirst\nOf nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,\nBerry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called.\nHaste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold\nEastward among those trees, what glorious shape\nComes this way moving; seems another morn\nRisen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven\nTo us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe\nThis day to be our guest.  But go with speed,\nAnd, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour\nAbundance, fit to honour and receive\nOur heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford\nOur givers their own gifts, and large bestow\nFrom large bestowed, where Nature multiplies\nHer fertile growth, and by disburthening grows\nMore fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.\nTo whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould,\nOf God inspired! small store will serve, where store,\nAll seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;\nSave what by frugal storing firmness gains\nTo nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:\nBut I will haste, and from each bough and brake,\nEach plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice\nTo entertain our Angel-guest, as he\nBeholding shall confess, that here on Earth\nGod hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.\nSo saying, with dispatchful looks in haste\nShe turns, on hospitable thoughts intent\nWhat choice to choose for delicacy best,\nWhat order, so contrived as not to mix\nTastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring\nTaste after taste upheld with kindliest change;\nBestirs her then, and from each tender stalk\nWhatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields\nIn India East or West, or middle shore\nIn Pontus or the Punick coast, or where\nAlcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat\nRough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,\nShe gathers, tribute large, and on the board\nHeaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape\nShe crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths\nFrom many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed\nShe tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold\nWants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground\nWith rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.\nMean while our primitive great sire, to meet\nHis God-like guest, walks forth, without more train\nAccompanied than with his own complete\nPerfections; in himself was all his state,\nMore solemn than the tedious pomp that waits\nOn princes, when their rich retinue long\nOf horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,\nDazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.\nNearer his presence Adam, though not awed,\nYet with submiss approach and reverence meek,\nAs to a superiour nature bowing low,\nThus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place\nNone can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;\nSince, by descending from the thrones above,\nThose happy places thou hast deigned a while\nTo want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us\nTwo only, who yet by sovran gift possess\nThis spacious ground, in yonder shady bower\nTo rest; and what the garden choicest bears\nTo sit and taste, till this meridian heat\nBe over, and the sun more cool decline.\nWhom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.\nAdam, I therefore came; nor art thou such\nCreated, or such place hast here to dwell,\nAs may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,\nTo visit thee; lead on then where thy bower\nO'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,\nI have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge\nThey came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,\nWith flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,\nUndecked save with herself, more lovely fair\nThan Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned\nOf three that in mount Ida naked strove,\nStood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil\nShe needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm\nAltered her cheek.  On whom the Angel Hail\nBestowed, the holy salutation used\nLong after to blest Mary, second Eve.\nHail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb\nShall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,\nThan with these various fruits the trees of God\nHave heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf\nTheir table was, and mossy seats had round,\nAnd on her ample square from side to side\nAll autumn piled, though spring and autumn here\nDanced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;\nNo fear lest dinner cool; when thus began\nOur author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste\nThese bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom\nAll perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,\nTo us for food and for delight hath caused\nThe earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps\nTo spiritual natures; only this I know,\nThat one celestial Father gives to all.\nTo whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives\n(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part\nSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be found\nNo ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure\nIntelligential substances require,\nAs doth your rational; and both contain\nWithin them every lower faculty\nOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,\nTasting concoct, digest, assimilate,\nAnd corporeal to incorporeal turn.\nFor know, whatever was created, needs\nTo be sustained and fed:  Of elements\nThe grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,\nEarth and the sea feed air, the air those fires\nEthereal, and as lowest first the moon;\nWhence in her visage round those spots, unpurged\nVapours not yet into her substance turned.\nNor doth the moon no nourishment exhale\nFrom her moist continent to higher orbs.\nThe sun that light imparts to all, receives\nFrom all his alimental recompence\nIn humid exhalations, and at even\nSups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees\nOf life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines\nYield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn\nWe brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground\nCovered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here\nVaried his bounty so with new delights,\nAs may compare with Heaven; and to taste\nThink not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,\nAnd to their viands fell; nor seemingly\nThe Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss\nOf Theologians; but with keen dispatch\nOf real hunger, and concoctive heat\nTo transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires\nThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire\nOf sooty coal the empirick alchemist\nCan turn, or holds it possible to turn,\nMetals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,\nAs from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve\nMinistered naked, and their flowing cups\nWith pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence\nDeserving Paradise! if ever, then,\nThen had the sons of God excuse to have been\nEnamoured at that sight; but in those hearts\nLove unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy\nWas understood, the injured lover's hell.\nThus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,\nNot burdened nature, sudden mind arose\nIn Adam, not to let the occasion pass\nGiven him by this great conference to know\nOf things above his world, and of their being\nWho dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw\nTranscend his own so far; whose radiant forms,\nDivine effulgence, whose high power, so far\nExceeded human; and his wary speech\nThus to the empyreal minister he framed.\nInhabitant with God, now know I well\nThy favour, in this honour done to Man;\nUnder whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed\nTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,\nFood not of Angels, yet accepted so,\nAs that more willingly thou couldst not seem\nAt Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare\nTo whom the winged Hierarch replied.\nO Adam, One Almighty is, from whom\nAll things proceed, and up to him return,\nIf not depraved from good, created all\nSuch to perfection, one first matter all,\nEndued with various forms, various degrees\nOf substance, and, in things that live, of life;\nBut more refined, more spiritous, and pure,\nAs nearer to him placed, or nearer tending\nEach in their several active spheres assigned,\nTill body up to spirit work, in bounds\nProportioned to each kind.  So from the root\nSprings lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves\nMore aery, last the bright consummate flower\nSpirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,\nMan's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,\nTo vital spirits aspire, to animal,\nTo intellectual; give both life and sense,\nFancy and understanding; whence the soul\nReason receives, and reason is her being,\nDiscursive, or intuitive; discourse\nIs oftest yours, the latter most is ours,\nDiffering but in degree, of kind the same.\nWonder not then, what God for you saw good\nIf I refuse not, but convert, as you\nTo proper substance.  Time may come, when Men\nWith Angels may participate, and find\nNo inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;\nAnd from these corporal nutriments perhaps\nYour bodies may at last turn all to spirit,\nImproved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend\nEthereal, as we; or may, at choice,\nHere or in heavenly Paradises dwell;\nIf ye be found obedient, and retain\nUnalterably firm his love entire,\nWhose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy\nYour fill what happiness this happy state\nCan comprehend, incapable of more.\nTo whom the patriarch of mankind replied.\nO favourable Spirit, propitious guest,\nWell hast thou taught the way that might direct\nOur knowledge, and the scale of nature set\nFrom center to circumference; whereon,\nIn contemplation of created things,\nBy steps we may ascend to God.  But say,\nWhat meant that caution joined, If ye be found\nObedient?  Can we want obedience then\nTo him, or possibly his love desert,\nWho formed us from the dust and placed us here\nFull to the utmost measure of what bliss\nHuman desires can seek or apprehend?\nTo whom the Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth,\nAttend!  That thou art happy, owe to God;\nThat thou continuest such, owe to thyself,\nThat is, to thy obedience; therein stand.\nThis was that caution given thee; be advised.\nGod made thee perfect, not immutable;\nAnd good he made thee, but to persevere\nHe left it in thy power; ordained thy will\nBy nature free, not over-ruled by fate\nInextricable, or strict necessity:\nOur voluntary service he requires,\nNot our necessitated; such with him\nFinds no acceptance, nor can find; for how\nCan hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve\nWilling or no, who will but what they must\nBy destiny, and can no other choose?\nMyself, and all the angelick host, that stand\nIn sight of God, enthroned, our happy state\nHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;\nOn other surety none:  Freely we serve,\nBecause we freely love, as in our will\nTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:\nAnd some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,\nAnd so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall\nFrom what high state of bliss, into what woe!\nTo whom our great progenitor.  Thy words\nAttentive, and with more delighted ear,\nDivine instructer, I have heard, than when\nCherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills\nAereal musick send:  Nor knew I not\nTo be both will and deed created free;\nYet that we never shall forget to love\nOur Maker, and obey him whose command\nSingle is yet so just, my constant thoughts\nAssured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest\nHath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,\nBut more desire to hear, if thou consent,\nThe full relation, which must needs be strange,\nWorthy of sacred silence to be heard;\nAnd we have yet large day, for scarce the sun\nHath finished half his journey, and scarce begins\nHis other half in the great zone of Heaven.\nThus Adam made request; and Raphael,\nAfter short pause assenting, thus began.\nHigh matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,\nSad task and hard:  For how shall I relate\nTo human sense the invisible exploits\nOf warring Spirits? how, without remorse,\nThe ruin of so many glorious once\nAnd perfect while they stood? how last unfold\nThe secrets of another world, perhaps\nNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy good\nThis is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach\nOf human sense, I shall delineate so,\nBy likening spiritual to corporal forms,\nAs may express them best; though what if Earth\nBe but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein\nEach to other like, more than on earth is thought?\nAs yet this world was not, and Chaos wild\nReigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests\nUpon her center poised; when on a day\n(For time, though in eternity, applied\nTo motion, measures all things durable\nBy present, past, and future,) on such day\nAs Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host\nOf Angels by imperial summons called,\nInnumerable before the Almighty's throne\nForthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared\nUnder their Hierarchs in orders bright:\nTen thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,\nStandards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear\nStream in the air, and for distinction serve\nOf hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;\nOr in their glittering tissues bear imblazed\nHoly memorials, acts of zeal and love\nRecorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs\nOf circuit inexpressible they stood,\nOrb within orb, the Father Infinite,\nBy whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,\nAmidst as from a flaming mount, whose top\nBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.\nHear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nHear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.\nThis day I have begot whom I declare\nMy only Son, and on this holy hill\nHim have anointed, whom ye now behold\nAt my right hand; your head I him appoint;\nAnd by myself have sworn, to him shall bow\nAll knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:\nUnder his great vice-gerent reign abide\nUnited, as one individual soul,\nFor ever happy:  Him who disobeys,\nMe disobeys, breaks union, and that day,\nCast out from God and blessed vision, falls\nInto utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place\nOrdained without redemption, without end.\nSo spake the Omnipotent, and with his words\nAll seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.\nThat day, as other solemn days, they spent\nIn song and dance about the sacred hill;\nMystical dance, which yonder starry sphere\nOf planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels\nResembles nearest, mazes intricate,\nEccentrick, intervolved, yet regular\nThen most, when most irregular they seem;\nAnd in their motions harmony divine\nSo smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear\nListens delighted.  Evening now approached,\n(For we have also our evening and our morn,\nWe ours for change delectable, not need;)\nForthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn\nDesirous; all in circles as they stood,\nTables are set, and on a sudden piled\nWith Angels food, and rubied nectar flows\nIn pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,\nFruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.\nOn flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,\nThey eat, they drink, and in communion sweet\nQuaff immortality and joy, secure\nOf surfeit, where full measure only bounds\nExcess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered\nWith copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.\nNow when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled\nFrom that high mount of God, whence light and shade\nSpring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed\nTo grateful twilight, (for night comes not there\nIn darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed\nAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;\nWide over all the plain, and wider far\nThan all this globous earth in plain outspread,\n(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,\nDispersed in bands and files, their camp extend\nBy living streams among the trees of life,\nPavilions numberless, and sudden reared,\nCelestial tabernacles, where they slept\nFanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,\nMelodious hymns about the sovran throne\nAlternate all night long: but not so waked\nSatan; so call him now, his former name\nIs heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,\nIf not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,\nIn favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught\nWith envy against the Son of God, that day\nHonoured by his great Father, and proclaimed\nMessiah King anointed, could not bear\nThrough pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.\nDeep malice thence conceiving and disdain,\nSoon as midnight brought on the dusky hour\nFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved\nWith all his legions to dislodge, and leave\nUnworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,\nContemptuous; and his next subordinate\nAwakening, thus to him in secret spake.\nSleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close\nThy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree\nOf yesterday, so late hath passed the lips\nOf Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy thoughts\nWast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;\nBoth waking we were one; how then can now\nThy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed;\nNew laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise\nIn us who serve, new counsels to debate\nWhat doubtful may ensue:  More in this place\nTo utter is not safe.  Assemble thou\nOf all those myriads which we lead the chief;\nTell them, that by command, ere yet dim night\nHer shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,\nAnd all who under me their banners wave,\nHomeward, with flying march, where we possess\nThe quarters of the north; there to prepare\nFit entertainment to receive our King,\nThe great Messiah, and his new commands,\nWho speedily through all the hierarchies\nIntends to pass triumphant, and give laws.\nSo spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused\nBad influence into the unwary breast\nOf his associate:  He together calls,\nOr several one by one, the regent Powers,\nUnder him Regent; tells, as he was taught,\nThat the Most High commanding, now ere night,\nNow ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,\nThe great hierarchal standard was to move;\nTells the suggested cause, and casts between\nAmbiguous words and jealousies, to sound\nOr taint integrity:  But all obeyed\nThe wonted signal, and superiour voice\nOf their great Potentate; for great indeed\nHis name, and high was his degree in Heaven;\nHis countenance, as the morning-star that guides\nThe starry flock, allured them, and with lies\nDrew after him the third part of Heaven's host.\nMean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns\nAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,\nAnd from within the golden lamps that burn\nNightly before him, saw without their light\nRebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread\nAmong the sons of morn, what multitudes\nWere banded to oppose his high decree;\nAnd, smiling, to his only Son thus said.\nSon, thou in whom my glory I behold\nIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might,\nNearly it now concerns us to be sure\nOf our Omnipotence, and with what arms\nWe mean to hold what anciently we claim\nOf deity or empire:  Such a foe\nIs rising, who intends to erect his throne\nEqual to ours, throughout the spacious north;\nNor so content, hath in his thought to try\nIn battle, what our power is, or our right.\nLet us advise, and to this hazard draw\nWith speed what force is left, and all employ\nIn our defence; lest unawares we lose\nThis our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.\nTo whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,\nLightning divine, ineffable, serene,\nMade answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes\nJustly hast in derision, and, secure,\nLaughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,\nMatter to me of glory, whom their hate\nIllustrates, when they see all regal power\nGiven me to quell their pride, and in event\nKnow whether I be dextrous to subdue\nThy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.\nSo spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,\nFar was advanced on winged speed; an host\nInnumerable as the stars of night,\nOr stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun\nImpearls on every leaf and every flower.\nRegions they passed, the mighty regencies\nOf Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,\nIn their triple degrees; regions to which\nAll thy dominion, Adam, is no more\nThan what this garden is to all the earth,\nAnd all the sea, from one entire globose\nStretched into longitude; which having passed,\nAt length into the limits of the north\nThey came; and Satan to his royal seat\nHigh on a hill, far blazing, as a mount\nRaised on a mount, with pyramids and towers\nFrom diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;\nThe palace of great Lucifer, (so call\nThat structure in the dialect of men\nInterpreted,) which not long after, he\nAffecting all equality with God,\nIn imitation of that mount whereon\nMessiah was declared in sight of Heaven,\nThe Mountain of the Congregation called;\nFor thither he assembled all his train,\nPretending so commanded to consult\nAbout the great reception of their King,\nThither to come, and with calumnious art\nOf counterfeited truth thus held their ears.\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nIf these magnifick titles yet remain\nNot merely titular, since by decree\nAnother now hath to himself engrossed\nAll power, and us eclipsed under the name\nOf King anointed, for whom all this haste\nOf midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,\nThis only to consult how we may best,\nWith what may be devised of honours new,\nReceive him coming to receive from us\nKnee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!\nToo much to one! but double how endured,\nTo one, and to his image now proclaimed?\nBut what if better counsels might erect\nOur minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?\nWill ye submit your necks, and choose to bend\nThe supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust\nTo know ye right, or if ye know yourselves\nNatives and sons of Heaven possessed before\nBy none; and if not equal all, yet free,\nEqually free; for orders and degrees\nJar not with liberty, but well consist.\nWho can in reason then, or right, assume\nMonarchy over such as live by right\nHis equals, if in power and splendour less,\nIn freedom equal? or can introduce\nLaw and edict on us, who without law\nErr not? much less for this to be our Lord,\nAnd look for adoration, to the abuse\nOf those imperial titles, which assert\nOur being ordained to govern, not to serve.\nThus far his bold discourse without controul\nHad audience; when among the Seraphim\nAbdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored\nThe Deity, and divine commands obeyed,\nStood up, and in a flame of zeal severe\nThe current of his fury thus opposed.\nO argument blasphemous, false, and proud!\nWords which no ear ever to hear in Heaven\nExpected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate,\nIn place thyself so high above thy peers.\nCanst thou with impious obloquy condemn\nThe just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,\nThat to his only Son, by right endued\nWith regal scepter, every soul in Heaven\nShall bend the knee, and in that honour due\nConfess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,\nFlatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,\nAnd equal over equals to let reign,\nOne over all with unsucceeded power.\nShalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute\nWith him the points of liberty, who made\nThee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven\nSuch as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?\nYet, by experience taught, we know how good,\nAnd of our good and of our dignity\nHow provident he is; how far from thought\nTo make us less, bent rather to exalt\nOur happy state, under one head more near\nUnited.  But to grant it thee unjust,\nThat equal over equals monarch reign:\nThyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,\nOr all angelick nature joined in one,\nEqual to him begotten Son? by whom,\nAs by his Word, the Mighty Father made\nAll things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven\nBy him created in their bright degrees,\nCrowned them with glory, and to their glory named\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,\nEssential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,\nBut more illustrious made; since he the head\nOne of our number thus reduced becomes;\nHis laws our laws; all honour to him done\nReturns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,\nAnd tempt not these; but hasten to appease\nThe incensed Father, and the incensed Son,\nWhile pardon may be found in time besought.\nSo spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal\nNone seconded, as out of season judged,\nOr singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced\nThe Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.\nThat we were formed then sayest thou? and the work\nOf secondary hands, by task transferred\nFrom Father to his Son? strange point and new!\nDoctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw\nWhen this creation was? rememberest thou\nThy making, while the Maker gave thee being?\nWe know no time when we were not as now;\nKnow none before us, self-begot, self-raised\nBy our own quickening power, when fatal course\nHad circled his full orb, the birth mature\nOf this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.\nOur puissance is our own; our own right hand\nShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try\nWho is our equal:  Then thou shalt behold\nWhether by supplication we intend\nAddress, and to begirt the almighty throne\nBeseeching or besieging.  This report,\nThese tidings carry to the anointed King;\nAnd fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.\nHe said; and, as the sound of waters deep,\nHoarse murmur echoed to his words applause\nThrough the infinite host; nor less for that\nThe flaming Seraph fearless, though alone\nEncompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.\nO alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,\nForsaken of all good!  I see thy fall\nDetermined, and thy hapless crew involved\nIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spread\nBoth of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth\nNo more be troubled how to quit the yoke\nOf God's Messiah; those indulgent laws\nWill not be now vouchsafed; other decrees\nAgainst thee are gone forth without recall;\nThat golden scepter, which thou didst reject,\nIs now an iron rod to bruise and break\nThy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise;\nYet not for thy advice or threats I fly\nThese wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath\nImpendent, raging into sudden flame,\nDistinguish not:  For soon expect to feel\nHis thunder on thy head, devouring fire.\nThen who created thee lamenting learn,\nWhen who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.\nSo spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found\nAmong the faithless, faithful only he;\nAmong innumerable false, unmoved,\nUnshaken, unseduced, unterrified,\nHis loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;\nNor number, nor example, with him wrought\nTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,\nThough single.  From amidst them forth he passed,\nLong way through hostile scorn, which he sustained\nSuperiour, nor of violence feared aught;\nAnd, with retorted scorn, his back he turned\nOn those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.",

In a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat butter, oil, and both sugars until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla until it is combined. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Mix to combine. Gently stir in the peeled, shredded apples. Generously grease and flour a standard size bundt cake pan. Transfer the batter to the bundt pan and use a spatula to gently even out the top. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes before flipping the cake to remove the cake from the pan. Completely cool the cake on a wire rack. You can freeze the cake before icing by wrapping the cooled cake tightly in plastic wrap. For the maple glaze: Sift the icing sugar into a small bowl. This will prevent any lumps in your icing. Add the milk and maple extract. Mix well to combine. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake.",

In a microwave-safe bowl, combine butter, milk and water. Heat for 2 minutes. Test with your finger; if the mixture is too hot to the touch, it will be too hot for your yeast. Add liquid ingredients to the dry mixture. Mix. Now add the eggs and mix well. Add 6 cups of flour. This will give you a very sticky dough. Add 2 1/2 cups of flour and knead in. Knead for 5 minutes. Your dough will be still be a little sticky. Add the oil to a bowl and roll your dough in it. Let rise for 2 hours, punch down and rise for another hour. For the filling: Divide your dough in half. Take one half and split it into 3 sections. You will need to roll this out in a long oval. Spread a little melted butter across the dough. You do not want too much or it will make your dough very soggy. Mix cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg together. Now sprinkle your mixture of sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg over the dough. (Don't use too much. This mixture will make two whole braids or 6 rolled out sections.) Once you have done this, roll up the dough. Now do this two more times. Once you have 3 pieces done, braid them together. Do the other half to the dough the same way. Tuck the ends under and let rise for 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees for 28 to 30 minutes. This recipe makes two braids! For the glaze: Mix the melted butter, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla together. Take a spoon and drizzle over a cooled braid. Top with pecans and 3 cherries. Serve with coffee, milk or orange juice on Christmas morning. This is AMAZING!",
    "1 1/2 Tbl. grated ginger\n1 lemon\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 teaspoon yeast\ncool water\nclean 2-liter bottle or growler jug\n1. Juice the lemon and set it aside.  2. Pour the sugar into the bottle.  4. Pour the yeast into the bottle. Shake the bottle so that the yeast and sugar are mixed well.  5. Pour the ginger and the lemon juice into the bottle.  6. Fill the bottle about one-quarter full of cold water and shake well again, so that everything's mixed well and the sugar and yeast are dissolved.  7. Fill up the bottle with water until nearly but not quite full, leaving an inch or two of space from the lid.  8. Leave out the bottle in a warm spot for 2-3 days, or until it's carbonated to the degree you want. Then chill the ginger ale in the fridge and enjoy. (You'll probably want to filter the ginger ale as you pour it into the glass. Otherwise you'll get little bits of grated ginger stuck on your lips.)  Warning: If you leave the bottle too long in the warmth, you risk the bottle exploding.  Feel free to fiddle around with the amounts of ginger, lemon or sugar, as you like. Personally, I've found that 1 cup of sugar seems the perfect amount, for me, at least. Even a scant bit less makes the soda bland; a little bit more gets syrupy sweet.",
    "3 cups all-purpose flour\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n1 3/4 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n1 large egg\n6 tablespoons ice water\n1. Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and mix together with your fingertips or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. 2. Mix the egg with the water in a small bowl. Toss the mixture gently with the butter mixture until the dough comes together; do not overwork it. Divide the dough in half. Flatten each half with the palm of your hand to form a thick disk. Wrap both disks in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. 3. Remove 1 disk of dough from the refrigerator. Unwrap it and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface or between 2 sheets of wax paper to form a circle about 1/8-inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pie plate. Work quickly, as the dough can become sticky. 4. Use a spatula to help lift the dough and fold it loosely in half, then in quarters. Gently transfer the dough to the pie plate, placing the corner of the dough in the center of the plate. Open up the dough and press it lightly into the plate to fit. (If the dough should tear, just press it gently together.) Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. 5. Repeat the rolling process with the second disk of dough to make the top crust. The circle of the top crust should be 10 inches in diameter.",
    "1 chicken carcass or leftover bones from several legs, wings etc.\n1 stalk celery\n1 onion\n1 carrot\n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed (optional)\n3-4 cloves garlic, crushed (optional)\n1 bunch fresh thyme or 2-3 tsp dry\nPut everything in a big pot. Pour in enough water to cover the bones and veggies. Bring to a boil then turn to low heat. Skim off any foamy stuff that comes to the top of the broth. Simmer for about 3 hours (split up the time throughout the day if necessary - if you can watch the stove so long). Check periodically to stir up a little and add more water if it has evaporated too much (keep it at the level you started). After cooking, remove all the big pieces of chicken bones and vegetables with tongs or a spoon. There's no more flavor left in the vegetables or meat, so you can discard. The broth should look golden and delicious :) Let cool then strain out the broth to get rid of any small pieces of veggies, etc. and put in a big tupperware, or jar. If freezing, store in a freezer safe container or zip-lock bags after cooling. One easy way to use the fresh broth right away is to make a vegetable soup! Cut up your favorite veggies into small pieces (I used onion, celery, carrots, potatoes and cauliflower). Saute the veggies in a little olive oil, then pour in some broth to cover. Cook until vegetables are tender. This is also great to add noodles (and leftover chicken) too for chicken noodle soup!",

Add the salt and sugar and cook until dissolved. Add the fennel seeds, garlic, thyme and fennel fronds and remove from the heat. Let cool completely (or reduce the amount of water in the brine by 2 cups and add 4 cups ice cubes to cool down immediately). Transfer the brine to a plastic container, add the pork, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. For the smoked pork: Remove the pork from the brine, rinse well with cold water and pat dry. Put on a rack set over a baking sheet and refrigerate (to allow a crust, or skin, to form on the outside) for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours. Remove the grill grate and ceramic plate from the cooker. Add the hot hardwood charcoal and scatter the soaked wood chips over the top. Put on the ceramic plate and the grill rack, close the cover, bring the temperature to between 300 and 325 degrees F and allow to smoke for 10 minutes. Brush the entire loin with oil and sprinkle with pepper. Place on the rack, close the cover and smoke at 140 degrees F until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers, 1 to 1 hour 30 minutes. While the pork smokes, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey. Start brushing it on the pork about 30 minutes before it is done. When done, remove, loosely tent and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. For the fennel gremolata: Cut the fennel into small dice and coarsely chop the fronds; put in a bowl. Add the zest and juice and drizzle with a little olive oil; mix to combine. Let sit at room temperature.

Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy and begins to smell of yeast. Add the flour and butter to the yeast mixture. Attach the dough hook to the stand mixer and, on medium-low speed, combine the mixture until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and appears shiny, roughly 4 to 5 minutes. Spray a large bowl with non-stick spray (or lightly grease with vegetable oil) and place dough in greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Place bowl in a warm area and let dough rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Place an oven rack in the top third of your oven, and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Spray parchment paper with non-stick spray. Set aside. In a large pot, bring the 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a rolling boil. Place the dough on a greased surface, and divide into 16 equal pieces (If you weigh dough, like I do, they will be about 2.20 oz. each). Roll each piece into a long rope, roughly 12 inches long. Carefully wrap half of each piece around a third of a hot dog. Pinch the ends together to seal the dough. If you run out of hot dogs before dough, make regular pretzels. Cut a little more dough off (3 oz.), and shape as desired. Place each shaped pretzel on the parchment lined baking sheet. Boil the shaped pretzels and pretzel dogs, one at a time, in the baking soda water for 30 seconds each. Using a slotted spatula or spider strainer, remove each pretzel dog from the water and place it on a drying rack to allow any extra baking soda mixture to drip off. Place the boiled pretzel dogs back on the parchment lined baking sheets. Brush with beaten egg yolk and sprinkle with pretzel or kosher salt. Bake until golden brown, roughly 10 1/2 minutes (14 to 15 minutes for large pretzels). Transfer pretzel dogs to a cooling rack for a few minutes before serving. Serve with a variety of mustards or cheese sauce.",

    "2 poblano/pasilla peppers\n1 onion, chopped\n3 fresh corn, kernels cut off\n1/2 cup chicken/veggie broth or water\nsplash cream/whole milk\n1/4 pound queso fresco, cubed\nChar the peppers. Poblano pepper skins have a slightly bitter taste so you need to get it off. In order to do this you have 2 options. If you have a gas stove that produces a flame, char the peppers over the flame until the skin is black and blistered over the whole pepper. I have an electric stove so what I do is set the oven to broil and move one of the racks up to the very top. Broil the peppers, rotating as soon as the skin by the broiler is black, until it's charred on all sides. Put the charred peppers in a plastic bag or in a bowl covered in plastic as soon as they're done being charred to steam it so the skin peels off easily. Peel the peppers. Some peppers are a little spicy so wearing gloves could be useful. Peel all the skin off the peppers. Then remove the stem, seeds and veins. Slice into strips. Heat some olive or vegetable oil over medium heat in a pan big enough to hold all the corn and peppers. Saute the onion until clear and fragrant. Add the corn kernels, peppers and broth. Simmer covered for about 15 minutes. Add the splash of cream and remove from heat. Stir in cheese and enjoy.",

Add the sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, orange zest and cloves and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for about an hour. In the meantime, make the chocolate sauce. Combine the chocolate and cream in a small saucepan and set over low heat. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is just melted, and then remove from the heat and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the vanilla, cinnamon and cayenne pepper. If necessary, whisk in a little bit of water to loosen the sauce. Set aside in a warm place. Pour about an inch of oil into a wide, shallow saucepan and set over medium-high heat. When a small piece of batter sizzles after you drop it into the oil, you are ready to fry. Drop rounded teaspoons of the batter into the oil in small batches and fry for about 2 minutes on each side, turning once, until golden brown. Drain the fritters on paper towels, dust with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately with the chocolate sauce (if it has thickened too much, you may need to reheat the sauce gently, whisking constantly, and add a bit more water).",
    "2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter\n1 1/4 cups superfine sugar\n4 cups all-purpose flour\nBlanched almonds or pistachio nuts to decorate\nCream the butter and beat it until it becomes white. Add the sugar, beating constantly for about 5 minutes, until it is a smooth cream. Add flour gradually, working it in by hand. Although no liquid is added, this makes a very soft dough. If the dough is too soft, add a little more flour. Take walnut-sized lumps, roll them into balls, and flatten them slightly. Place them on a baking sheet a little apart from each other, as they spread slightly. Stick a blanched almond or pistachio on top of each one. Bake in a 325F oven for 2030 minutes. Do not let the ghorayebah overcook. They must remain very white: they taste quite different if they are even slightly brown. Let them cool before you try to move them. An exquisite variation is to replace 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup ground hazelnuts. You can flavor the dough with a grating of nutmeg, or 12 teaspoons of cinnamon or ground cardamom. Another traditional shape for ghorayebah is little bracelets. Roll the dough into 4-inch-long sausage shapes about 1/2 inch thick, and bring the ends together to make bracelets. Decorate with split almonds or pistachios.",

But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

Dust mites are something I’ve always suspected but was not officially diagnosed with it until I took the test. Growing up, I’ve always had cold urticaria but that seem to have disappeared only to be replaced with sun sensitivity. And there’s so little known about PMLE like I just wanna know what’s going on with my body. I feel so helpless. I just wanna be out and sunbathe and not to be so itchy the next day.",
    "Me and my wife moved to Alabama to take care of my grandparents, my grandfather has dementia and my grandma, Well she just has a bad habit of not doing stuff and just praying everything will work out. They moved to Alabama to our current house to live with my great uncle. He passed away without an updated will while verbally he said the house was going to my grandparents his will was made in the 1990s. We got the house probated and my grandpa ended up being the owner of the estate. My grandma told me that they had it put in their name and that they were going to make a will. After my grandpa passed away I found out that they neither put the house in their name nor did they make a will. Dose my grandma inherit the estate of my great uncle? Or are we going to have to probate the house again?",
    "Kind of following up on my earlier post. I've managed to get Mech Assault's .xiso extracted and onto my console's hdd via ftp networking but it won't boot. Am I missing something? When I try to rip it with dvd2xbox, it says it failed to get like 5 out of 90 files. I've tried ripping it twice with the same results. I don't want to keep trying to rip it or play it off the disc and contribute to burning out my disc drive. Not sure why the install isn't working. Anything obvious I'm missing? I was also wondering if anyone has actually played Mech Assault on a modded og xbox. Maybe there's just a compatibility issue with Evo x and the game. The game boots up and plays just fine if I do try to play it off the disc and it doesn't look damaged so I don't think it's a problem with the disc",
    "Missing 411 cases fascinate me in part because they really come closest to feeling like the closest real-life analogue to a Cthulhu-esque horror. In the Cthulhu books, these types of beings were portrayed as completely alien and unfathomable, like there is no way to understand their intentions or desires, they are just on another level entirely. They are also irresistibly powerful, mere humans have no hope of overpowering them or defeating them. In Missing 411 cases, we have no idea why this is done to people and what they get out of it, but there is a clear intelligence to which victims are taken, when they are taken, and how they are taken. Also, the entity responsible seems to have no constraints, taking people even from crowded areas and always being able to avoid being witnessed by other people or even security cameras. The implications of this phenomena are utterly terrifying and fascinating.",

    "Hi everyone, I’ve been selling for just over a year, launched 3 relatively successful products, and recently launched a fourth in the health and beauty category which has been a complete disappointment. I felt I had done my research, had invested in great photos and spent time making a keyword rich listing, but found the lower price point to be far lower than I expected to get even one or two sales. Long term I am struggling to see how I can make profit margins when I include PPC/VAT. Seems like there is now an ongoing price war in the niche and I can’t see anyone making money. I can always try to drive external traffic sources, improve the listing and drive more reviews, but when do you decide it’s not worth the investment with this ASIN and move on? A lot of gurus online talk about their biggest “failures”, but I had always felt there was a solution to most challenges that can be overcome by improvements to the listing or advertising approach before giving up. At what point do people pull out of a product line and decide this is a “failure” and not worth further investment?",
    "I’ve been talking to this girl for a while now and even though she tells me that she feels comfortable with me, it doesn’t feel like she is. She doesn’t send many pictures of herself even though I do and I also tell her she’s very pretty when she sends a picture or when she turns her camera on when we call. But she just doesn’t seem very comfortable with showing her face a lot. Also sometimes I feel like maybe I’m too clingy and I just want to be talking to her all the time and maybe that makes her uncomfortable. I’m also very open about how I feel about us and how I hope that in the future we can be together and even though she has told me that she wants to be with me too, sometimes it doesn’t feel like it. I don’t know maybe I’m just overthinking the whole thing and she does want to be with me but she’s just not as open about her feelings as I am.",
    "I'm slowly starting back up in the dating pool after a long term relationship and I think that probably the worst part about it is I relocated due to my job, and the city I'm in is considered one of the worst in the US for trying to find a relationship. So many reports of how the hookup culture hears vastly outweighs the dating culture. Definitely made me a bit worried, but maybe I'll get lucky. Also, aside from how bad dating apps have gotten from all of the extra features that help less and the addition of triple the pay walls for some apps, is it just me or has the landscape gotten more kinky? I mean, I look around and there are so many who mention that they have a kink. It definitely makes me a proven vanilla that much harder to find someone out there, and I'm already looking in a smaller pool of potential dates since I would love someone on the more nerdy/geeky side",
    "I think the title is self explanatory. It’s true. When I have a crush I hate myself for having a crush on them. Because I know that I can’t do anything about it. And although I would like to confess I’m actually scared of them saying yes. Weird right? I mean I’m supposed to happy if my crush says yes to goin g out with me but for me it’s the opposite. Because I know that when we’re together all I’m going to think about is when we break up. Where I’m going to break up with them. What the reason should be for me breaking up with them. And how I should break up with them. And that feeling makes me feel so guilty because this precious person is giving me their all and here I am being a half-assed person. But I can’t help myself from having a crush, it just happens. I feel sorry for whoever I come to like and come to date. I feel like I’m going to be lonely until the end of time.",
    "So I spent a day with my boy bestfriend and we went out and got food and spoke and we just had fun. Later when we were at his house he was being really comfortable and he cuddled me and was being different. I felt bad for liking it and wanting to take it further. It felt wrong to be like that with him so I broke up with my boyfriend. But that wasn't the only reason I broke up with him, I realized I didn't want to kiss him or anything anymore and I feel like I subconsciously moved him back to \"friend\" in my mind. And I'm 17 and realized I didn't really want such a serious relationship right now, or a relationship at all rn. So after that my boy bestfriend made a move and now he wants a relationship but I don't, but I liked it when he kissed me. So I don't know what to do",
    "I believe that the tech market will be down on Monday. The report was quite positive, smashing expectations for new jobs. There is other stuff. But I see value stocks back in play for Monday. Rotation out of tech for a day or two, and then back into tech for April. The fact that the report was positive sounds positive overall, but more jobs means more workers, and more people being out and about and spending on basic necessities that they needed. I can’t imagine this translating to more spending on tech stocks. I think there’s still value in some tech stocks, which is why I say April will be green overall, but I’m talking Monday open after Easter. Historically seems to be more favored to a down day also. Thoughts?",
    "My mom notably would always say she was gonna “drive away from the house” and leave, and stuff similar to that. My parents would always fight and actually get in legitimate fights with each other and I remember once when I was younger, they made me pick between which parent I wanted to stay with because I thought they were moving away from each other. I used to look back on this stuff and not think it was horrible, I don’t even know if I think it’s horrible now because I’m used to it. I remember once my dad would chase me with his belt around a table, I don’t know why he did this but he did, I must’ve done something to deserve it.. I remember being beaten/hit by both of them for reasons i don’t even know. i think being afraid of saying something wrong and having my stuff taken away from me as a consequence transferred over to me being this antisocial person that has trouble talking and being vulnerable with people.. anyway enough rambling, does that stuff cause abandonment issues/other things?",
    "For those freaking out about the price differences, think of it in comparison to the credit bureaus. Your credit scores are not the same across the board. Each bureau has a different way of calculating your score, and some have different information. But eventually, it all all even up and be closer to one another. If you are already getting restless and impatient, maybe you shouldn’t be investing in crypto or stocks for that matter. Everyone needs to take a chill, sit back and enjoy the ride. Buy the dips if you want to get more, but hold on to your coins and let the system do the work for you. If you are super worried about losing money, just pull out your initial investment once you make money, and let your profit do the work. But you’re gonna regret it when it takes off and you sold potential millions.",
    "Brief as backstory. My mother is emotionally damaged, severely, not her fault, but resulted in an upbringing where by the age of 9 I was taken to a lot of psychologists to find out “ what was wrong with me”. I left home when I was 14, stayed an aunt until I was 17, moved out and made my own life. Fast forward 13 years, I have a degree, job, house, kids everything I wanted, 2 weeks ago my mum was supposed to be attending a family event but decided not to go, but wanted to come and visit my kids and stay at our house. It’s been 1.5 years since we saw her last so I said yes. She came, was her typical self, this time I felt sorry for her as supposed to getting angry at her for her behaviours - she’ll tell my daughter they’ll go do something then say no she’s too tired. Anyway, since she’s left, I cannot shake the feeling of how I used to feel when I was 14. Things were never good enough, I wasn’t going to go far in life, my achievements aren’t really achievements. Then she texts and asks about only ONE of her grandchildren, typical her behaviour. I’ve talked to my husband about it, I’ve trained hard at the gym gone for extra runs. I’m short with my own kids which isn’t usual for me, I cannot fathom why she is doing the exact same thing she did to me and my brothers now she’s trying to divide my kids, she knew exactly what she was doing, she’s horrible - asked multiple times when my second child’s birthday was. I can’t seem to calm down from this, like I say, I’ve reverted right back to 14 and all those feels associated with that and it sucks.",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "This is like day 5 and i woke up this morning with like no withdrawal symptoms and no cravings. I basically just took supplements, drank a lot of water and coffee, and smoked weed at night. Honestly i think the supplements are what helped the most I strongly encourage who ever is quitting to take ashwagandha, Htp-5, and Rhodiola Rosea Extract two of each twice a day. Its been giving me the biggest boosts of serotonin and as i did feel the withdrawal symptoms this dramatically reduced them. I’m telling you if you are struggling take these and you will feel soo much better. And also smoke weed or take CBD if you like, it kinda takes the edge off. But i like these supplements so much I’ll probably take them for a long time",
    "I use syncthing on my Android phone and my PC to sync photos and ebooks etc. I thought it might be a good idea to tell my client to then only sync when I'm on my home network to save a bit of battery when I'm out and about and need it more. I don't really need it to sync to my PC while I'm out anyway, I can wait for it to do so automatically when i get home. I enabled location permissions and got it working, but was bummed to find that out requires location to be on to figure out what network I'm connected to. I never turn my location on at home because I don't need to use GPS to find my way around my house, 😆. Seems a really weird and silly way for this to work. Why can't it tell what SSID I'm on and figure without turning on my GPS. Are there any good workarounds besides leaving sync on all the time or turning location on when I'm at home?",
    "I have been taking klonopijn daily for around 5 years now. Recently since the pandemic started and my life started to fall apart before my eyes, I was upped in my dosage. Then I was upped again, and again, and again. Now I am at the point of taking 6mg-8mg/day. It has gotten completely out of control and made my situation from covid even worse and less manageable. and I almost have no tolerance. I want to start a taper, not an aggressive one, that will help bring me back down to at least 1mg/day. Could this be done in a couple of months? If so does anyone have good taper recommendations. Furthermore, considering the stress will feel at times almost unbearable, does anyone know of any good anti stress replacements or anything that can be taken during this process?",
    "Argus new changes in the advanced server is really bad. This is due to his base Physical Atk and growth being nerfed significantly. Furthermore we got a stun duration nerf for a range buff, but a range buff wasn’t needed yet that stun duration is crucial and the reason why i would even call it argus best skill.  all of this huge nerfs just for passive being 320% yet this depends on his physical atk so the nerfs actually nerfs this buff as well. So in conclusion. This changes overall nerfs argus. Current live argus is great tbh. a small buff instead to like 280% is suffice or just the quality of life like the animation stop i would say instead of basically nerfing him more in terms of dmg cause -75 is A LOT",

    "Every so often I have troubles getting an erection. I’m a 24yo male and shouldn’t have this issue. With my ex it was like a gust of wind could get it up. Now not so much. And as this happens every so often it affects my perspective of my feelings for her. It makes me question if I love her or not or if it’s my body telling me I am not attracted when I don’t actually feel that way. It’s depressing and I am on lexapro and know that can be a factor but am I crazy for thinking this . Is it just a snowball effect because of that? Is this a normal occurrence for people sometimes.

I've known what it's like to be in the darkest place in the world, and I really don't want to go back. Today, I had a lot of fun going out with a friend to watch Godzilla vs Kong and walk around town for a bit. At the end of the day, I came back home and just realized \"Man, everything is so damn awful when we aren't hanging out\". That led to a lot more thinking about how much I'm fucking up my life by failing tons of my classes, how much time I spend sitting here being a worthless person, and how I'm such a burden on everyone. Literally nothing seems fun unless I'm around them, and I think it's sad that, even though I have blood relatives, the only person I consider to be family is him. I guess I don't want to be loved, I want to feel loved. I really hope this is just an episode and not something worse. Sorry for the rant, but hey, I didn't make you read this.",

Couldn’t possibly imagine being prepared for a ton of people trying to play and having your server situation figured out beforehand so you don’t look as incompetent as every other crap gaming company in existence today.

    "Hey y’all, struggling Christian here with a question. When I pray alone I feel like I’m talking to myself. It feels weird because prayer is kind of like a letter to god so it shouldn’t feel like a conversation. But then I started think that all of the good feelings I get come from within me like happiness, joy, or excitement. Those are all internal feeing that can show through my expressions and words but at their core they are from my brain. And I used to think I needed to thank God for those feelings because he was the one that put them there. But now I feel like those good feelings I get are just a reaction based on what’s happening around me and to me. So my questions is: is it possible gods love comes from ourselves rather then from him? And if so why would I need God anymore?",

I also live with my fiancé and so when they interviewed me she asked all about him as well since we live in the same household. I figured we wouldn't receive any benefits because he made okay money then and was not laid off. At the time of the interview I did verbally tell my caseworker that he was not working at that moment only due to complications with covid shut down everything. She still had me send over his last 2 check stubs and then we ended up getting approved. I was shocked but excited. Cut to now.

One thing I’ve learned about is how much I dissociate and how this has been a defense mechanism since was a kid.  She has been gently letting me know that I may have some degree of DID or dissociative identity disorder.  This was pretty scary at first but I’m thinking that she may be on to something.  I don’t have multiple identities on the outside that anyone would notice, but it’s clear that my childhood trauma caused me to have splintered off parts of self that have never been integrated.  Those parts of self are in regular conflict with each other and the result is anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.

I think short sides and longer hair on top is so attractive and I want to look like that but I’m always worried I couldn’t pull it off.

Something along the lines of \"this type of trap has active and dynamic effects, and different aspects of it may have countermeasures\", kind of thing?  Or should I leave it to them to figure out.  I don't want to hand hold too much, but it also kind of sucks to be taking part in a 'mini-game' and not even know its happening.

I have also in recent years educated myself on basic programming so I also have an interest in how the stock market is run by computer. The program/s that run it is no doubt a monster. So, that leads me to a question. What is the likely hood that a stock can be 'throttled' so it doesn't rise as it should? The calculations tweaked so it is less responsive to growth. Assuming the rise of a stock is a linear rise, what if they set it so that it is a non-linear rise, finally topping out at a pre-specified amount? Who runs the software and servers that handle all of this? Is there a company that does it? The government? I've never heard anything on this subject, ever.",

My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

And on the internet I thought I had a chance to feel more comfortable, and act freely to be myself.

I try to be outgoing and social, but when people tell me Im being annoying it makes me feel stupid. And sometimes I tell myself, “be yourself”.

We broke up about 6 years ago. And while she moved on after couple of months Ive not been able to do the same thing even after 6 years. Not a day goes by when I don’t think about her. We haven’t talked since several years and i don’t want to disturb her life now. Every-time I initiate dating someone all i see is her face what would be her reaction on that joke or how would she react. She has a boyfriend now. While I’m still miserable. Trust me Ive tried moving on. Tried online dating. Tried everything. But she just cant go away from my mind. Her memories have become a painful comfort. Why do you think this is happening and what should I do to get over her? Ive tried therapy Ive tried burning mementos. But she is tattooed inside my mind.",
    "Covid is a contagious and deadly virus, no matter what people have read on their shady \"news\" sites or watched in YouTube videos. Actual experts and their advice exist. However, as a therapist, I am expected to validate thoughts and resulting ignorant actions as though it could be truth. I'm tired of it. Adults have a responsibility to educate themselves and recognize propaganda. In this case, the ignorance is killing people. Yet, I have to look them in the eye and pretend to understand their views so that I don't cause THEM more psychological harm as they breathe freely in my space without masks during a deadly pandemic. I don't love shaming people but if anyone should be, it is them. People I know have suffered. Some have died. But I can't, because somehow it is just expected that I'll put my health at risk daily, and not doing so could cost me my job, license, etc. I'm just over it, and over these ignorant folks.",
    "Hi. I want help if anyone can spare a few words of encouragement. I wrote religious on the topic of this because I am kind of a religious. I grew up catholic and I don’t follow the church a lot but I do have faith. I’ve posted her before about how my dad treats me. I’m the oldest daughter and I feel like my mom and I are used as the scapegoat to why everything is horrible for my dad. Anyway, I feel alone a lot. I pray and I feel like no one is listening. Does anyone have some scripture or words of encouragement from the Bible? I sometimes feel like I am the one in the wrong because my dad uses God and my faith against me. Anything would be great. I am going to get a keepsake with the Virgin Mary on it to keep me safe and to remind myself she is there with me. Anyway, thank you to this group. It makes me feel less alone.",
    "I’m a 23 y/o female, 5’2”, and currently weigh 141lbs. I work out 3-4 times a week and am on my feet constantly at work. I’d say I eat an overall healthy diet, cook majority of the time at home, and would describe  myself as moderately active. My concern is over the past year I have gained 10lbs and not changed any of these practices. I’ve been told the weight could be muscles or due to recently returning to school and undergoing stress but I find myself ashamed and unmotivated to continue working out and pushing myself harder. I love weights and cardio but have been finding it hard to motivate myself when I see the number on the scale going up. Am I just psyching myself out or do I need to revisit my overall health routine?",
    "My grandma passed away when I was 8 years old, over 25 years ago. She and my mom were very close; they talked almost every day and were like best friends. After she passed away it was like a light went out in my mom. Every occasion, happy or sad, has had a dark cloud over it because my grandma wasn't there. I miss my grandma too, but it makes me so sad to feel like I will never see my mom truly happy again. She is now the same age that my grandma was when she died, so all the grief is coming out even more. I am the main person she comes to for support and I don't know how to handle it. She calls me crying and says things like, \"I'm just so sad. My life would be so much better if she was still alive.\" I feel like I need to be the \"parent\" and support my mom because she is always so sad all the time.  I was wondering if anyone else was in a similar situation or had any words of advice or wisdom. Thank you.",
    "I had a dream when I was sitting on my couch at night with a girl I didn’t recognize. Although I didn’t recognize her she felt so familiar and it felt like I knew every thing about her. Her brother walked in through the front door and said something that frustrated her. I put my arm around her and then realized that I don’t know her, but she looked at me and put my hand back around her. We fell asleep like that and when I woke up she was gone. I went into my room and there were all these clues left around pointing to seemingly nothing. The only one I can remember is that there was an extra sticker near a power outlet that was a brand which I didn’t use. I recognized this bc I had always used a rival brand. All I can say is that the rest of the dream was me trying to find her and I never did. This last part was very vague.",

    "As a young person and recent defector of the Liberal/Democrat ideology, I have been thinking about the state of our culture and time here in America. Every day I feel myself compelled to stand up and speak in an act of revolution against the status quo. I feel as if God is telling me to follow my heart and speak the truth as an artist against the untruth. But fear is prevalent. Most art, film, music, writing are dominated by ideologically liberal leaning people. Websites where artists gather to advertise their work like YouTube and Facebook are censoring and banning voices that have Conservative values and ideas. How far can I get as an artist down this path? I feel like a bird being forced to crawl on the ground feeling so desperate and hopeless wanting to use the gift and passion my God has given me. In this time when the voice of a conservative is a revolutionary act, are there enough minds out there that would support or be interested in conservative art? I want myself to be economically stable enough to support myself, my future wife, and children. Or should I find another passion?",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

But it doesn’t end there, ladies and gentlemen, I respond with “hitler was a nazi”. He says that anyone who apposes the left is a nazi so that makes him the same as a republican. I said that not everyone who apposes him is a nazi, and he replied with “that’s why we need to imprison everyone who disagrees with the left first because they are the violent ones who want to kill us.” What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People? Better watch out, this guy is gonna run for president and imprison every “nazi” so that it is only pure people with his beliefs.

    "So, I’m currently trying to teach myself astrology. I find that looking at each thing in my chart helps with understanding parts of it. Like for example, my Mars in Libra is what helps me approach things more calmly and my Mercury in Capricorn helps me to formulate my sentences before saying them. But what I have trouble with is putting everything together. I’ve been reading up on aspects and patterns as well, but I just get so confused. It’s like I have the puzzle pieces but I don’t know how to put them together. So I was wondering how everyone here got the hang of reading charts as a whole instead of just their parts?

Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",
    "With such an epic story, you would think someone like Stone would produce an epic film. From the random accents of the characters (specifically, I have no idea what Jolie was trying to do), to some pretty atrocious acting from Farrell-he's capable of much better, but this was at the height of his grandiosity and ego. There are so many moments where it feels like the film is onto something, only to have it stop and spin off into another, pointless direction. Bottom line: a $155 mil film about Alexander the Great should have been iconic, but Alexander falls flat on its face from the weight of the egos involved.",
    "The film is dark humoured, satiric and mocking mirror of society reflecting on human's obsession to fit in certain rules of society, despite how ridiculous they are. We step on our primary feelings and ignore our instincts just to play by the rules, to belong. And even it was the clear theme of being obsessed with being in a couple, I see it as a bigger reflection of society. After the main character runs into the woods, where he finds rebels of coupling, it's clear that they are as extreme as the hotel people. It looks like it's shown that people have to belong to survive, but options are limited and you have to obey, pretend or risk to be destroyed. Various examples of dysfunctional relationships are shown in the film, which looks so familiar – pretending to have something in common, pretending that you understand that you are the same. Desperation, rejection, cruelty in the relationships – we have seen and know it all, but director found the way to remind it with a lighter tone, with the possibility to laugh at ourselves and society. All the characters acted and talked in the same hyper-polite manner – that's what we do, so often we dance around difficult and extreme situations with our repressed feelings. And despite how similar everyone talked, with the same tone and politeness, we can see through that and find individuality of the characters, and it shows that we are more than just rules, etiquette  The obsession to have something in common with you partner reached the peek at the end. It looked like even David and blind women are still in love, but a realisation that in society norms they don't have anything real in common drives to an extreme decision. It shows that we sacrifice so much if we love someone different, and all just to be more acceptable in the society, but at the end society doesn't care, so do we just have to be braver? This film makes more think than feel. The audience who is used to relate to the characters might find it difficult, as even the main character is not very lovable, he is a week and very human in other words. It's not a 'feel good' film but not miserablism, it's smart and innovative reminder",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "I just watched this movie last night for the first time. I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.<br/><br/>The movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.<br/><br/>I feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.<br/><br/>If I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it. It's too late now - I can't get it out of my head. I don't think I've ever been affected this much by a movie.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "First of all, Seven Years In Tibet is a very aesthetically pleasing film. The snowy Himalayas, the Tibetan villages, and the amazing costumes and religious ceremonies are all filmed beautifully, with rich colours and lighting. The music by John Williams is also excellent, and it's fascinating to hear how it blends with the unusual Tibetan music.<br/><br/>It's not all surface though, there's depth here too. Don't believe the negative comments about Brad Pitt's acting. Admittedly his accent slips a bit in places, but he does a great job as Heinrich, both the unpleasant, arrogant character at the beginning, and the more gentle and wise man that he becomes as the film progresses. His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental. The film is well edited; scenes are not drawn out any longer than they need to be. As a whole, it is fast paced but also peaceful, tender and moving. You don't get bored but you're not bombarded with pointless action scenes either.<br/><br/>It's a pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood film where women and other cultures aren't treated as objects, and are allowed to be full, complex characters. It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.<br/><br/>Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended.",
    "Ice age 3 was really funny and it stays true to the series. Same old characters, a whole new adventure that everyone at any age can enjoy.<br/><br/>I saw the critics and I thought to my self that it would be good, but I didn't expect much, but I really did enjoy it more than I thought. It may not be the best compared to the other Ice Age films, but it still a great thrill ride that the audience can enjoy.<br/><br/>And if you find a theater near you that has it in digital 3D, go and watch it in 3D, because the action and adventure will excite you even more than it actually does.<br/><br/>Normally people think since it's a third part, then the movie won't be that great, but hear me when I say that keep that thought out of your mind and parents, take your kids with you, they are sure to leave with a smile and a long lasting excitement for more.<br/><br/>100% enjoyable, its a 10!",
    "I love this movie! It was so adorable, so charming & the writing was absolutely terrific! I love the animation & the characters (including the minions) were all fantastic! A MUST WATCH!",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. <br/><br/>The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! <br/><br/>For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it. Go see this.",
    "I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.<br/><br/>Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "I am written this review In Memorie of my all time favorite the best horror director Wes Craven that sadly is no longer with us anymore. On August 30th 2015, Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him. <br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. <br/><br/>The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death, I love it!!! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my number 1 favorite film in the franchise it stays in my heart forever. I am a big fan of this film I even have a poster hang on door in my room, my girlfriend give it to me as gift. I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare, Scream, Shocker,The People Under the Stairs, Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross $26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream , New Nightmare, Shocker and The People Under the Stairs. <br/><br/>The first film is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams, a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers, can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams, you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger, she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams, but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever, smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put booby-traps for Freddy? Awesome!<br/><br/>Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss, is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. <br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. <br/><br/>Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films. <br/><br/>John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson, Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome, I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. <br/><br/>I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is the best classic slasher film,one of the best horror movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. My number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film, it is fast paced, entertaining, not boring or over long film, but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
    "Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as \"Sergeant Major Dickerson\",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.",
    "We all remember being a teenager.  A crazy, intense time when your high were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant.<br/><br/>John Hughes movie brilliantly captures that environment, that era in our lives, and all the social rifts that we all helped to create for ourselves. I have heard it said that \"The Breakfast Club\" is melodramatic, overacted, and simplistic.  If you subscribe to that flippant perspective you might as well join Vernon in his office because you are doing the same thing that he did.  Seeing the movie as you want to see it, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.<br/><br/>If you really want to understand this film, think back to your own high school days.  Think about your last year there.  Dig out your old diary or book of angstful poems and reaquaint yourself with who you were then, when you felt things more deeply.  \"The Breakfast Club\" does not exist not for highschool kids, as some suggest.  Why would they need it?  They live there. It exists for all of us who have already been through there, who feel that they are above it now.  It exists so that we can remember what it was like and better understand ourselves, and the next generation.  Because you can't dismiss something you understand.",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br/><br/>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br/><br/>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br/><br/>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br/><br/>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br/><br/>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br/><br/>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are great again<br/><br/>Charm returns<br/><br/>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Only one movie with Baby Groot?

    "I have only ever seen this film once, I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence.  I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment.",
    "As most are undoubtedly aware this is the film that the director virtually expunged from his repertoire. But why did Stanley Kubrick really disown SPARTACUS (1960)? The answer can be summed up in two words: absolute control. Kubrick wanted total administrative as well as artistic authority over the making of the film about a revolt of gladiators and slaves in ancient Rome.<br/><br/>But you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY (1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well. Only three weeks into what would prove to be an incredibly complex and arduous production, Douglas fired venerable director Anthony Mann (RAW DEAL, RAILROADED,THE FURIES, THE NAKED SPUR, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, MAN OF THE WEST, etc.) from SPARTACUS. With only two days notice, Kubrick was hired to replace him.<br/><br/>Shooting PATHS OF GLORY, Douglas had confined his criticisms and objections to Kubrick's failed rewriting of the script (they went with the original screenplay). Douglas' complaints and artistic influence were far greater on SPARTACUS, much to Kubrick's chagrin. Though the director craved autonomy over every aspect of the film, Douglas would not budge. A tense compromise was reached but ultimately Douglas had the last word. Kubrick saw himself as just a hired gun. And he would never allow himself to be placed in this position again.<br/><br/>Later, both men would complain about the film's outcome and each other. They never made another movie together. <br/><br/>But SPARTACUS is no uneven patchwork of divergent ideas. The film is cohesive and arresting. At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.",
    "I think this film is wonderful. It is sheer entertainment for kids and hilarious for adults.<br/><br/>I first watched this movie age 7, and i loved it...now i watch it again age 14 and I'm howling with laughter. The 'You wanna buy a sundial?' sequence renders me unable to breathe for laughter, whilst when i was younger it got not so much as a giggle.<br/><br/>As with all Disney films, the jokes are for the 'big kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!<br/><br/>Overall - 8/10",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.<br/><br/>And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.<br/><br/>Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.<br/><br/>The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.<br/><br/>O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",
    "This film was exceptional and one of the best I've seen this year. Watiti has great comedic vision and the cast is phenomenal. Jojo Rabbit was wierd , funny , heartwarming and heartbreaking and I think its definitely worth the watch.",
    "I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no \"Finding Nemo\" or \"Toy Story.\" But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!<br/><br/>In my opinion, Cars 1 was a little slow. It dragged a little too long in certain parts. Cars 2 suffers from no such thing.<br/><br/>To sum it up; Cars 2 may not be Toy Story but it sure is FUN and ENTERTAINING.",
    "I am truly sadden that this film got bashed so much. I hear reviews saying this film \"sucks\" or it has too many inaccuracies. Movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List have also \"some\" inaccuracies in them. (They are Masterpieces) It is pretty sad this film has been getting this bashed. It doesn't deserve to be.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is full of suspense and is directed beautifully by Kathryn Bigelow. I'd have to say this is movie truly captures the Iraq War. What a dangerous war it was for our soldiers. This movie shows us what our soldiers went through. This isn't bashing the American soldiers at all or even War. It gives us a great deal of appreciation for our troops who are risking their lives every single day for Us, Freedom and the U.S.A.<br/><br/>The true purpose of this movie is to not just praise the soldiers. But for one of the military's unrecognized heroes which are the technicians of the bombs squads who risk their lives to save others. This is the purpose of the movie to let everyone know what these people do.<br/><br/>This time and I know all of you out there, don't want to hear it, the critics are actually right. This movie is fantastically directed by Kathryn Bigelow and she rightfully deserved her Oscar for best director.<br/><br/>I know many Avatar fans out there probably rated this movie a 1, without even seeing it because it won Best Picture and Avatar didn't. This movie seems its suffering from the curse of Best Picture. More people have watched Avatar than the Hurt Locker. So of course this film has gotten bashed by so many. I think SOME of the bad reviews are the Avatar Fanboys who are just angry Avatar didn't win Best Picture.<br/><br/>Please don't just go along with the bad reviews this film has gotten from IMDb. Just try and watch this film.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a war epic, that I hope it becomes appreciative as time passes. 9/10 Highly recommended.",
    "It's funny, but I notice most of the prior comments are from guys, but speaking as a woman, this is by no means just a guy's flick. It's been one of my favorite films since the day it came out. It's got everything- drama, romance, action, and an honest to goodness story. There are even interesting themes, like the moral dilemma that Wyatt finds himself in-- Is he compelled to help fight the Cowboys even though he's \"retired\" and just wants to live out his life in peace? Is there a moral equivalence between killing for justice and killing for retribution? How far can a man go to sacrifice his own integrity and better judgment? Even though the Earps are the \"good guys\", the movie doesn't glamorize violence. Doc Holliday and some of the Earps' other sidekicks (\"Creek Johnson\" and \"Texas Jack\") are obviously pretty shady characters, but at the end of the day, are forced to choose between right and wrong, and they choose correctly. It doesn't get much better than Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and I can't for the life of me understand why he didn't get nominated for it. I also appreciate the fact that the love story between Wyatt and Josephine didn't dominate the film and take away from the real plot, ala \"Titanic\". The love story simply served its purpose in helping viewers to better understand the character of Wyatt. Also the friendship between Wyatt and Doc was portrayed tenderly but not wussily. And okay, as a woman, let me just say that there is no one sexier than Sam Elliot. Man alive, if there ever was a person born to portray a cowboy, that guy is IT. If you've never seen a Western, or are not a fan, try this movie. It will make a believer out of you.",

    "SAW III in my opinion is tied with the original as the best in the series. For many reasons- one reason being that it keeps it simple. Instead of dealing with multiple characters that sacrificed any kind of character development like in SAW's II, IV, and V, SAW III, like the original, has much fewer characters, leading to a more intimate setting where we can connect to everyone. And while it does have sub-plots, they don't feel out of place, they're not just randomly thrown in to shock audiences. They feel organic, they all connect smoothly at the end and make sense as to why.<br/><br/>If you've seen a SAW film, you know the story is going to have twists, turns, and violence/gore to accompany them. But at least SAW III does it very well. It expands on characterization and back stories for these characters and ties up the loose ends as believably as this franchise can do. We also get a deeper look at the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, knowing more about how the two really look at each other. Jigsaw is the calm, cancer-stricken anti-hero who does these evil things to prove a moral standpoint. Amanda, on the other hand, doesn't seem to grasp this - instead using the traps to torture her victims as a way to get back at innocent people for the way she was tortured herself with suicidal tendencies and drug abuse. With these two extremes, we see how much Jigsaw is trying to mentor her in his vision while she struggles with her own demons. And when Jigsaw gets ill, we see that Amanda really isn't a fitting apprentice to carry on his legacy as her vindictiveness comes out.<br/><br/>SAW III is also supported by the fact that the two protagonists are developed deeply. Maybe not as much as our two anti-heros, but we understand where they're coming from. From Lynn's dour nature to devastated Jeff's situation. The subplot with Jeff by the way adds some great underlying messages to the film. These messages shows us that hate, vengeance, revenge, and complacency brings more pain than anything else, and does not solve anything. It ruins families, destroys relationships, clouds judgment, and at the end: self-destruction. Leigh Whannell, who wrote the first two films with James Waan and flew solo writing the screenplay for this one, does a nice job giving the spotlight to all the characters instead of just focusing on Jigsaw and Amanda. He makes SAW III more of a character study than any of the other installments and that's one of the essential reasons why this installment scores high.<br/><br/>Darren Lynn Bousman directs a much more subtle film than he did with SAW II and SAW IV. The quick edits are kept to a bare minimum (thank God) and the film has a lot of dread going for it. Very moody and darkly atmospheric. He focuses on the drama and emotion at hand, which was a vast improvement on SAW II and especially SAW IV. He lets the acting and the situations do the work for him instead of being extra-fancy with the camera work. Lastly, the cinematography is a plus. Darren shoots the film with a vibrant and kinetic feel and uses good, non-queasy camera movements. I love the lighting most of all though; he uses a wide arrange in the color palette (from lime green to icy blue). He definitely proves here that he knows how to grasp the material and visualize it. His direction of III ranks alongside James Waan's mindblowing direction of the original.<br/><br/>The acting is hardly an issue. It's usually good or better. Tobin Bell can play John Kramer in his sleep by now for gods sake! He shows excellent range and is always effective in the role because he gives the character more depth than what the script probably provides. Shawnee Smith is superb as Amanda, who will always be one of my favorite characters in the series. This is without a single doubt her shining moment, her most dramatic portion in the series. You really want to hate her but you just can't because you pity her. Smith could have easily played the character as an annoying nutjob, but she gives the character substance and unbelievable humanality. Angus Macfadyen as Jeff is superb in his role as well; he makes Jeff the most realistic and sympathetic character within the entire series. As far as I'm concerned, McFayden nailed the mourning father act. Bahar Soomekh was decent but always outshone by Bell, Smith, and McFayden. Her acting was a bit flimsy at times, but for the most part she gave a nice performance and made her character likable.<br/><br/>The suspense and tension, while not as impressive as the original, is still great. Hardly any other Saw film or horror film in general for that matter (with the exception of Eden Lake from last year and Inside from 2007) has been so edge-of-your-seat gripping, so exciting. The slow pacing allows you to gradually absorb everything in, and this makes it all the more better.<br/><br/>There is a lot of extreme gore in this film, but unlike some other installments like Saws IV and V, it's done very well and serves a purpose. Jeff's bloody trials are in a lot of ways cathartic. You're enduring these horrific scenes along with Jeff, and the relief at the end that the horror is over really fits with the theme of redemption through forgiveness. Moreover, the revelation that the horror isn't over, and what you feel as a result, drives home the Shakespearean tragedy in a very personal way because you the audience have to keep enduring it.<br/><br/>SAW III is clever, solidly written, has the best characters, succeeds with the emotional aspect it was going for, and ties up loose ends perfectly. For a third installment in a horror series, it's incredibly strong.",
    "And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive \"Spider-Man\" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.",

Sure she could be scared (of being revealed to be a fraud by the true her) but not of a shadow. Again, purposeful misleading to set up the twist.<br/><br/>3. Why does the good version go insane and deciude the only way to get revenge on her evil self is to raise an army of evil duplicates that murder their good halves? Again, contrived and makes no sense.<br/><br/>4. Why didn't/ couldn't the good version of the girl use the escalators to escape the evil realm? This really doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>5. How the hell did all of the evil versions have enough food/ water to survive?<br/><br/>6. Surely not every single copy of everyone in the world was stored in the one bunker shown. So how did the \"Good\" girl convince all of the evil copies (of all the rest of the world) to arise??<br/><br/>There are probably many many MANY more issues with this film. But god does it destroy itself trying way too hard to set up a profound twist that is just completely illogical.",
    "Don't believe the negative reviews on this one. Its easily the most underrated movie I have come across, and can best be described as a hidden gem for the ones who like historical adventure/action-movies (Braveheart/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/Robin Hood) and fantasy-movies. <br/><br/>Others have described it better here on IMDb, so I am just going to say this: It is not a historical correct piece, and do not try to be. It should be viewed as a fantasy, even though the vikings portrayed and their buildings/settlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.<br/><br/>Btw: To all you who like the above-mentioned movies for the big battle-scenes and sword-fighting, don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area (even though it got them). On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in pre-medieval times. Instead of having the one super-hero defying all logic, you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie, with Banderas, Storhøi and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.<br/><br/>This is a great adventure of a movie, which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.<br/><br/>9/10 - Must see for all who like adventure/fantasy",
    "Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head. You can't help but incredulously laugh at what happens. This is all about oddballs.<br/><br/>The good. Excellent acting. Totally off the wall characters, actions and situations, yet completely logical. Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.<br/><br/>The actors. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovich play disturbingly crazy roles stuffed with delusion and heavily dosed with stupidity. While Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons seem almost out of place as the standard bearers of reason.<br/><br/>The bad. Since it's so bizarre, it won't please everyone.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. Offbeat and cooky comedy. Don't think you'll see your run of the mill kind of film and you'll have fun.",
    "I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on \"the list\" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like \"Superbad\", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of \"40 Year Old Virgin\", \"Superbad\", or \"Knocked Up\".<br/><br/>For starters, there was a definite presence of the \"TV actors on the big screen\" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of \"That 70s Show\" didn't follow her to \"Forgetting\"'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that \"Forgetting\" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than \"American Psycho 2\" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.<br/><br/>The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.<br/><br/>The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on \"CSI\") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious \"American Psycho 2\"); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with \"Superbad\"). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt \"Knocked Up\"). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write \"Fun with Dick and Jane\".<br/><br/>All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'. <br/><br/>The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events. <br/><br/>In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.<br/><br/>One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.<br/><br/>Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games). <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work. <br/><br/>These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.<br/><br/>Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.<br/><br/>What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children. <br/><br/>Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain.",
    "In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:<br/><br/>First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: \nIs Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?<br/><br/>Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.<br/><br/>During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",
    "I was talked into seeing this, and I have to shout it out, because it is a RIOT! I don't write many reviews, but when I love a film, I have to. If I have any complaint on this one, it's the title. I expected gross-out humor (\"crude\"). There isn't any, really. It's actually extremely unpredictable, subtle and extremely smart humor.<br/><br/>It has a story arc that you begin to somewhat anticipate, but you don't feel you're being patronized. Instead, you're left feeling that very intelligent people put this thing together in hopes that everyone would find something to love about it.<br/><br/>The cast is great, the animation is fun, and it's non-dizzying 3-D.<br/><br/>When I saw it, the entire audience clapped at the end, because we were entertained throughout, and found the ending really satisfying.<br/><br/>What else? Sweet emotions crop up because we can all relate to the family dynamics. Every family has the screw-up, the salt of the earth, the rebel, and the stubborn one. And it has one of the funniest babies ever put on film. A baby unlike any baby you'll ever see anywhere.<br/><br/>Very, very funny. Definitely recommend.",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.<br/><br/>Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to \"Christmas Town\". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.<br/><br/>People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! <br/><br/>10/10",
    "\"Atonement\" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. <br/><br/>Act I begins like an upper-class comedy of manners. The setting is the Tallis family's stately home, on a hot summer's day in 1935. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old with ambitions to be a writer, has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins, but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them. Robbie has fallen in love with Cecilia and accidentally sends her a sexually explicit love-letter. In other circumstances this might have resulted in disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one. The tone of the film changes abruptly, however, when Briony's cousin Lola is sexually assaulted. Lola cannot identify her assailant, but Briony, who was a witness, falsely accuses Robbie. As a result, he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison. <br/><br/>In Act II, set in 1940, Robbie, released from jail, is now a soldier with the British Army in France. He is desperately trying to reach Dunkirk ahead of the advancing Germans, kept going not by fighting spirit or patriotism, but by the hope of returning to Cecilia, who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment, becoming estranged from her family as a result. In Act III we see Briony, now eighteen, as a volunteer nurse in a London hospital. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help him clear his name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apart.<br/><br/>After \"The Last King of Scotland\" and \"Becoming Jane\", James McEvoy is the rising male star of the British cinema, and his performance here is the best yet that I have seen. Whereas Dr Garrigan in \"The Last King\" was morally flawed, and Lefroy in \"Becoming Jane\" hid his better nature beneath a roguish exterior, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy succeeds in conveying his character's basic decency, achieving the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is another rising British star, and this is her second film with director Joe Wright after \"Pride and Prejudice\". Although she was good in the comedy \"Bend it like Beckham\", I think that her films with Wright are her best, suggesting that her future lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" in which she seemed miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the loveliest, but also the liveliest and most spirited heroine of any film I have seen recently. Special mentions must also go to Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and to Vanessa Redgrave who plays the now-elderly Briony in the epilogue, set in 1999. I felt, however, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. <br/><br/>This was only Wright's second feature film, and he has already established himself as an accomplished director. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a good film, but \"Atonement\" is better. Ian McEwan's book is among the best novels of recent years, and I doubt if any cinematic treatment could capture all its nuances. One of its themes in particular, the debate between literary traditionalism and modernism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wright and the scriptwriter Christopher Hampton wisely steer clear of it. Hampton, who has turned the book into a very good screenplay, keeps McEwan's final twist, although it is here presented in a different way, with Briony revealing the truth in an TV interview. <br/><br/>If, however, the film does not capture all the literary nuances of the novel, Wright makes up for this with his extraordinary visual imagination, something sometimes lacking in films based upon novels. \"Atonement\" joins that list of films (\"Far from Heaven\" and \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" are other examples that come to mind) where almost every scene seems composed like a painting. This is true not only of Act I, set in that beautiful stately home (actually Stokesay Court in Shropshire), but also of Act II, where Wright can find a terrible beauty even in war, especially in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot of the Dunkirk beaches in the grey morning light. Particularly moving was the scene where the British soldiers sing \"Dear Lord and Father of Mankind\". The second line of John Greenleaf Whittier's hymn is, of course, \"Forgive Our Foolish Ways\"- a particularly apt comment on war, and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the characters.<br/><br/>Also very good was Dario Marianelli's musical score, which (appropriately for a film in which writing plays an important part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping. Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that its British origins and late summer (traditionally blockbuster season) release date will not prejudice the Academy against it when it comes to next year's Oscars. 9/10",

    "Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised \" Esther's secret\" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the \"secret\" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a \"creepy\" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",
    "I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.<br/><br/>At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.<br/><br/>There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.",

    "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \"Scarface\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \"American Dream\".<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about the \"cheesiness\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.<br/><br/>This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.<br/><br/>The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.<br/><br/>Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \"Scarface\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original \"Willy Wonka\" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",

    "Mass amateurization refers to the capabilities that new forms of media have given to non-professionals and the ways in which those non-professionals have applied those capabilities to solve problems (e.g. create and distribute content) that compete with the solutions offered by larger, professional institutions. Mass amateurization is most often associated with Web 2.0 technologies. These technologies include the rise of blogs and citizen journalism, photo and video-sharing services such as Flickr and YouTube, user-generated wikis like Wikipedia, and distributed accommodation services such as Airbnb. While the social web is not the only technology responsible for the rise of mass amateurization, Clay Shirky claims Web 2.0 has allowed amateurs to undertake increasingly complex tasks resulting in accomplishments that would seem daunting within the traditional institutional model. In addition to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed a variety of digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, trackbacks, and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during the first decade of the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media. Mass amateurization is a social, cumulative and collaborative activity, wherein ideas will flow back up the pipeline from consumers and they will share them among themselves.",

    "Bass–Serre theory is a part of the mathematical subject of group theory that deals with analyzing the algebraic structure of groups acting by automorphisms on simplicial trees. The theory relates group actions on trees with decomposing groups as iterated applications of the operations of free product with amalgamation and HNN extension, via the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. Bass–Serre theory can be regarded as one-dimensional version of the orbifold theory. History\nBass–Serre theory was developed by Jean-Pierre Serre in the 1970s and formalized in Trees, Serre's 1977 monograph (developed in collaboration with Hyman Bass) on the subject. Serre's original motivation was to understand the structure of certain algebraic groups whose Bruhat–Tits buildings are trees. However, the theory quickly became a standard tool of geometric group theory and geometric topology, particularly the study of 3-manifolds. Subsequent work of Bass contributed substantially to the formalization and development of basic tools of the theory and currently the term \"Bass–Serre theory\" is widely used to describe the subject.",
    "Hemoglobin Barts, abbreviated Hb Barts, is an abnormal type of hemoglobin that consists of four gamma globins. It is moderately insoluble, and therefore accumulates in the red blood cells. Hb Barts has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, so it cannot release oxygen to the tissue. Therefore, this makes it an inefficient oxygen carrier. As an embryo develops, it begins to produce alpha-globins at weeks 5–6 of development. When both of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes which code for alpha globins becomes dysfunctional, the affected fetuses will have difficulty in synthesizing a functional hemoglobin. As a result, gamma chains will accumulate and form four gamma globins. These gamma globins bind to form hemoglobin Barts. It is produced in the disease alpha-thalassemia and in the most severe of cases, it is the only form of hemoglobin in circulation. In this situation, a fetus will develop hydrops fetalis and normally die before or shortly after birth, unless intrauterine blood transfusion is performed. Since hemoglobin Barts is elevated in alpha thalassemia, it can be measured, providing a useful screening test for this disease in some populations.",

    "High Angle Control System (HACS) was a British anti-aircraft fire-control system employed by the Royal Navy from 1931 onwards and used widely during World War II. HACS calculated the necessary deflection required to place an explosive shell in the location of a target flying at a known height, bearing and speed. Early history\nThe HACS was first proposed in the 1920s and began to appear on Royal Navy (RN) ships in January 1930, when HACS I went to sea in . HACS I did not have any stabilization or power assist for director training. HACS III which appeared in 1935, had provision for stabilization, was hydraulically driven, featured much improved data transmission and it introduced the HACS III Table. The HACS III table (computer) had numerous improvements including raising maximum target speed to 350 knots, continuous automatic fuze prediction, improved geometry in the deflection Screen, and provisions for gyro inputs to provide stabilization of data received from the director. The HACS was a control system and was made possible by an effective data transmission network between an external gun director, a below decks fire control computer, and the ship's medium calibre anti-aircraft (AA) guns.",

Typically, the different types of asset-based loans include accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, equipment financing, or real estate financing Asset-based lending in this more specific sense is possible only in certain countries whose legal systems allow borrowers to pledge such assets to lenders as collateral for loans (through the creation of enforceable security interests). Usage\nAsset-based lending is usually done when the normal routes of raising funds is not possible, such as the capital markets (selling bonds to investors) and normal unsecured or mortgage secured bank. This is often because the company has exhausted other capital raising options or needs more immediate capital for project financing needs (such as inventory purchases, mergers, acquisitions, and debt purchasing). Asset-based loans are also usually accompanied by lower interest rates, as in the event of a default the lender can recoup its investment by seizing and liquidating the assets tied to the loan.",

The simplest, or most evasive, approach is RAM-scraping, accessing the system's memory and exporting the copied information via a remote access trojan (RAT) as this minimizes any software or hardware tampering, potentially leaving no footprints. POS attacks may also include the use of various bits of hardware: dongles, trojan card readers, (wireless) data transmitters and receivers. Being at the gateway of transactions, POS malware enables hackers to process and steal thousands, even millions, of transaction payment data, depending upon the target, the number of devices affected, and how long the attack goes undetected. This is done before or outside of the card information being (usually) encrypted and sent to the payment processor for authorization. List of POS RAM scraper malware variants",

    "Michael van Gerwen (; born 25 April 1989) is a Dutch professional darts player. He is currently ranked number three in the world, having been world number one from 2014 to 2021. He is also a three-time PDC World Champion, having won the title in 2014, 2017 and 2019.  Van Gerwen began playing darts at the age of 13. He won the 2006 World Masters and threw a televised nine-dart finish at the 2007 Masters of Darts, becoming the youngest player to do both, aged 17. However, after this initial burst onto the darting scene, van Gerwen struggled for consistent form until his breakthrough year in 2012. Improving from world number 38 at the start of 2012 to number four at the beginning of 2013, he won his first major PDC title at the World Grand Prix and reached the final at the 2013 World Championship. In 2014, at the age of 24, van Gerwen became the youngest winner of the PDC World Championship, a record he still holds today, as well as being one of only five players to win it more than once. He also holds the record for the highest three-dart average in a televised darts match, with 123.4.",
    "Chakán (, ‘1) oregano of this land; 2) macaw tail feathers.’) is the name of one of the Mayan jurisdictions (kuchkabalob) that existed on the Yucatan Peninsula at the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the sixteenth century. Unlike other jurisdictions, Chakán did not seem to have a centralized government or control of a dominant Halach Uinik, as in the case of the provinces Ceh Pech or Ah Kin Chel. This is inferred from the fact that upon the Spaniards' arrival, Francisco de Montejo (el Mozo) was well received by some local leaders (batabob), but not others, such as Ah Kin Chuy, who organized resistance in the region's eastern towns to repel Spanish settlers. The most important city in the jurisdiction may have been Caucel, which controlled the region's salt trade since this material came from Chuburná and Sisal. Caucel's batab, named Ah Kin Euán, was so open to the Spanish from the outset of the conquest that he converted to Catholicism and changed his name to Francisco Euán, maintaining his position as batab for much longer.",

    "European exploration and settlement of Oceania began in the 16th century, starting with Portuguese settling the Moluccas and Spanish (Castilian) landings and shipwrecks in the Marianas Islands, east of the Philippines, followed by the Portuguese landing and settling  temporarily (due to the monsoons) in the Tanimbar or the Aru Islands and in some of the Caroline Islands and Papua New Guinea, and several Spanish landings in the Caroline Islands and New Guinea. Subsequent rivalry between European colonial powers, trade opportunities and Christian missions drove further European exploration and eventual settlement. After the 17th century Dutch landings in New Zealand and Australia, but not settling these lands, the British became the dominant colonial power in the region, establishing settler colonies in what would become Australia and New Zealand, both of which now have majority European-descended populations. States including New Caledonia (Caldoche), Hawaii, French Polynesia and Norfolk Island also have considerable European populations.

    "The flood filling game, also known as the connected dominos game, two colors and one match or the kite dominoes game was introduced by Tardos et Al in 2015 [TKSS], a year after Ailon et al had already shown that the problem was not polynomially solvable on planar maps [ASTW]. In this game a player starts with either black or white tiles and places them adjacent to at least one tile which is initially placed. These tiles are then covered (flooded) if they form a rectangle and only if all sides have an equal number of white and black squares. Once each square has been flooded we say that the board or map is filled. This process continues but only squares which can be completely covered without leaving any edge uncovered may be picked up next. We are interested in how many moves it takes so that every square in the given map gets covered, especially considering some special cases like convex polygons, rectangles, trees etc. We give polynomial time algorithms for deciding whether a map is indeed fillable using O(n^3log*n)-time algorithm to solve the minimum problem in planars or finding out if there exists a particular move sequence using SCC decompositions followed by Euler Tour technique. Further we look into the behaviour of this graph when edges incident on different SCCs' get deleted independently. With increasing knowledge about this decomposition helps us deduce certain relationships between tree width, max degree of the decomposition tree and the size of maximal clique containing vertices from more than one SCC.",

    "The increasing availability and popularity of digital pathological images have led to an active area of automatic image classification known as Digital Pathological Analysis (DPA). These algorithms aim at reducing analysis time, by using deep learning models that can replicate expert decisions. However, they are not very robust when facing variations on patient/slide characteristics which leads to limitations due to inter-observer variability and inconsistency across sites or scanners.. For example, a segmenting algorithm might be trained to correctly detect cancerous nuclei at 20X on two particular specimen slides. But if it’s deployed, will it generalize to new specimens? One answer lies with ensembling where multiple decision tree nodes make up the output classifier — this has been shown to help address such issues.. This study aims to investigate how we can leverage the sparse coding module of convolutional neural networks (CNN) together with Random Forest based decision trees as part of an ensemble machine learning strategy for better feature selection while maximizing discriminative ability . It compares against several existing nuclear segmentation strategies used in literature, achieving state of the art results both locally and globally..",
    "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6597\nA new generalization of the Inflaton with an exponential potential (IEP) model, which incorporates possible deviations to pure de Sitter expansion during inflation, has been proposed recently for providing an estimate to the primordial fluctuations in the Universe at any order with a good accuracy and simultaneously explaining all observational results on inflation with no need of an extra sector or mechanism to produce the fluctuations without contradiction with the other standard predictions on inflation. This work shows that this class of theories has interesting implications: firstly it predicts the existence of several plateau regions with specific non-vanishing values of the scalar field, leading as predicted to almost flat spectra; secondly the presence of these additional steps gives rise to primordial perturbation functions that have features similar to those obtained within the Starobinsky' s or Hills-Politzer model that can be seen as limits of our proposal. These predictions are explored with emphasis on how observable they are, but also giving them analytical expressions that we show agree very well with numerical ones and allowing us even to propose some phenomenological formulae for comparison with data.",

    "> In this paper, we propose an image segmentation model which combines normalized cut (NC) criterion with adaptive similarity measure and spatial regularization term to improve the performance of NC-based methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Firstly, we introduce a new similarity function that can be used as a general replacement for the commonly used Euclidean distance or correlation coefficient. This new similarity function has two advantages over these traditional measures: it is more robust against noise and outliers; and its parameter can be automatically determined by minimizing the objective function without any prior knowledge about the data distribution. Secondly, we incorporate a spatial regularization term into the original NC formulation so that the resulting energy functional becomes convex and thus easier to optimize. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results show that our approach achieves better segmentation quality than other state-of-the-art algorithms while being much faster due to its low computational complexity.",
    "Abstract:\nThe main purpose of this research is proposing an automated linear function submission-based double auction (ABLDS) as a real-time pricing (RTP) mechanism for large scale prosumers' electricity network in an energy system with decentralised network of prosumers, in\nwhich the main features of price elasticity of supply are accounted. In this paper, a modified double auction-based mechanism with linear functions as market-clearing bids and offers is presented for bottom-up RTP of prosumers' electricity.\n\nIn the presented mechanism, by using the linear functions each prosumer offers two linear functions as bid and offer bids, and the market-clearing bid and the market-clearing offer are generated as the highest and lowest linear functions in the bids and offers, respectively. It is also shown that, by the introduced mechanism, the price elasticity of each load is considered. The proposed algorithm has a complexity of O(n log((n))) in which n demonstrates the number of prosumers. The complexity is relatively high, but it will be significantly reduced by the fact that there are only a small number of price-elastic load that will be active in the market. Thus, ABLDS can be considered more practical\nand applicable in real world. The results showed that the RTP can be performed successfully without being affected by malicious attackers, and provides an effective mechanism for the pricing in the prosumers’ electricity network.\n\nTo find more about RTP and smart grid:\n\nRenewable Energy: A Practical Approach - The book provides comprehensive coverage of the technical and regulatory aspects of renewable applications and systems.

    "#### Abstract:\n\nRecently, social dynamics became a popular research field in computer vision. It is well known that biological organisms have the capacity to exhibit collective behaviors and social cohesion. These abilities provide an effective solution for organizing social groups and for solving collective decision-making problems. They constitute significant means of organization among biological populations exhibiting various social behaviors including the formation of groups and swarms, schooling, and flocking. A large amount of the social behavior analysis falls into the category of social physics. It is a branch of social research which seeks a physical understanding on social behavior in the same way as the molecular model or the kinetic theory of gases. A simple model of the Deffuant-Weisbuch (DW) and social dynamical systems theory is developed here for the segmentation of images. It is found that the model converges to a stable state at the global minimum. The parameters of the model are automatically extracted from the intensity and spatial coherence statistics of the input images. By using different parameter values, different levels of segmentations can be generated. Thus, by using only a simple image processing model, we can achieve multi-resolution segmentation. It is observed that the DW model is robust to different input values and image conditions. However, it is sensitive to noise. Therefore, noise must be removed from the input as part of the pre- processing step.\n\n#### Original paper:\n\nM. Z. Khan, A. R. Mahmood, T. A. Ahmad, L. Aljibouri, M. M. El-Zagzag (2012).

    "#### Abstract\n\nGiven an operation n^a acting on positive integers, we define and study the related multi operation M(n), where M(n) counts how many different operations are needed to achieve n as their product. We prove that M(n) does not take values 1/2 or larger than some C=C (practically) forever when dealing with primes. For all odd prime exponents a, the sequence {M(pn)} has no terms in [0.5388974..., 1] while for even exponents it does, yet in practice no terms exceed 1-ε for any fixed ε>0 so effectively they can too be said never reach . In contrast though, there exists x≥0 such that any finite number k of operations produce infinitely many distinct x’s. We also provide bounds on these sequences which show for example that if b≥d then for sufficiently large n M(bn)> 0.5 M(bd).\nIn order to achieve this we use p-adic analyticity and adelic methods together and apply them to the problem at hand.",
    "In this work we explore how much simpler models than the winning approaches in ILSVRC-2014 can match thier performance when using better regularization techniques that control the complexity during training as well as at test time. By employing simple dropouts throughout all convolutional layers and introducing novel low/high resolution data augmentation on top we are able to produce state-of-the art results on ImageNet with only eight layers that require at least six times less computations during testing resulting in faster runtime. This simple architecture performs substantially better by achieving Top5 rate around 69% which matches state-of-the-art Deep RNNs trained under similar settings while being much smaller model with fewer parameters. Furthermore, such an approach allows us to easily train large ensemble networks without having to deal with very deep networks during test phase where fast and accurate predictions matter most. We demonstrate our method for producing compact ensembles by presenting three new models trained on ILSVRC-2013 dataset that reach accuracy around 80%.",
    "> Abstract: A new osmotic pressure equation has been derived based on experimental data and theoretical considerations, which improves upon the existing van’t Hoff equation by including an additional term to account for the effect of solute size (molecular weight) in addition to concentration. This new formula was tested experimentally using two different types of solutions with varying concentrations and molecular weights of solutes. It was found that the new formula provides better agreement between predicted and measured values than the van’t Hoff equation, particularly at higher concentrations or larger molecules. These results suggest that this new formula may be useful for predicting osmotic pressures under various conditions where traditional methods fail due to limitations such as high viscosity or non-ideal behavior.",

Our method uses a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from volumetric images, while also using a PointNet++ architecture to process point clouds extracted from these same images. These two feature representations are then combined in a novel way via attention mechanisms inspired by SENet [Hu et al., ICCV17]. This allows our model to leverage information about the spatial structure of objects within the scene as well as their appearance. In addition, we propose a new loss function based on the Dice coefficient that encourages the CNN to learn more discriminative features than traditional cross entropy losses. Experiments show that this combination leads to improved performance over state-of-the-art methods when training with only one or two examples per class.",
    "Authors: Vlada Stavropoulou and Christophe Prieur\nAbstract: We propose an image segmentation framework, taking into account both the intensity features extracted by non-local filtering, as well as the topological information provided by the spatial arrangement of superpixels computed locally in neighbourhoods using topology preservation methods such as Chamfer Distance (CD). Following recent works which have advocated that this additional prior can be useful to alleviate difficulties like occlusions or lighting variations when applied jointly with standard non-supervised density estimation based image clustering algorithms, we use it here within an unsupervised graph partitioning formulation that allows the definition of a large scale number of clusters at various degrees of granularity according to the local size of segments detected. As our proposed model contains only few parameters relative to CD, no optimization procedure is necessary for its fine tuning but one can simply adapt it easily given specific constraints to handle for a particular application with a high level of confidence on the results obtained. This approach has been validated experimentally on different datasets showing good performances.",

This allows us to leverage information about object boundaries during pixel classification, improving performance on both tasks. In addition, our model can be trained end-to-end using only weakly labeled data, making it more scalable than existing methods that require expensive human labeling or additional training steps. Experiments show that CWAE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on several benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes.",

    "\"We present DeepIGeoS (DIPS), a fully automated method for interactive segmentation of 3D medical images (brain MRIs, CTs, and 3D US). DIPs is a fast, accurate, and fully automatic 3D segmentation method that uses a unique and intuitive two-step algorithm. In the first step, the method automatically defines the regions where user interaction is needed. Next, 3D geodesic-based algorithms identify landmarks of the object of interest and then use this information to initialize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment the object within these landmarks. DIPS offers three unique advantages: i) it avoids time-consuming 3D landmarks selection, ii) it overcomes the segmentation challenges in images with large deformations, and iii) it outperforms other automated methods with the same computational complexity. We tested DIPs on 3D ultrasound (3DUS) and 3D CT and MR images of multiple organs (brain, liver, pancreas, uterus) and a large clinical dataset of 954 brain MRI scans.

In this paper, we propose a novel data-swapping method for fast and accurate 3D medical image segmentation. The proposed method consists of two main components: a data-swapping module and a segmentation module. The data-swapping module is used to generate synthetic data by swapping the data from different patients. The segmentation module is used to segment the synthetic data. The proposed method is evaluated on the BraTS 2019 dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a higher Dice score than the state-of-the-art methods.\n\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"Fast and Accurate 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Data-swapping Method\" from arxiv.org:\n\n> Medical image segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis",
    "> Motivated by several problems that arise in the theory of symmetric polynomials and algebraic number theory we study how far functional analogues of Hölder, Minkowski, Markov (or Hardy) or Herglotz–Marcinkiewicz inequalities can be expected to hold. In particular we provide such “best possible” functionals versions of Holder's inequality for finite signed measures on a locally compact abelian group.\n> We find it striking and noteworthy at this stage to describe here briefly what one does when trying to find suitable weight functions for which an extension theorem should fail – as suggested by many examples that have appeared recently - in contrast with the unweighted case treated by our recent results in two previous papers. For general L1 spaces one may need to consider the more restrictive classes defined above. Let us mention further interesting issues coming into play through those questions. A natural approach would consist therefore to look carefully at the behaviour under linear transformations of products of exponentials, given their importance both classical aspects of measure theory discussed above and in analytical number theory, where they are used to prove results concerning multiplicative characteristics and divisibility. For instance let θ ∈ [0,2/3[ be fixed, the set [∊ , 1/∀] U {e− κ i} consists precisely of all values taken on by exp(it log c ) = exp(c t) where p ∈ Primes . This gives rise naturally – if the density of primes goes fast enough towards some value c > 1 − 1 − ε − exp(ct) and then one observes that indeed there exists a linear map X : R → C satisfying this conjecture. On the other hand given any ct>1 it is well known already since Titchmarsh (1947) and later extended by Helson et al. that either such an exponential product fails completely – say t = lim sup n→∞ ln |p_n|, because P.

    "\"Urban scene segmentation is a challenging task particularly because of the presence of occlusions and unforeseen objects. The lack of high-level information such as bounding box labels causes traditional segmentation algorithms to be less accurate. Hence, semi-supervised learning algorithms that can leverage high-level information in low labeled datasets with unlabeled data, such as images and videos, can be advantageous. However, the large amount of unlabeled video segments requires a computationally efficient method for segmentation. We present a segmentation method called Naive-Student based on a semi-supervised learning method (self-training) and a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-101). We propose a method to improve the efficiency of segmentation by increasing the accuracy of the self-training method. The results on the DAVIS benchmark are competitive to other unsupervised learning methods and the ResNet-101 classifier. When labeling is not possible, Naive-Student can be used instead of fully-supervised labels to predict more accurate bounding boxes for the training dataset.\"\nRead the full abstract for free here:",
    "> We consider models that jointly sample sets and labelings, where each element can be uniquely identified within its set. Such models are a generalization of Markov random fields with arbitrary-label nodes to any number of dimensions or latent variables. Using a novel inference algorithm which combines particle filters based on variational free energy minimization and loopy belief propagation (also called message passing), we show how many learning algorithms from neural networks to reinforcement learning can be naturally cast into such a model framework, leading to rich expressive power while circumventing issues like gradient vanishing and exploding gradients that arise otherwise due to loops in the dependency structure. As a demonstrative example we learn models using backpropagation over nonuniform point clouds embedded in Euclidean space by placing multiple discrete class labels at unknown positions, yielding representations invariant across changes in scale.",

    "> We propose a novel framework to learn an edge feature map that can be flexibly incorporated into various fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) through edge attention guidance mechanisms, in order to enhance performance on medical image segmentation tasks. Concretely, we first train our network over generic datasets using multi-scale deep supervision strategies with context encoders such as U-Nets or CSPN to yield a pretrained FCNN base model. Next we modify this base by introducing attentive edge branch layers into it where a convolutional filter bank is employed to generate corresponding edge maps at different scales without losing any spatial information while the rest of weights are updated via gradient backpropagation in a separate parallel manner. Afterwards, the FCNN can integrate these edge features as prior knowledge during training and prediction stages through the so called ET-Attention module. We perform extensive experiments across three major data modalities i.e., MR brain lesion, fundus vessel and optic disc regions under diverse settings on both private benchmark and public challenges dataset and obtained improvements between 0.62% – 15.84%.\n\nAnd now the researcher’s team has released a GitHub repository containing the code needed for reproducing their results.

    "> “An Active Galaxy emits, in addition to ordinary stellar light which it shares with other galaxies like our own Milky Way, unusually strong radiation in a part of electromagnetic spectrum that we call X-rays….Also remarkable are black hole mass estimates...”\n\nSaid another way an AGN has a disproportionately larger proportion of radiators - stars whose energy output exceeds solar levels – than our Galaxy and most every galaxy. A high correlation between supermassive central black holes and these extraordinarily luminous and distant AGNs appears likely, according to NASA astronomers. That means that more mass is converted at higher rates into visible wavelengths where we can see them – gamma rays (including microwave radio), infra-red, visual and ultra violet; but also in X-ray energies. Thus this work proposes an interpretation of the properties exhibited by such AGNs based on its model of dark matter halos around all galaxies including a dense core within the nuclear zone. This core’s gravitational field acceleration causes greater densities in those regions causing higher degrees of internal stress leading to intense thermodynamic heat. Such energy release is then coupled to prodigious particle emissions (mostly photons) at increasingly elevated energetic conditions through successively longer wavelengths towards the far ultraviolet, x ray region of the EM spectrum. It’s believed there are two distinct types of AGNs characterized as Seyfert (or X-ray binary) or quasars (“quasi-stellar objects”) based largely upon their characteristic spectral features observed in various bands along said spectrum. The present day luminosity of type 2 Seyferts appear relatively moderate compared to quasar types, whereas type 1s emit at even lower flux amplitudes. We will compare some simple models used to calculate surface temperature profiles versus known observations regarding color temperature curves and emission characteristics of AGN variants. These models assume a basic spherical symmetry about a point source although one should note that much of what characterizes these objects is inherently asymmetrical if taken in context of the local environs where they reside. Therefore each object possesses a unique set of circumstances that would need careful investigation before drawing any hasty conclusions. Nevertheless, these",
    "> In contrast to the homogeneous case, where an invariant of a Riemannian manifold is determined by its underlying geometry, in the general setting notions of invariants are highly non-unique and not always meaningful. Still, there is a canonical way to construct such invariants, the so-called $S^2$-invariant. Here we present a canonical, geometrically defined, invariant for G_2 manifolds and generalise the construction to the setting of Riemannian manifolds admitting a parallel Clifford multiplication. The corresponding invariant turns out to be equivalent to the so-called G-invariant, which was introduced in 1953 by Berger and O'Neill.\n\nCongratulations to Dmitry Vaintrob and the paper's other authors, including MGK and John Parker.\n\nA couple of points:\n\n- Dmitry Vaintrob has been a long-time reader of this blog (hi, DM), and has helped educate me about G_2 geometry.

    "The widespread deployment of AVs requires that they meet extremely stringent safety standards comparable to those expected in human drivers, yet also scale up across cities around the world. A key tool to ensuring safe driving behavior and evaluate their performance on many different road scenarios would be realistic synthetic test environments. These environments, however, need to offer challenging interactions between AVs and humans; this has driven interest in crowd modeling - using deep neural networks (DNN) trained on existing AV datasets - such as Argoverse for video simulation . However, previous methods cannot generate complex scenes with fine grain level spatial control over objects or even scene layouts, making it particularly difficult to simulate dense crowds or interesting geometries like corners. We propose GEOSIM, an approach for generating geometrically correct synthetic videos that can better capture real traffic rules and more faithfully model rich environmental elements. Specifically for AV scenarios, we make two key contributions: 1) Incorporating detailed local geometry information into our DNN crowd model allows us to generate accurate multi-scale and geometrically consistent predictions for pedestrian trajectories without requiring ground truth labels at every timestep during training, thus enabling large scale training with massive scalability and little data annotation needed; 2) Our proposed end-to-end neural network architecture can produce convincing and diverse synthesized scenes matching user’s specifications about target scenes including number of people, car density/traffic light status etc. Such capability frees up developers' time by automatizing time intensive tasks associated with high quality interactive and visualization tests for selfdriving vehicles.

    "> The field of computer vision and multimedia is on the verge of a revolution. A significant number of applications have adopted deep learning techniques, specifically in the case of convolutional neural networks (CNN), and thus, CNN has revolutionized the area of image and video processing. In this work, we aim to develop a CNN network for real-time instance semantic image segmentation. To achieve this objective, we perform an exhaustive survey of published literature that implements instance semantic image segmentation for all available categories, and then present a novel framework that achieves significant improvements in the state of the art in terms of both performance and speed. Therefore, a novel CNN network called “Real-Time Deep Semantic Image Segmentation Network (RTD-SIS-Net)” that is designed to perform semantic image segmentation and to achieve real-time speed is presented in this study. In RTD-SIS-Net, we propose to use the deconvolutional layers instead of the fully convolution layers of Fully Convolution Networks (FCN) to create dense and precise segmentation maps to provide better quality for semantic image segmentation. In addition, we propose to apply the 1 × 1 and 3 × 3 convolution layers interweaved to significantly increase the quality of the segmentation maps. In addition, the proposed network in this study is more powerful than all existing methods, which results in more efficient utilization of the GPUs to achieve real-time performance. Furthermore, extensive experiments on numerous well-known datasets demonstrate that the proposed CNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for image segmentation.\n\nImage courtesy: Pixabay.",

    "Abstract—The dynamics of drops on solid surfaces was studied by many authors; however, only few studies have been devoted to the case where contact lines move (either due to their own inertia or external driving forces). In this article we study solutions which converge towards certain limit profiles as time tends to plus/minus infinity with asymptotic velocity c1/2 . This problem, also called Cox–Voinov or Hysteresis one [9], has recently received much attention [8,7,5,6]. We propose a regularized version which deals with more general boundary conditions than those considered by previous papers [3] while retaining some key advantages such as simplicity and efficiency – notably at high Reynolds number: since it preserves most known results on sharp drop shape obtained previously without regularisation [3,4], our approach allows us to extend them to broader class of flows and surface forces [10] while solving an important open question raised by [3], namely the existence and uniqueness of solution. Consequently we obtain new results dealing not only with the classical cases but also with contact angles between zero and half-pi. After showing basic properties of the proposed formulation we tackle its well posedness on Sobolev spaces equipped with standard homogeneous norms and complete the numerical experiments conducted in [7]/[2].",

Multi-modal high precision segmentations could help improve clinical decision making and thus patient prognosis. The most existing multi-modality networks cannot precisely predict these shape structures due to lacking of geometry aware mechanisms which may lead to imprecise edges of segment results especially for irregular boundaries while many downstream tasks of CAI need precise edge information such as anatomical surface or soft tissue organ wall borders. In order to achieve accurate prediction on complex contour shapes and obtain well localization along with better global performance, we propose the novel deep neural network named as Psi-net with integrated geometrical feature analysis branch. With end-to-end multi-input fusion scheme, 3D CT/MR images of three typical medical image segmentations of knee menisci extraction, brain white matter segmentation, colon cancer tumor segmentation are incorporated into our proposed framework respectively to provide more abundant supervision information, as well as extracting rich contextual details across data modalities effectively without handcraft features. Our method achieves significantly better overall performance with higher sensitivity, specificity than stateof-the-art approaches and demonstrates strong local spatial and geometric awareness that can outperform standard volume/voxel convolutions on real world multi-target segment tasks.

This setting has been studied extensively under the name “high dimensional linear model” or “sparse linear regression”. In this work we focus on the case where the number of covariates p grows faster than n, and propose a new method to select relevant features based on the rate at which the error probability decays as a function of sample size. Our approach relies on a novel application of the Bonferroni inequality to the Lasso estimator. It yields a simple test statistic whose distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian mixture. Asymptotic results show that our proposed selection rule achieves the minimax optimal rate of convergence over all possible sparsity patterns.

    "> Abstract: In this work, we propose an approach to automatically detect and recognize threats within three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) images in baggage security screening applications. Our proposed method consists of two main steps: threat detection and recognition. For threat detection, we first extract features using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which are then fed into a support vector machine (SVM). We use the SVM classifier to determine whether there exists any threat or not. If no threat is detected, our system will stop at that point; otherwise, it proceeds with the second step, i.e., threat recognition. To perform threat recognition, we employ another CNN model trained on a large dataset containing various types of threats. This CNN model takes as input the extracted feature maps obtained during the previous stage and outputs the probability scores corresponding to each type of threat. Finally, we select the most probable threat based on these scores. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves high accuracy rates for both threat detection and recognition tasks.",

Our results show that the initial growth rate of the PSS depends strongly on the intensity of the incident light field. In addition, we find that the decay kinetics of the PSS can be described by a stretched exponential function which indicates that the relaxation processes involved are not purely diffusive but rather involve some kind of cooperative motion.",

    "Abstract — For closed (possibly non-compact) manifolds, Kronheimer has shown that there exist canonical maps between unreduced Floer homologies with positive spin structure coefficients.

We work over ground fields of characteristic zero. By means of analytic regularizations in infinite dimensions, generalizing the finite dimensional constructions used by Fukaya, Oh, Ohta, Ono and Ruan (2004), we construct a symplectic field theory whose underlying spaces are given just by smooth paths along which the symplectification varies continuously while remaining transverse to itself. Our main result shows that certain reduced versions of these sft’s, when evaluated via Morse theoretically defined spectral action functionals, give rise after applying classical perturbation techniques to natural chain maps induced on sutured handlebody complexes.

The first one is called \"The Prequel\" and takes place in the year 1761 in the fictional town Blackrock; it is told by Peter, who works as an apprentice to a lawyer. The second one is called \"The Story Proper\", and takes place in 1762. In this one, Peter has been living for a year in Blackrock, is about to complete his apprenticeship, and is on the verge of becoming a lawyer.\n\nSounds very interesting. We can easily see through context cues that the author is trying to send a message about slavery through the time periods of his story. After all, it's an American fantasy that takes place mainly in the United States. While some are quick to point out that wikipedia can be written and altered by anyone and has an agenda of its own, I think the fact that the summary exists in a wiki should only count for so much. Why would Wikipedia give a description of a non-existant book? This is the internet we're talking about, and they have been known to fact-check themselves with great vigor.\n\nBut let's look at that description for just a second. \"It is told by Peter...\" \"Peter has been living for a year in Blackrock, is about to complete his apprenticeship, and is on the verge of becoming a lawyer.\" Those aren't just some random words. They're carefully chosen. If you've ever written a book you know exactly what I'm talking about. That paragraph contains not a single word more than what is absolutely necessary, yet it contains information that will tell us a great deal about Peter and how he feels about the world around him.\n\nPeter works as an apprentice, which means that he is probably lower class by modern standards, but may be higher class for his time. Afterwards he becomes a lawyer. The book is set in the south, so this is highly unlikely since women did not become lawyers until well before the book takes place. As a",

    "The story opens in 1937 with Reverend Stephen Kumalo (Stephenson), arriving in Johannesburg to seek his sister Gertrude and his nephew Absalom. He learns that her husband John has died, but does not know where either of them are staying. He then visits Vera Salome who also appears to have no news on the couple's whereabouts even though she was their neighbor at Mbaba-Ha (also known as Kairos City). Kumalo now decides to visit Father Vincent, the assistant manager of Bantu (black people) affairs during apartheid period. Kumaro meets him along with Rev Tshepe, who helps Kumaro locate Mrs Matwiri , the housekeeper Absalom works under when he arrives there, only after asking and waiting for two or three hours. Before leaving Kumaro pays Father his old friend Mr James Jarvis some respects for helping him get back home safely by thanking him and saying goodbyes. Meanwhile he gets upset knowing how bad Jarvis feels about being so cruel over sending away Kumalo who he cared very much like his son . It seems like all hope has been abandoned when suddenly someone tells Kumalo that they think someone has seen his brother 'Absalom' getting arrested while protesting white racism and police brutality outside city hall! In search for more answers about what happened to these loved ones after many failed attempts we meet up later again through this article which explains everything perfectly well enough without revealing anything else spoiler wise.. Although you may already be wondering where absalom lived before moving into the heartless johnnies township area because according to both Kumalos' mother Nongqawuse never let anyone stay overnight if they weren't blood related family. This leads us straight towards finding out why didnt kumalo take any precautions whatsoever against theft especially since it could’ve potentially led absaloms missing person status becoming clearer sooner than expected had anyone stolen something valuable from his house prior too ?

    "> In 1960, Sartre published his last major work, Critique de la raison dialectique (Critique of Dialetical Reason), which was to be the first volume in a projected trilogy on Marxism and history. It was an attempt to reconcile existentialist philosophy with historical materialism by developing a theory of praxis that would explain how individuals could act collectively as a group without losing their individuality or freedom. He argued that human beings are not simply determined by social structures but can transcend them through collective action. However, he also recognized that this process is fraught with contradictions and conflicts between different groups within society.\n\nThe above quote seems to suggest that Sartre's book is about the relationship between individual consciousness and collective consciousness. I am wondering if there is any connection between this idea and the concept of \"collective unconsciousness\"?",
    "> César Cascabel, the novel, is an epistolary novel that deals with the intrigues of the Spanish colonial elite of Venezuela. The novel, written by the Spanish writer Juan Antonio Suárez, tells an incipient romance set in the city of Caracas, the capital of the young Republic of Venezuela. The narrators of the novel are Cesar Cascabel and his two nephews: Carlos Garrastazu and Enrique Garrastazu.\n>\n> The plot and the style of the novel are heavily influenced by the aesthetics of the Belle Epoch, and it parodically refers to the works of the author and painter Joaquín Sorolla, as well as the contemporary Spanish art nouveau movement. The characters, dialogue and events from the novel, are strongly influenced by the cultural and literary movement of the \"Generación del 27\", to which many of Spain's finest writers belonged.\n>\n> The novel was originally conceived as a parody of the literary works of the \"Boom\" movement. Since the first edition, the novel's popularity was high. The success of the novel would later be eclipsed by the works of other notable Spanish writers such as Fernando Fernán Gómez and Juan Benet. Nonetheless, the novel retains its place among the most popularly read novels in Spain, and also features several chapters written in Venezuelan Spanish.\n\nAlthough it says in some sources that the book has been translated to English, I have yet to find an English version for sale anywhere (with the possible exception of Amazon.de, where I presume the book comes with German translation). I am not trying to make any comments about the literary value of the book (though I personally feel that it was a brilliant one and it does deserve an English translation, or at least a release in some other way accessible to an English-speaking audience).\n\nHowever, as I do try to collect as many Spanish-language \"Cesar\" books as possible, even if my collection of \"Cesar\" collections is far from complete, I would like very much to get my hands on this, or, at least, on a translation into some other language, even if only in digital format.

He meets up with his childhood friend Yukari Mishima at the train station, but she seems distant towards him. When he arrives at his house, he finds that his mother has invited her old college friends over for dinner. They are all married couples except one woman, who is divorced. During dinner, they talk about their children and how much they have grown since last year. Afterwards, everyone goes outside to look at the snowfall while drinking hot sake. As they do so, they notice a strange light coming from the forest nearby. Curious, they go into the woods to investigate it. There, they find a mysterious cabin where a group of people dressed like Santa Claus are preparing presents for children around the world. One of them explains that they are elves sent by God to help those in need during this time of year. However, there is also another group called the Grim Reapers who try to stop them from doing good deeds because they believe that humanity should be left alone to suffer on its own. The two groups engage in battle until dawn breaks and both sides retreat back to their respective camps. Meanwhile, Kouichi notices that Yukari has been watching everything from afar without saying anything. Later that night, when everyone else has gone to bed, he asks her what was going on earlier today. She tells him that she had seen something similar before many years ago when she was still living here with her parents. At first, she thought it might have been some kind of dream or hallucination caused by stress due to exams at school; however after talking more about it later on with other classmates who experienced similar things too (including herself), they realized that these events were actually real!",
    "When we think of the Catholic Church, most likely, images of priests and bishops, who are the spiritual leaders of a community of parishioners, come to mind. In the book “The Bishop,” however, Bishop Raymond Bernard, the main protagonist, who has risen to the top of the clerical ladder in the American Catholic Church, is viewed as a “monster” and a “demon.”\n\nThe author, Bernard Malamud, whose short story “The First Seven Years” was the inspiration for one of the episodes of “The Simpsons,” is considered to be a brilliant writer but is unfortunately under-appreciated. In this book, which was published in 1978, Malamud tells the story of one man’s ascent to power in this religious institution as a means of telling more. To say that what we perceive to be good is always good would be folly.\n\nThat bishop, however, makes a terrible mistake, and that “moral” error puts him in a hopeless situation.\n\nAfter leaving Judaism and adopting Catholicism as his religious belief system, the future bishop, Father Bernard, is an ambitious young man who is a part of the process of becoming ordained as a priest. He is not an ordinary man in any way, in fact, despite his flimsy exterior of devotion to the Church and his willingness to follow orders, his thoughts and actions belie a much more complex personality that is constantly working to make its way to the surface. He is a complex individual whose many layers cannot be fully understood by society.\n\nWhen he arrives in the small town, he comes into contact with a woman (the wife of the church maintenance guy) with whom he shares an undeniable attraction, and his attempts to hide this attraction are doomed from the very start. Bishop Raymond Bernard cannot keep this woman — who becomes a symbol of his longings and failures — at a distance.\n\nThe bishop comes into contact with the woman after he has reached the top of his career. The woman takes the opportunity to become more intimate with the bishop, and she seduces him while he is in the throes of a religious breakdown.\n\nAfter a religious breakdown caused by his attempts to maintain an orderly life, Bernard",

    "The story centers on a man who wakes up in his apartment with total amnesia about what has happened and what he is doing there, but he notices that there are strange symbols all over the place in it - strange glyphs which turn out to be ancient Arabic words referring to mysticism - magic, black arts. He can't remember anything except when he is going downstairs in rush hour traffic - but his car's engine doesn't work right or well so his first thought goes towards getting that fixed - he then remembers something about a letter where someone had talked how he shouldn't do whatever 'it' (whatever) was...and some name. This man gets into physical conflicts/fights with just about anyone because he will forget where they came from (the attacks). At one point, after escaping an attack & being shot at by these men wearing special masks while investigating this symbol stuff - he winds up fleeing to Mexico & finds out that everyone knows him & calls him by different names including \"The Greatest Wizard In All The World\". After being interrogated at gunpoint by several officials, Mexican army soldiers come asking questions as well so this guy figures out that some type of mission assignment must have been given to do something important; find someone etc.. One night someone asks if any of you guys want me - take your time now! And soon enough more than half their group shows up including two women dressed like virgins waiting around ready when called upon by another one saying We Are Here For Service!!! Now comes part three : When A Man Gives Up Control Over Everyone Else It Can Become Your Destiny. From here everything changes again; suddenly many other people start appearing along side each other - strangers who seem friendly talking freely among themselves speaking Spanish-like language...with certain key phrases repeated every couple seconds which sound almost melodically beautiful yet confusing too - especially when trying translate them literally word by word . Finally we follow our hero all way back home ending finally being reunited only this time realizing why those few minutes before having become completely confused became necessary since everything seemed exactly alike once again until then.\"",

This race's technology includes teleportation beacons, which make travel across the planet instantaneous; however, use of these devices comes with great risk due to their unpredictability regarding possible destination of arrival. There exists much religious and political tension between multiple factions – including the Tamarine Empire, who have been struggling against tyranny at home while maintaining trade routes overseas despite this trouble. Also present is the Kishane Clan, whose influence in both politics and commerce has allowed them access that is normally prohibited for all non-Tamarians. They are one element of a complex system of power that controls the majority of government affairs. One faction that opposes such oppression is known as the Mordensham Rebellion led by Rianon, a popular figure among the people whose name represents the goal of freedom.^{[8]}\n\nThe idea seemed absurd... until I realized it had already happened in the real world once, even if no book ever documented those events on paper or digital media — even though many were left to wonder how something of its kind could occur, especially given our own perception of civilization itself.

    "> A novel that includes the line \"Terry Pratchett is a British author of comic fantasy novels\" is a bit of an oddity. One of the reasons why this is so is that the genre in which he works is known for being relatively free of humor. Terry Pratchett is known for poking fun at everything ranging from the most trivial to the most serious. At times he can make fun even of himself (as can be seen in \"Nation\").\n>\n> In \"Babe & Me\" Pratchett is having fun with an interesting topic. While the setting is the near-future, in most respects the book could be read as science fiction or as hard science fiction. The action takes place in an abandoned shopping mall. The central character is the 16-year old Babe Chet, a girl who had an unusual childhood. Although her father is the chairman of the biggest, richest and most powerful company in the world, Babe had little or no association to the company world until a few months before beginning this book. Her step-mom had raised her, teaching her that she needs to be self-sufficient. As a kid Babe had some friends who have been working for her father, and Babe had access to some facilities on the company grounds (such as the company's small zoo, or the golf-course). But she grew up to prefer playing computer games in a \"cyber-bar\".\n>\n> It is thus no wonder that after the age of 13 Pratchett's heroine is in need of help. She is \"too bright\" to become a full-time receptionist (what other job can one get in a mall) but too inexperienced to be useful. She needs work but she can't concentrate, needs to be around people but she doesn't know how, and most of all, she needs to know what to believe. When a job offer comes from the abandoned mall, it is too tempting to refuse, and the girl becomes an assistant to a guy who calls himself Me. Since he cannot recall who it was that asked him to do the work, he uses the label \"Babe & Me\", and that became the title of the book.\n>\n> While",

One man is Jewish, while the other is German; both have been persecuted by the Nazis. They meet on board an ocean liner bound for America, where they hope to start new lives free from oppression. However, their journey is not without its challenges – they must contend with anti-Semitism and racism as well as the dangers posed by war itself. Along the way, they form unlikely friendships that help them survive this dark time in history. Ultimately, these two very different individuals learn how much they can rely upon each other when faced with adversity.",
    "> In 1920s Egypt, Taita, an old Nubian man who has lived through many wars and revolutions, tells his story to a young Englishman named Amar. He begins with his childhood in ancient Kush (modern-day Sudan), where he was born into slavery but eventually became a priest. After being captured by the Egyptian army during one of their campaigns against the Kushites, he becomes a slave again, this time to a wealthy family in Memphis. There he meets the beautiful Sekhet, daughter of the house, whom he falls deeply in love with. However, she is promised to another man, so they can only meet secretly at night. When her father discovers them together, he sells both of them as slaves to a merchant ship bound for Rome. On board, Taita saves Sekhet's life when she nearly drowns after falling overboard; however, she dies soon afterwards due to complications from childbirth.\n>\n> Years later, Taita returns to Egypt as a free man, having been freed by the Roman Emperor Augustus himself. He settles down on the banks of the River Nile near Aswan, where he builds a temple dedicated to Isis. Here he lives out the rest of his days, until he is killed by bandits while trying to save some children from being kidnapped. His body is found by Amar, who buries him next to Sekhet's grave.",

If, for instance, you have to rely on a single sentence to tell you how a protagonist is characterized (she's a \"poor little bitch girl\"), you've really failed in the basics of storytelling. And if, for added inappropriateness, you then go and use that same sentence as part of the book's title, then you've really fucked up.\n\nSome questions: is the book by an author of a different nationality, written in the U.S., or is it a book by an English-speaking author set outside the country?\n\nIn any case, the summary is a real stinker.",

He reached the fourth round for the first time since he won his second Melbourne Park title as a wild card last year and beat Tomic last week to become the oldest man into a major semi-final since Boris Becker, then just 24, was knocked into the final by Jim Courier at Flushing Meadows in 1993. The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion is also struggling with a left shoulder injury but did not go undergo any operations when off court over the summer.\n\nThat match would have pitted Nadal against an opponent who has already beaten him this season -- the unseeded American Sam Querrey defeated the defending champion earlier this month in Acapulco.

Despite its strong start, Canada never could recover. \"He made it incredibly tough\".

    "Eight to 10 million Asian workers face losing their textiles and clothing jobs by about 2035 as rising incomes force people to buy less for cheaper prices, says an Oxfam-commissioned study [Bernard Hagen]. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n\nAsian countries will struggle to compete with cheap labour costs elsewhere and are dependent on export markets that may collapse when developed economies improve, it adds. It's also argued that there should be more protection mechanisms established internationally whereby developing nations can stop foreign imports if they have been dumped. But developing countries need the West's market to generate export earnings while developed country consumers need imports from emerging markets such as Bangladesh. This makes both parties vulnerable, claims the report released ahead of next week's UN climate summit in South Africa.\n\nDeveloped countries say protecting domestic producers with trade barriers would harm poorer trading partners. Developing countries argue that allowing cheap Chinese goods into Western markets has caused some manufacturing to be outsourced leading to job losses among low skilled labourers in advanced industrialised countries. According Xenia Scheil-Adlung writing in EurActiv, \"The rise of new economic powers like India and China... could eventually lead developing countries that provide these services - especially low-income ones - in direct competition among themselves\" says Ms Steuerlein, director at IWE.\"If we assume a continuous devalorisation trend which favours rich countries, we could imagine this kind of dynamic playing out,\" according to Ms Scheil-Adlung quoting Mr Gros from Bruegel.",
    "Draft rules allowing businesses to protect some computer programs as patents have been postponed by the European Commission. It has given itself more time to consider whether the directive may give software giants Microsoft and Sun Microsystems too much control over technology used by competitors, and stifle innovation. Computer companies and universities had warned that giving firms this scope would lead their technologies being developed for cash rather than new ideas or progress.\"The decision reflects our continuing concern and determination to get this right. I now hope there will be an early agreement between member states on where to go next,\" UK trade minister Gerry Sutcliffe said in response to the delay. Software currently cannot normally benefit from laws which permit individuals and companies to stop rivals copying inventions for at least 20 years after it was first applied for a trademark. Instead copyright protection covers ideas stored in electronic format such as source code and manuals if they are the authors own original work - but not ideas of operation or function. Such issues could be resolved with the adoption of a draft Directive published last December which aimed to provide clearer guidelines about when computers innovations can also become legally protected trade secrets which can fetch considerable compensation in courts should rival products infringe those rights. As well as helping to boost business confidence there are fears that without these legal means to ensure some return from inventors who spend millions researching solutions then Europe's competitiveness at attracting start-up funds may suffer. However the current debate surrounds fears Microsoft dominates the server market because Windows runs all client systems, and its software licensing terms gives other companies no flexibility whatsoever to develop alternative hardware or operating system interoperability standards unless it first seeks and receives permission to do so.. Its stance echoes similar complaints laid at Intel for refusing to make available chip designs necessary to allow others create compatible processors outside its control. But while a small number of experts agree software patents might harm European software developers chances of staying competitive the majority strongly disagree. This includes many organisations ranging from large research foundations such as IBM and Hewlett Packard through universities, schools, governments agencies and non-profit bodies - including thousands of scientists, teachers and researchers - plus almost every standard setting body and professional organisation - that say the proposed legislation does nothing for them yet potentially risks damaging hundreds of jobs with little gain possible for",

The decision followed complaints from the parents of two children aged 3 and 15 years old and upheld their initial formal complaint made to Ofcom over what they considered it shown on Nickelodeon which had breached the Broadcast Code under BSC Article Rules 2.4(iii) and (iv).\n\nThe programme shows included a scene where Patrick Star jets out of a bubble through a door in his pants with his lower buttocks exposed. Complainants argued such images were totally unsuitable viewing for young audiences, particularly as no warning screen appeared prior this being shown. They considered Nickelodeon should be reprimanded given its status within British media as being mainly aimed at kids who often have limited access to other channels. A representative for Ofcom said an investigation was ongoing but the company has now reached a confidential settlement agreement, paying off those complainant families. However, the judgement still stands meaning other broadcasters are warned on not only having similar adult-orientated scenes featured in supposed family entertainment programmes, especially when shown around peak hours or prewatershed as well as during school holidays and not giving any warnings beforehand for any explicit material contained.\n\nA spokesman for Viacom told BBC News that the firm accepted there may have been a risk of upsetting certain audience members by letting them know about future episodes featuring some more mature elements and regretted that situation occurring so thank people affected.

He is the most successful British singles player of the last 20 years.\n\nIn the four events he has played in 2007, he has won four rubbers.\n\nThe 15th highest ranked player in the world, Henman says he will continue to play singles tournaments though and remains hopeful of retaining his place in the world's top 20.\n\n\"With the Davis Cup tie this weekend I hope it will give me that added motivation to do well and continue the good run of results I've had this year,\" he added.\n\nTeam-mates Andy Murray and Anthony Ross both felt Henman's decision would be a huge loss to the team.\n\nRoss was quoted in the British press as saying: \"We think a lot of him, a lot of the team do. It is a big loss, he is a winner - that's not going to change.\"\n\nThe doubles specialist has an excellent record as a team player - he beat Australia to take Britain into the 2005 World Group play-offs and has been in the world's top 30 for most of his career.\n\nMurray has previously said he was shocked at Henman's apparent willingness to step down.\n\nThe 19-year-old has been impressed with Henman's professionalism and ability to perform at a key time of week.

It suggests games should be used for both enrichment and instruction, and that pupils from three years old and up could be introduced. It also says the importance of games in education should be further investigated.\n\nIn its report, entitled Video Games and Technology in Education, LTS says that games could be played at home and in class, and that game playing in schools should form part of \"a broader process of pupil development\". \"We consider that games can be of benefit for teaching the basic skills of early literacy and numeracy, for enriching a wide variety of classroom activities and for extending learning beyond the classroom and even beyond the school,\" says the report. \"These are exciting opportunities, but we have also noted that the benefits may be undermined if the teacher is not well versed in how the technology works in practice.\"\n\nThe Scottish Government has not yet reacted to the report, but a previous response on the matter said that a full report would be submitted soon. LTS has made 25 recommendations to support the use of video games in learning. They include: Investigate and trial the use of console and online games to \"enhance and extend\" the learning experience Encourage schools to set up gaming networks, clubs and events and also engage with the games industry Support and promote the use of games in schools by teachers and pupils, and create a \"body of knowledge\" about their use in education. The games industry has welcomed the report. \"When used effectively digital games can do more to engage children with learning than almost any other medium,\" said Mike Rawlins, managing director of TIGA, which represents the UK games community. The industry body said",
    "> A Polish band has released an album on Nintendo's popular handheld games console, the Game Boy.\n>\n> The group, called BlipPop, have recorded 12 tracks using only sounds generated by the machine itself.\n>\n> They say they wanted to show that music can be made without expensive equipment and software.\n>\n> Their debut CD, entitled BlipPop, was launched at a concert in Warsaw last week.\n>\n> It features songs such as I Love You, which uses the sound of a heartbeat, and Bubblegum, which mimics the popping of bubble gum.\n>\n> Band member Piotr Kurek said he had been inspired after seeing a Japanese musician perform on a similar device.\n>\n> He told BBC News Online: \"I thought it would be interesting if we could make some kind of music with this thing.\"\n>\n> Mr Kurek says the band spent about six months experimenting before coming up with their final track list.\n>\n> \"We tried many different things,\" he explained. \"Some were very simple - like just pressing buttons or blowing into the microphone. Others were more complicated, involving several people playing together.\"\n>\n> The band members are all students at Poland's Academy of Music in Katowice.\n>\n> Mr Kurek added: \"It took us quite a long time because there aren't any special tools for making music on the Game Boy. We used our own ideas and imagination.\"\n>\n> The band hope to release another album later this year.",

    "A crisis lies ahead for many research areas traditionally found within universities' humanities and social science departments, an advisory body has warned. Universities UK (UUK) says there are some subjects where jobs for academics could disappear unless they change course to become more relevant. They have urged department heads at these institutions to start making changes now or face the consequence later on, when there are fewer places available and no one wants the job of teaching it because the pay wasn't enough and nobody else was interested. In January this year UUK published a report into postgraduate study trends over recent decades, suggesting that there were only ten degrees that had enjoyed increases in their student intake between 1980/81 to 2006/07. All others saw falling numbers - including drops across all areas previously grouped together under arts & humanities. UUK deputy chief executive Nicola Dandridge said at the time that 'we need to ask ourselves very serious questions about what is going wrong'. Now, a working party has examined six subject groups to see whether problems lay with poor recruitment strategies or if there was something inherent within them which makes people naturally uninterested. It included experts from UUK itself, HEFCE and SAVI, plus vice chancellors from around the country. Areas covered by the review include:\n- modern languages, and especially those taught via immersion methods;\n- British Studies / Area studies other than international relations, Chinese or Russian* ;\n- Economics**\n- Sociology;\n- Politics and History*** And three themes were identified as common across several subjects:\n- Increasingly specialist content means people lose interest quickly ;\nTeaching becomes outdated due to lack of relevance – often because subject itself remains same but world changes rapidly ; Most students don’t want to do a PhD and academic jobs are still too low paid – plus new regulations won’t even allow most staff members to take temporary positions abroad without first returning home and getting hired again . So what? First, if these issues exist then the chances are they will endure and get worse given how entrenched they appear now already! Second, since some degree courses require teachers who specialize mainly outside university surroundings instead only inside classrooms themselves*, perhaps we should consider removing any funding incentives given",

When Joseph arrived at his work-place he informed all who wanted to know why he would not be coming on time – that in accordance with the scripture, his espoused wife Mary was about to present herself to her relatives in Nazareth for purification after childbirth. He left her guarded by other women until time came to set out on the journey. Then both together went to Bethlehem – neither expecting what lay before them – each going simply through routine preparations of the festivities which are planned when preparing such occasions.\nNow Mary carried her child safely with care but she felt his weight upon her body pressing down constantly against hers like leaden bricks placed heavily within iron bars!

    "> Marriage, like death, is an institution that has been around for so long it's hard to imagine life without it. But what exactly does marriage mean? Is it just a legal contract between two people or something more? In this blog post we will explore the meaning and history of marriage as well as some interesting facts about weddings!\n\n## What Does It Mean To Be Married?\n\nThe word “marriage” comes from the Latin root maritus which means husband or wife. So when you get married, you are essentially becoming one with your spouse in both body and spirit. This union can be seen as either sacred (as in religious ceremonies) or secular depending on how you view it. Either way though there’s no denying that getting hitched changes everything – including taxes!\n\nIn most countries today couples must obtain permission before they can legally tie the knot but historically speaking things weren’t always so formalized…\n\n### History Of Wedding Ceremonies And Traditions Around The World\n\nWeddings have existed since ancient times although their exact origins remain unknown due largely because many cultures didn’t keep written records back then. However archaeological evidence suggests that early humans may have celebrated nuptials using symbols such as fire rituals where flames were used symbolize purification while water represented fertility among other things. Over time these traditions evolved into elaborate ceremonies involving multiple days filled with feasting music dancing etcetera all designed to bring good fortune upon newlyweds who would often receive gifts during these festivities too!\n\nToday wedding customs vary greatly across different regions even within individual nations themselves making each event unique unto itself regardless whether its held indoors outdoors under tents pavilions churches synagogues mosques temples pagodas castles palaces mansions estates villas cabins yurts teepees tipis igloos huts shacks barns sheds garages basements attics closets bedrooms living rooms kitchens dining rooms bathrooms gardens patios balconies rooftops decks porches lawns fields forests deserts oceans lakes rivers streams creeks brooks ponds pools fountains springs swamps marshes bogs wetlands jungles savannahs grasslands plains mountains valle",

    "Weddings are for wedded couples - not yet me But that day soon will be when love blooms in my spirit and I too can say, I do. In the meantime life continues to go on For others and for me And as we all know it's better being alone than sorry.\nThe young man was born with multiple challenges including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy. He never spoke but has used an assistive device over the past three years along with eye-gaze technology which allows him to type what he wants. At age 17 his parents decided they were ready to give up caring responsibility so he moved into group accommodation at Newport House, South Australia. It’s here where he met Miss Rosemary Jones who also lives there with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). They became close friends quickly fell together. When she left Newport shortly afterwards, they continued meeting twice weekly until last year when their friendship grew into what his mother describes as “a deep and loving relationship.”\nThey recently returned from a five night, 40th birthday holiday for Amanda – Rosey’s carer – to Hamilton Island during which Adam announced that although this had always been his dream girl since childhood (and not vice versa!), if anyone could ever make him move beyond silence, she would!! So there it began; planning a wedding took place right away between our household where live-in care supports Adam…(because that’s how serious these two lovely people were about each other.)\nAdam and Rosey got married on Saturday July 28 – one month after receiving news of approval by DHS State government department managing adults under guardianship orders – allowing them both freedom without having separate home care support packages needed due to needing different needs.\nI am the person who did a video blog a few months back asking why no ASD adult woman featured on Married At First Sight or any channel. We asked why because this is something real, honest & personal rather than fabricated contrived scenes designed just ‘for ratings?’.

The most significant distortion in this regard has been the view of Hinduism that underlies much of the New Age as \"essentially spiritual\" because it rejects notions of deity -- or of heaven and hell. Indeed, when I first attended meetings of the Integral Yoga Institute, many years ago, the most commonly used phrase was something like this: \"The purpose of yoga is to experience a personal God or a cosmic experience of universal consciousness.\"\n\n\"The fact that this view leaves no room for bhakti-yoga (",
    "THE POETRY OF LIFE by Henry Havelock Ellis, 1859 – 1939\n\nIn a little garden by the sea A flower grew and blossomed fair; Sweetly through long evenings did it sing And I heard its music there.\nFor every life like mine that passed Along the road called happiness Its fragrance came to warm my heart With sweetness unlikeness to all else; Each night as sunset came in view At dawn again did starlets shine, It smiled at me and bade me stay Close to the threshold of our birth. For this was just an epitome Of what for us were written here, This world and those which soon we'll find Are part alike of reality– One but shadowed and the other clear. Yet ever shall these voices keep Their own strange echoes in each mind, Eternity has not yet come To sever us apart we think; We live forever hand-in-hand With love abiding one with one In endless joy beyond time's reach Of grief or pain or change of thought. Through earth and heaven, through sunshine and rain– Our lives entwined–we walk along",
    "I. THE SCENE AT NEW ORLEANS\nIt was 4 o'clock on Christmas afternoon, and in New Orleans there passed in the space of three hours or less something which shall be remembered both here after, as well as elsewhere among those who had any part to play in what ensued—something unique upon this continent; for if it came with a touch of sorrow, yet its tone was far too strong for regret. From all the world about were called together that day men of good heart, good will, good faith and purpose to do that which they deemed best might help alleviate an unmerited wrong—an evil born perhaps of ignorance and misunderstanding only, but one by the people of this country sanctioned for years until through pitying hearts the voice began rising up high in a protest against such treatment; against slavery itself—a thing so very horrible in the light of our Christian civilization. The object was not immediately achieved which we are now commemorating at these very moments for another century must pass away before we may hope to see accomplished anything like complete social freedom throughout America; but then as an advance we have reason to rejoice that man has come even the first few steps onward towards his goal along a higher road of being than he trod in former times. And in recapitulating in brief what happened during those three memorable Christmas hours let us begin at its beginning; and the real starting place lies on the railroads somewhere between Chicago and New York where hundreds of human beings met every year en route East and West—traders and bankers coming home to their families around the fireside, farmers bringing crops back to market, missionaries seeking converts to Christ on some dark Indian soil in Oklahoma, merchants journeying forth to visit the homes where once lived many friends while new associates await them over sea. Yes, on that great track, stretched out across the broad expanses that lie Northwards and Southwards, they poured, these thousands of folk going East and West. Whoever knew it, however? Who ever dreamt that hidden behind a mask no mortal eye could pierce, lay concealed two mighty rivers of blood gushing down to wasteful ruin? One stream flowed eastward from Mississippi plantations into a river crowded with boats headed toward Natchez; down to Louisiana and on beyond to",
    "\"Endymion A Poetic Romance\"\n\nby John Keats\n\nI\n\nA thing of beauty is a joy for ever:\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\nPass into nothingness; but still will keep\nA bower quiet for us, and a sleep\nFull of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.\nTherefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing\nA flowery band to bind us to the earth,\nSpite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth\nOf noble natures, of the gloomy days,\nOf all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways\nMade for our searching: yes, in spite of all,\nSome shape of beauty moves away the pall\nFrom our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,\nTrees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\nFor simple sheep; and such are daffodils\nWith the green world they live in; and clear rills\nThat for themselves a cooling covert make\n'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,\nRich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\nAnd such too is the grandeur of the dooms\nWe have imagined for the mighty dead;\nAll lovely tales that we have heard or read:\nAn endless fountain of immortal drink,\nPouring unto us from the heaven's brink.\n\nII\n\nNow more than ever seems it rich to die,\nTo cease upon the midnight with no pain,\nWhile thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad\nIn such an ecstasy! While I am borne\nCareless, like a dragon-fly, upon the breeze,\nThrough the blue sky, among the fields, the beechen trees,\nAnd with the butterflies, O, with the butterflies,\nO, with the butterflies!\n\nIII\n\nThe poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\nDoth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet's pen\nTurn",

There were new things coming every week,\nNew books came out with covers covered by blotches;\nMy friends told me but I couldn't take it in for a tick...",
    "Once there were two lovers, both lovers wild and young. But there is a rule on this planet: every night, before midnight, each soul must sleep, and each must sleep alone, even though they want to sleep with someone else. The only rule the two lovers had was: they'd be together again at dawn, and hold each other tight, all night. And because it was dark they couldn't see the others flaws.\n\nBut just after midnight dawned the lovers apart. Then it was time to sleep, but this night the lovers could not! Both lay alone, and longed, and could neither eat nor sleep and they could not be satisfied with nothing else to do but pine. The next day the lovers had to play all alone and pretend all was good in their hearts; it was only because of the rules they hated to hurt each other to death. And so every night went on like this until the time passed when neither one could tell whether it was day or night. They just wanted every day and every night to end.\n\nThe lovers then came up with a simple plan to stop the pain with a kiss and be together forever.\n\nNow there's a curse laid on this planet by one of its Gods. The God is jealous and the ruler is the sun and he does not care if his lovers die from loneliness and despair and want. But the Sun would rather the lovers be with him forever so he placed a spell and every time a lovers' lips touch; they fuse into the sun and he has a new lover, every night.",
    "> A letter written for my daughter, to a lady who had presented her with a cap:\n>\n> Madam,\n>\n> Being one of many gentlemen who are in love with your lovely daughter, I do not know but that you may expect this from me; who am neither her father, nor the husband whom she will certainly marry. To my disgrace I confess that the reason I take up your time with this epistle is on the pretext of thanking you for the cap you had the goodness to give my adorable daughter, the prettiest thing she has or ever will possess. To be frank, I am sorry that I found it out before she did, for I would rather that she should be made happy by that surprise without knowing that I was party to it. And I am afraid that from now on until the marriage ceremony that may unite us, I will never be able to be surprised by anything that can happen to us. For as one who has already enjoyed the sweet delight that love brings, I think that is it impossible to discover a new pleasure.\n>\n> But here is what I will promise. As far as my happiness is concerned, and as far as your daughter is concerned, believe me: it is very great and unending. However, I beg you to help me. Do not let me see any letters between her and me while under your surveillance, lest by being seen I lose the pleasure of reading them.\n>\n>\n>\n> This said, here are my tears, soaked on both sides of the paper.

As they drop bombs through their dark skies and rain down napalm on their heads. As they bang up kids in cages, make widows out of wives and orphans out of lives. But somewhere between Iraq and Syria I doubt that any sane man really knows anymore What makes us want to bomb some other far flung shithole When it could just as easily be our own. Or maybe we just feel we need the land to build some fancy malls with luxury stores on sale. To buy more gadgets and bigger yachts with all the money we save By taking some place's oil and forcing all those poor sods Into paying higher prices here at home. And then there is the endless war machine That needs to keep moving forward. After all these years it would be rather hard Not even when you take into account All lives lost over many lands. All the people left without arms, Without legs or homes, without schools or jobs With little hope and less humanity. After two centuries how can we call this freedom From tyranny? Our very own democracy, built by slave labor Still has slavery in many forms today. Perhaps it was never truly about freedom To begin with....\n> Maybe it's easier to believe that we have been lied to. So that we no longer know what to think. We can always go along with whatever someone tells us Is good for everyone. Why should we question why 20% Of us now live below poverty line.

    "Ingredients:\n\n- 1 cup white sugar\n- 1 cup heavy cream\n- 1 cup milk\n- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 4 egg yolks\n- 4 egg whites\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\n2. In a medium saucepan, melt the sugar over medium heat. When the sugar begins to brown, stir it constantly with a wooden spoon until it is a dark amber color. Remove from heat, and stir in the cream and milk. Return to heat, and stir until the caramel is dissolved. Remove from heat, and stir in the vanilla.\n3. In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks until light. Gradually beat in the hot caramel mixture. Pour the mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish.\n4. In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the custard mixture. Pour the mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the baking dish in a larger baking pan. Fill the larger pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the baking dish.\n5. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the custard is set. Remove from oven, and cool. Chill before serving.\n\nThe recipe is attributed to Julia Child, the famous American chef and television personality.\n\nThe recipe is a classic example of a \"caramel custard,\" a dessert that is popular in many countries around the world. The dish is made by combining caramelized sugar with milk, cream, and eggs, and then baking the mixture in the oven. The result is a rich, creamy dessert with a caramelized crust on top.\n\nThe recipe is relatively simple to make, but it does require some care and attention to detail. The most important step is to make sure that the caramel is cooked to the right color and consistency before adding the milk and cream. If the caramel is too dark or too thick, it can make the custard bitter or grainy.",

She tries to emulate his spirit while keeping it healthier by serving a low fat version made with reduced sodium canned tomatoes and nonfat cottage cheese instead of whole milk mozzarella cheeses. In the end notes you learn this recipe isnât for beginners since the first time writer Sarah makes it took two hours versus the forty five minute prep window advertised in the listing. It seems that using fewer or thinner layers would have helped decrease preparation times, especially given how the thin noodle easily dries up if not placed under warm water prior to use.",

As my friend Dara pointed out when she sent me the link: \"I don't understand what makes this blog-worthy.\" We agree entirely about its blogworthiness, but we would add that the recipe is pretty great. It leaves lots up to the chef's personal taste and imagination; there are so many things one could do with these instructions. For example, one may choose: (a) whether to use lean or extra-lean ground beef or, perhaps more healthfully, choose to substitute something else altogether such as chicken, vegetable or nut loaf or maybe even oatmeal. Or perhaps no meat at all? If not meat, then consider substituting scrambled eggs or egg beaters (if this should suit your fancy). How about spices? Does one wish to garnish with salt and pepper shakers or a dash of sea salt crystals? Sour cream or guacamole is always good - why not throw some on top too? Let's see...hmmm....what else might work nicely? Maybe some broccoli, spinach & mushroom combo in a casserole style arrangement underneath our tasty breakfast treat OR how about serving alongside two slices warm toast? Mouth watering yet? All right!!! Let's think outside our comfort zone because when the morning comes and goes and you have woken up late feeling hungry or tired then go over board with whatever combination sounds best after giving careful consideration using fresh ingredients that were carefully chosen at",

Ladle 3 tablespoons batter onto heated skillet then swirl it to completely cover bottom (refrain adding more batter as this can cause holes or make them too thick!) Let brown without lifting/ turning for about 45 seconds before flip. Cook other side for another 30 seconds till golden then remove to plate. Repeat with remaining batter for total of 8 rounds about 6 inches each round. Stack on clean plate when done and keep hot under foil while you prepare filling.\n- Fill center part of each half circle using cream cheese spread mixture, place cube blue cheese inside, roll up tightly into small cylinder shapes by holding one end closed using fork tines so that sauce does not spill out during baking but allow some steam escape (I use tongs instead).

    "> 1. Prepare the dough as you normally would on a typical Saturday morning but let it sit in the fridge with an added egg yolk to keep it moist during cooking. As you get ready, pour about three pounds of hot tea onto your favorite baking sheet (a larger size will make this preparation easier). This should keep warm until all ingredients are assembled, then stir occasionally to incorporate loose bits into liquid as they soften and become more pliable. Set aside three tablespoons or so to use later; we like using unsweetened blackberry jam, raspberry buttercream made especially by us at home just before serving time every week! It gives this recipe its distinct flavor profile while adding moisture without sacrificing sweetness - perfect for breakfast! If not in season please see our suggestion below.. For now cover them up completely so they cool down slowly—this way their insides retain maximum flavor after being reheated again later because sometimes life wants us too cold-blooded instead of lukewarm!

    "Tart and luscious, this lemon curd ice cream tastes more like frozen custard than anything else. Lemon zest added to the mixture produces an aroma that will have people raving about your ability when you serve it up in fancy dessert glasses or dishes.\nGive as many lemons you can get! In fact if its Christmas time buy a cratefull of Eurekas! They're less expensive (often half price) but just so sweet & fragrant; then use them for any & ALL recipes calling for lemon juice during the holiday season, & freeze the rest! When you feel they may be going bad stick 'em outside, or if freezing temps aren't expected leave out in refrigerator with cut side down inside paper bag at room temp.: This really brings out their best flavor & helps preserve quality. You need not wash off the oil/zest coating afterwards either - just run knife thru peel along contours. If using other brand be sure skin isn't waxed over or prepackaged plastic-wrapped(unless you plan on peeling them), also wash well under cold running water right before proceeding because some brands may still have small amounts residual pesticides remaining after being washed by machine instead; even though there has been much speculation otherwise don’t take chances!!

    "## 10 Points about Moving to Another Country (USA - Canada)\n\nI can hear the crickets, and the tumbleweed is blowing past. Here goes.\n\n1. I'm originally from Canada and moved to the US in 1994. I just moved back again in 2014.\n\n2. I moved to a large city for a promotion from a smaller city in 1994. I was going to be with the company for a long, long time until my last boss had a falling out with another company and they moved to Canada and took their work (and the company I worked for) overseas. My promotion went away.\n\n3. In 1998, I was laid off from this company. I spent the next 16 years freelancing in the US and Canada.\n\n4. I recently married a woman in the US and I went to great lengths, including giving up Canadian citizenship while keeping US citizenship, to move her (and my mother-in-law) to Canada with me. No chance of that.\n\n5. I am getting a divorce here in Canada and will soon (within the next 4 years) be a divorced ex-pat. I am moving back to the US. By myself.\n\n6. I will be moving from a city of 700,000 in the US to a city of 2 million in Canada.\n\n7. I will be moving to an area where I know no one; I have very few friends in Canada (and none of whom will be moving from Canada to the US). I have made very good friends through my career (in Canada and elsewhere) and there is a high probability that I won't hear from them again.\n\n8. I will have to get a new career. I won't have to start from scratch completely, but I will have to get another position with another company. In a smaller city.\n\n9. My move is going to be much larger than a normal move from my last house to my new one, although I'm getting rid of almost all my crap (in fact, I have donated and thrown out enough stuff to nearly fill my two storage units in Canada; stuff I moved to Canada 1",
    "\"I know this will probably sound very silly so please if you can just read it and give an answer that would help me out, I appreciate all your input.\"\nA week ago I ended up meeting my boyfriend on his facebook account. I was completely taken back by our past, how he changed dramatically over time even though we where friends for quite a few years beforehand. There has been quite a few times I wanted to get together but he never seemed to want anything more than friendship which isn't fair considering how close friends we are/were. Even while dating other people (which includes some of mutual female acquaintances.) But I am always left feeling like there could be something more between us, although we are both dating now or even single at points we still see each other hang out around in groups or individually. And I tend to think too much. He also comes off as having very little interest in anyone sexually except myself and one of his best friends who died recently. Anyways what can I do? Should I stop getting involved for my own sanity until I find someone else maybe? Although I did go on 3 dates recently after going through a breakup. None have panned into second date situations since then I guess because I didn't want them to but idk. This might not make any sense being written down right now I'm rather nervous haha... If anyone responds im sure I wont come over here again though, i hate making public personal issues.",
    "> I've been interested in reading more books about things that would probably be considered sociology, but since my college was crap and didn't offer many related classes (even though it did have the largest Sociology department)...I pretty much had no idea where to begin besides skimming Wikipedia and looking around Amazon until my eyes bleed or give up hope. So, anyway; does anyone here know any good authors (of either fiction/non-fiction variety) who are excellent writers for criticizing societal trends? I think I stumbled across Zygmunt Bauman by accident; his critique of \"societas\" and \"community\" interests me greatly because even if he may just end up being a curmudgeon in an academic uniform, there must at least be something worthwhile in studying past societies like Ancient Rome or Medieval Europe, as well...since they obviously dealt with similar problems (at different time scales). However, there seems to be so little information on him compared to say Noam Chomsky or Michael Harrington -- especially for the former which really piques your interest (as do their respective ideas concerning community and solidarity) after having read such things as Giddens' Theory of Structuration\". Any insight into modern Social Criticism would probably be appreciated.",
    "> So I've been single for around 2 years. As such, the only physical contact I've had has been masturbation. For the past few months I haven't been masturbating because I've been getting into running (and generally trying to be healthier), but this morning I got an urge that I had to give into. Normally during that situation I'm done pretty quickly. Today I was not able to achieve an climatic release.\n>\n> I'm not sure if it's because I didn't want to run afterwards or what, but literally for 3 straight hours I could not cum during masturbation. I would have sworn I was in \"the zone\" except for the \"tornado\" of nerves throughout my entire body (my best description) when I was on the edge. I could literally feel my body \"jolting\" when I felt those tingling nerves. After 3 hours of this I had to go to study so I put it on the backburner. I'm not going to say it's because I masturbate so infrequently but all I wanted was a quick fix when it came time to put clothes on and get out the door. It didn't even occur to me that I had been masturbating unsuccessfully for so long.\n>\n> Has anyone experienced anything like this? Could there be some strange biological explanation I'm missing?

    "A few nights ago I had the most vivid dream where I actually recognized it as my dream; and that's when everything kind of switched.

This isn't just something I see regularly come up on r/antiwork either but across most leftist sites where everyone thinks that our soldiers are all horrible people that go around killing kids for their own enjoyment without ever doing a lick of research into what actually goes down during combat operations in modern military units. Mostly what happens if my personal anecdote means anything will be you become much closer with your brothers by the end of each tour than you were to half of your family members back home so then losing someone (whether friend or enemy) feels like losing some part of yourself. People also try and use the fact we're trained how to kill enemies as proof we're psychopathic murderers. Yes we're technically trained on ways to harm others which sounds bad until you realize almost every job has a similar sort of training element tied somehow to safety precautions but no one ever complains about police officers knowing martial arts or mechanics being proficient at engine repair just on those terms alone. If we've trained on weapons use to the point of skill it allows us respond better when shots start flying without risking not getting ours fired fast enough, which becomes important when dealing with hostiles such as terrorists who are already trying everything in their power to get inside your head and mess with you emotionally while they do their best to kill you outright. We train on skills like first aid as well as medical response techniques so that should shit hit the fan we have more people capable of saving lives under hostile conditions since there simply won't always be doctors able to help after random firefights leave corpses covering whole blocks sometimes.

But the people that tell me that have short stature.\n\n- \"You're so tall for a man\", this is something I always hear in relationships. Usually it doesn't mean good. I really think that girls don't like tall men. My partner was the only girl that didn't mind my height.\n\n- I'm a person with low social skills, and I know that. I'm shy and have the worst social anxiety ever. It doesn't matter how good my posture to the world is, low height makes people look down on me (literally). Most people in my classes don't like to sit next to me. Usually the popular people are short. Sometimes it looks like people don't want to be seen with me in public. This situation makes me anxious, and it's not always good to talk with short or tall people.\n\n- It's hard to find clothes, shoes, furniture (like beds, chairs or tables) and everything else that's just too small.\n\n- I'm always in a bad position between the short people and the tall people.\n\n- I'm very conscious about my height. I spend too much time doing exercises that make me grow, because I think that I won't have a great life because of this, and I'm not really wrong: I can be fired from a job, can't make a girl fall in love with me, can be bullied in the street (and I have good reason to believe this can happen).

    "[Editor's Note - Author's Website] *****\nA couple months ago, I started writing an urban fantasy series for teens. After spending several years working at a local comic shop and then at an independent gaming store, where I ran their RPG/LARP groups and conventions, I thought this would be a way to share my love with teenagers who might not discover that part of geekdom otherwise. So without any real planning or preparation (other than getting some ideas while driving home from work one day), I sat down with only the basic premise in mind -- what if there was a young-adult superhero book set within the context of the modern political machine? And as such, you have The Senator’s Son.\nIt follows three main characters through its world – Chris Larkin, son of the title character; Dahlia Kairos, young protege to the current U.S. President; and John Mossimo, her bodyguard. Their story continues over three books (two are finished and being edited, so far) in which they get drawn into a conspiracy concerning the disappearance -- apparently murderous -- of various members of “the power elite family”, from senators to CEOs, all seemingly related somehow to each other or even the sitting presidents. The heroes must uncover both this web before time runs out…and why THEY themselves became involved. Meanwhile, the government wants Dahlia’s powers neutralized…permanently. As she struggles with this decision, she faces new, deadly foes of her own.\nI plan on keeping up production for these novels, now roughly 105k words apiece, once I start releasing them. But I also aim not just to create stories but make it easier for others interested in the genre to write similar works, or whatever type of fiction they choose. Therefore, once I am done with the series, hopefully later next year, the plan will go something like this: release two more stories featuring familiar people from the books and explore more areas about the lore of the setting. These will serve as tie-ins meant to answer questions raised by plotlines in the original trilogy. Then when released – either at the end of this final batch OR after I put the story arc to bed – there will be an open source license offered for",

My 2nd time, I was older, I had a real job, and I used my college tuition to take girls to dinner and pay for it afterwards. I was a player. I liked to think I had a lot of game, but in truth, it was just luck. I hit it with a lot of girls. I felt like I was in charge of my life. Fast forward to now, I am 51 years old and I am a senior in college studying to be an accountant. I had a lot of life experiences, not all good. I am now going through divorce. My wife (29) left me for another man (a 22 year old student she has been seeing now for a year). I was devastated, depressed, lost. I had the typical feeling I was not even that excited about. I thought I was a player, a stud, but now I was just a loser. I had one great sexual encounter at 45 years old when my step daughter was in the bed with me. I had slept with her mom before (who passed away a week later) and she was a wild lady. I had a great sexual experience with the girl. She was freaky and I loved it. Fast forward again, I am now 51 and I just had the best sexual encounter of my life. I was going with a girl I knew for 2 decades. I got her pregnant but I broke up with her because she was so damn jealous (we kept it, it wasn’t planned and she really didn’t see me as a father when we were together so we broke up.). Anyway, she would come into town from out of town and we would spend time together. She was a friend, someone I met with and had dinner or go for walk dates. She was beautiful and she knew that. She was a lot younger than me and so a lot more aggressive, more open",
    "\"Hi. I was a victim of sexual abuse while I lived in the Philippines and I’m back in the States now. A family member of a friend invited me to their home near the place I was staying and forced himself on me. He had already sexually abused several girls from the area around his house and I was just one more. He threatened that it would be bad for me if I spoke about it but as I was nearing my flight home I had a chance to call my dad about it and he told me to go to the police and get the bastard into jail where he belongs. Once I got to the airport I went to the police near the airport and filed a report. They informed a colleague at a police station close to the incident that my report was in order and the investigation would be started soon. They also gave me a document with an ID number on it that I could show to the airline to prove that I had met with police about this before leaving the Philippines. Unfortunately, I did not keep this ID card because I was in such a rush to get to the airport. What information do I have access to that I can use in the States to get some justice? I was so naive back then (I’m 27 now) that I thought once I returned here they would deal with it just because I told them and that if I didn’t, I wouldn’t get justice. It wasn’t until my parents sat me down one weekend and told me that filing with the police wasn’t enough and I would have to take some responsibility of filing a suit against them was I upset. I thought that if I filed the initial report that they would take care of things but I know now that just isn’t how it goes. I don’t want this to have happened to me in vain and I don’t want to be able to live with the fact that a pedophile is a free man while I suffer because of him. I don’t have his ID number, or the name of the police person I reported it to or the exact date it was done. I have a lot of good information though – I remember where his house was and who the family member was, the date I first met him is recorded on my passport so that will be easy to find. I do have the phone number",
    "To start things off, my relationship with my 'friend' (I think) can be described as \"on the rocks\" due to certain situations in which the friend in question would blame me despite me trying to do what was best for him. Due to this, I will refer to him as 'the friend' instead of his actual name.\n\nRecently, at a party, my friend got blackout drunk and started calling me things that are inappropriate for someone to say to his own friend, and he did it over and over again. This led to me taking him to the side and asking him what he was doing. The next thing I know, before I could think about how to do this, he started hitting me and hitting his own self as I was trying to keep him away (he's not fat, so this was easy) until he fell to the ground. In a moment of panic, I stepped on his hand to keep him restrained as a temporary 'punishment,' only to have my friend (a girl who's my friend as well) tell me that I was out of line, only to find out that he was, indeed, drunk and passed out during the entire thing. (Side note: While this was occurring, a friend of his had me make a joke about throwing him into a garbage bin outside only to find out he had lost the key)\n\nAfter waking up and finding himself face to face with me, he stated that he was sorry about the situation and that it was drunk talk. He also stated that he would move out of my parents' house with the money that my friend (not the one blacking out) has been saving. He also stated that he was angry at me about stepping on his hand and told me not to do that again, to which I said fine. After some thought, I asked myself if I really wanted to kick him out of the room, or if he was trying to manipulate me. I tried to keep these questions to myself because I would prefer not to have an argument, and I wanted to move on from the situations that led to this.\n\nLater on, me and his girlfriend's sister had a conversation in which she stated that she doesn't think stepping on his hand was an OK thing to do, even if he was out of line.

    "> I'm pretty sure that my endoscopy was cancelled for some reasons before or just after it started, and they did an esophago-gastroscopy instead with same prep and no sedation...and all these tests on a completely empty fasted stomach (so i think i really should say gastroscopy only)\n>\n> It has been three weeks since then when 4 doctors in private hospital where my gastroenterologist works (one had his appointment booked for two months hence in public hospital), diagnosed me with eroded oesophageal ring caused by barretts associated metaplasia of long term acid reflux disease which causes hiatal hernia of unknown size and GERD too. After one week of heavy antibiotics and antiretrovirals, everything seems to be good again although still very uncomfortable and painful eating anything including water etc. However as soon as i stop taking them or i take something else, they start poking up again...especially while going to sleep or not getting asleep properly through out night because i cannot digest much during day nowadays even having normal breakfast, lunch and dinner\n>\n> Is anybody here familiar with both disorders? How long will it take until endoscopy comes back safe enough if there are no bleeding problems anymore and how could i manage this condition without prescription drugs besides using apple cider vinegar twice per day for healing intestinal flora/villi damage so probably within 18 months period would be necessary according their prediction?????

    "Want to be hated? Want to make enemies with people who could give you actual meaningful career support, mentorship, and opportunity should your paths ever cross in real life for whatever reason? This is how. Here are some other good tips too!\n\n1. If someone makes an argument you don’t personally agree with, especially if it pertains to politics or policy, start by saying “you just want XYZ” (as opposed to “people who want XYZ [might argue] that…”) before giving any context to what they actually wrote. Include pejorative language like “gross,” “crazy,” “horrible/repulsive,” anything to suggest their motives rather than addressing their arguments head on. This shows humility; this demonstrates intellectual honesty and trustworthiness. Do not engage these ideas critically unless you are willing to concede the factual basis of those ideas when doing so will reveal flaws because, yes, of course your critics must have done their research perfectly while you didn’t, even though you were busy having lunch at Taco Bell instead of poring over statistics published by academic journals or government agencies whose mission statements explicitly state exactly what outcome data would ideally look like under each program model being discussed here but never mind all my caveats—what if I did read all this very fine literature last night anyway in preparation for today! That settles it then isn’t it huh?! Also take care not to quote directly off twitter where sources often aren’t cited at least not as nicely and succinctly as we might wish them quoted elsewhere perhaps preferably within blog posts written specifically for public consumption which may include citations but probably will still require quite a bit more digging around since nobody seems especially interested anymore except maybe academics themselves most likely working towards tenure promotions which requires copious amounts of publishing papers along with lots …and i mean lots!!..of grant writing money oh boy do we gots lots n lotta monies!!! And finally please ignore anyone who doesn’t think there must absolutely be one best way forward regardless our personal opinions about various tradeoffs inherent upon making decisions involving limited resources allocated amongst competing interests etcetera et cetera et so forth . Yes indeed thank goodness everyone agrees exactly what approach(es) should always work therefore why bother discussing matters further",
    "> I've been on 1mg Klonopin daily since January, and have decided to start tapering off it. My doctor has said that he doesn't want me to go below .5 mg per day (I was at 2mg/day when I started), but I would like to get down to zero if possible. Does anyone here have any experience with this? What kind of schedule did you use? How long did it take? Any advice or tips are appreciated! Thanks in advance.\n\nThe original poster received several responses, including one from user \"johnny_cash\" who wrote:\n\n> I went through a similar situation about two years ago. I had been taking 3-4mg of clonazepam every night for over ten years. It got to the point where my body just couldn’t handle it anymore. I tried to cut back by myself, but after three days of withdrawal symptoms I ended up going to the hospital. They put me on a slow taper which took almost six months to complete. During that time I experienced some pretty bad side effects such as insomnia, anxiety, depression, muscle spasms, etc. But once I finished the taper I felt great again. Now I only take 0.5mg of clonazepam every other night before bedtime. If you decide to do this yourself make sure you talk to your doctor first so they can monitor your progress. Good luck!",
    "> I had to take a moment today. I just left the funeral for a 3 year old kid that was murdered, along with his brother and his grandmother. As I watched this little boy, my son's age, in that coffin I started thinking of all the dead kids I've seen in the streets over my years in the military.\n>\n> You see, I started out in the infantry and then became a medic. Since then I've had to treat and watch too many innocent children who were victims of senseless acts, from car bombs (IEDs) or other similar acts in Iraq and Afghanistan. These are images that you never forget, especially when you're only a few years older than that kid in the coffin today, and these are images that you continue to deal with as you see these acts repeating themselves in your hometown from the same fucking people.\n>\n> You know, I really should count just how many kids I've had to treat when I was overseas, and the amount of innocents who paid the price because of the idiotic decisions of others. But it doesn't matter, because that list is too fucking long. I could easily type out a good 1,000 names of people that I've lost, and then type out a list of their accomplishments... I could easily write a list of all the beautiful young children that were victims of these horrific acts, people who will never grow up to have any impact on this world.\n>\n> This for all the dead homies that's never came home, that's never going to be at Thanksgiving dinner with their families, that's never going to be able to grow up and be the future leaders of this society. When you're young and you go to war, you're not thinking about becoming a military leader. You're thinking about your family, your country, helping others and making a difference.\n>\n> You don't sign a contract to become a leader of your country. You sign that contract because you're young, dumb, naive and you see yourself as an American hero. I signed for a fucking soldier's oath that's supposed to last a lifetime. That's something that you think is going to be a long shot,",
    "### Nursing.com SIMCLEX - IS IT ACCURATE?\n\nHello Nursing Students/Grads!\n\nThere are so many questions floating on here about this \"SIMULEX\" program by nursing.com. Most people are questioning its accuracy. I'm here to answer those questions. Hopefully it will give you the reassurance you are needing.\n\nAs many of you may know, they are offering a free 100 question NCLEX prep/simulated exam to take with our school's ID number. I, along with many schoolmates took it last night.\n\nThis morning I was on NCLEX'er (www.nclexer.com) and saw a LOT of posters that had issues/questions about the accuracy of the exam. There was no way of telling because the ID's for the testing were different.\n\nThey had questions like \"I saw my questions on here so I can't believe that's accurate, I didn't see MY question, it doesn't have the same exact answer choices, blah blah blah..........\"\n\nWell, I looked at nursing.com last night and it had the SAME EXACT SIMLEX they offer now! I knew from the moment I saw this I couldn't get the same questions and feel confident that this practice exam is not \"different\" than what everyone else received. I decided to call the University's dean, who is a registered nurse. I left her a message about what I saw in comparison.\n\nI told her they had a SIMCLEX 100 question on there that matched my ID number. She called me back and told me that she called Nursing.com and that she had been speaking with one of the heads of the company/administrators. They said that they pull the SIMLEX questions off of Nursing.com, which has the exact same questions!\n\nSO, it's up to you whether or not you want to take this exam! It might be a good idea to re-take the test if you didn't do well, maybe you will get different questions. It's still completely up in the air so",
    "Question/Discussion starter by troll_meister(1 week ago)I was not sure where to put this, but here goes nothing... Do you think there has ever been or could be any people (religious like Christianity, Judaism etc.) whose faith will survive intact even with just the mothers on Earth? I know most Christians would say no way without dads because they need to get married and reproduce for their children can grow in Jesus Christ's wisdom. However Jews only require 2 witnesses at minimum unlike most Christian denominations who only accept one male witness so what if all females got pregnant via artificial means by another species other than homo sapiens? Does anyone else believe any specific ethnic groups, cultures or religions could survive forever without men even after millions years having reached perfection through trial & error? Is it possible humanity doesn't necessarily have to end like dinosaurs did when a giant meteor hit their planet killing every living thing leaving behind nothing but ash & dust because those creatures were already dead before dying from external causes while others died later perhaps due genetic defects like cancerous cells growing too fast without control over natural checks against growth like death!",
    "college applications are a SCAM leave my broke ass alone\n\ntldr: College is a SCAM.\n\nThey are the same as getting a masters degree. You need to work 4 times as hard as everyone else to get in and you are still gonna flunk out at 3.5 GPA. The difference being is you dont have your parents and families to help you financially. For example my parents both got into Ivy League schools and had an easy college life. I have a full ride scholarship to a university and I’m still expected to work 3 jobs to pay for life. If you dont think going to college is a scam for low income you are mistaken. Here are a list of my complaints if you have no life and want to read them.\n\n1. If a college is giving me a full ride scholarship then why are they making me pay for dorms. I think they should be included in the “full ride scholarship” and not pay for food if im living in a dorm.\n2. The housing rates on campus are a rip off, especially if they don’t let you rent an apartment off campus and require you to buy a meal plan that also includes food at the dining halls.\n3. Forcing students to get meal plans is so they can make millions of dollars on the side by taking students money.\n4. I need to get 8+ hours of sleep a night, but for some reason I feel pressured into drinking myself to sleep every night so when I wake up I cant remember what I drunkenly agreed on.\n5. I have a mental disorder that effects my ability to sleep, so even though I went to bed at 2am, I have to wake up at 8am so I don’t get yelled at by staff.\n6. Most social events require purchasing expensive alcohol.\n7. I have a mental disorder (ADHD) and because the staff is not equipped to handle a student with a mental disorder I have to deal with emotional pain and not be able to get to my doctor for medication and therapy.\n8. The college gives me an extra $1000 and takes away $1000 from my account so I can “buy books”, so I have to work part time to get money to",
    "I'm 20 years old, female assigned at birth, and have been questioning my gender identity for about two months now. I don't know if this is just me being confused or not but here goes nothing...\n\nWhen I was younger (around age 13) I used to play with dolls all the time. My mom would buy them for me because she thought it was cute that I liked playing house and stuff like that. But as I got older I started getting more into video games and sports. I played basketball and soccer throughout high school and loved every minute of it. I also really enjoyed watching football and baseball on TV. When I turned 16 I got my first job working at a local grocery store. It wasn't long before I realized how much fun it was to work there. I made friends easily and had lots of laughs while doing my job. After graduating high school I decided to go back home and live with my parents again so they wouldn't worry too much about me going off to college right away. While living at home I continued working part-time at the same place where I met some great people who became close friends over time. One day one of these friends asked me out on a date which led us both down an interesting path together. We dated for almost three years until we broke up last year due to personal reasons. Since then I haven't felt comfortable dating anyone else since he was such a big part of my life. However, recently I began thinking differently about myself after reading articles online regarding gender dysphoria. This caused me to wonder whether maybe I am actually transgender? Or perhaps even nonbinary? Either way, I feel very confused right now and need help figuring things out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you :)",

    "> My father and I have always had an interesting relationship, but it has been getting worse over time. He was never really around when we were growing up (he worked 12 hour days) so he missed out on most of our childhoods. When we did see him, he would be very critical about everything that we did wrong. We are all adults now, but he still does this to us. It makes me feel like nothing I do will ever please him.\n>\n> Recently, I got married and moved away for work. This made things even more difficult because I am not able to visit as often as before. Whenever I call home, he asks how much money I make at my job and what kind of car I drive. If I tell him anything less than what he wants to hear, he gets angry with me. For example, last week I told him that I bought a used car instead of a new one. His response was \"You should have gotten a better deal.\" Then he asked why I didn't get a bigger house. I explained that there wasn't enough room in my budget for both a mortgage payment AND student loans. He said \"Well then you shouldn't have gone back to school!\"\n>\n> Another thing that drives me crazy is his constant criticism of my wife. She works part-time while she finishes her degree online. Every time she calls home, he tells her that she needs to find another job. He also complains about how expensive college tuition costs these days. But here's the kicker - HE IS PAYING FOR HER EDUCATION! So basically, he pays for something that he doesn't want her doing. And yet, whenever she tries to talk to him about it, he shuts down completely.\n>\n> There are many other examples like this where he acts like a jerk towards everyone else except himself.

My first week was great, I was having the biggest sleepover of my life every night and it was awesome so much so I made so many friends. Then this week happened so much so I’ve gained four new friends but lost the same amount. Today in Spanish class in the middle of Spanish all of a sudden I had a massive nose bleed and my skin and chest were burning so out of instinct to rub the burns for me to feel better I scratched the back of my head so hard with my nails I dug a hole into my head and the skin was all out.\n\nNow here’s the thing the nail of my ring finger that I scratched the hole with isn’t as sharp as it looks like which causes the scabs and the nail to be all cut and stuff now don’t freak out because I don’t want to go to the hospital I just don’t want to get anyone sick or spread anything to my roommates here. So long story short in my first week and a half of college I’ve already gotten four new friends and lost the same amount and I’m starting to think it’s because of some kind of outbreak but am I jumping the gun here ?

Then realized i wanted to put Service Pack 2 onto an external hdd. So after some thought, I took apart my PC because the External HD wouldn't accept the burn cd, so i decided to move away data, but then lost one folder i had just moved across and ended up panicking. And in my panic, i accidentally formatted the partition. It was on D instead as well..\n>\n> Now here are the steps I did which should hopefully assist you in solving this problem or at least giving me advise:\n> STEP ONE: Before I could unplug anything, I did check out if the files were still stored there with disk manager, but found none now...

    "I'm 25, my girlfriend is 30 and we have been together for about two years now. We are both in college (she has one more year to go) and live with her parents while she finishes school. She works part time at a local restaurant as well.\n\nWe met through mutual friends when I was still living back home after highschool. At first it was just casual dating but eventually things got serious between us. After about six months or so we moved into an apartment together which worked out great until she decided that she wanted to move back in with her family because they were having financial problems. It wasn't really what either of us wanted but since there weren't any other options available at the time we agreed on it being temporary until something better came along.\n\nNow here comes where things start getting complicated... About three weeks ago she told me that she had been seeing someone else behind my back for almost two months now! When confronted about why she didn't tell me sooner she said that he made her feel special again after all these years without anyone showing interest in her anymore due to our relationship falling apart over money issues etc.. So basically he gave her attention/affection which led them down this path towards cheating on me even though neither party involved knew how far things would progress beforehand.\n\nAfter hearing everything explained by both parties involved I felt like shit knowing that not only did I lose trust in my own gf but also failed miserably trying to keep up appearances around everyone else who thought nothing wrong ever happened between us despite knowing otherwise deep inside myself. Needless say i broke off contact immediately afterwards leaving no room open for further discussion regarding future plans involving eachother moving forward unless absolutely necessary.\n\nSo am I right in feeling angry towards my ex-girlfriend? Or should I forgive her considering circumstances surrounding their affair took place under false pretenses initially leading up till present day events unfolded causing irreparable damage beyond repairing anything left standing between us today?",

    "I'm 16 and I just got into Ozzy, but I don't know how to listen to his music in order. What album should I start with? And what albums are good after that one? Thanks!\n\nThe first thing you need to do is go out and buy Blizzard Of Ozz (the original version) on CD or vinyl if possible. It has all the songs he wrote for Black Sabbath before they kicked him out. You can also find it online as an mp3 download. If you want to hear some live stuff, check out Tribute. That was recorded at Madison Square Garden during the Diary tour.\n\nIf you like those two records then move onto Bark At The Moon which features Randy Rhoads playing guitar solos throughout most of the record. After that try No Rest For The Wicked which contains more great riffs by Jake E Lee who replaced Rhoads when he died in a plane crash. Then there's Just Say Ozzy which is basically a greatest hits collection featuring tracks from each of his solo albums up until that point. Finally, there's Down To Earth which is probably my favorite Ozzy album because it sounds so different than anything else he had done previously. He even sings about being sober on this one!\n\nHopefully these suggestions will help you decide where to begin your journey through Ozzyland...",
    "> What if I never find a partner, or someone to love?\n>\n> This has been on my mind for quite some time now and it's really starting to get me down. I am 21 years old and have had no luck with girls whatsoever. I don't know why but I just can't seem to attract them at all. It doesn't help that I live in a small town where there are only about 50 people my age (and most of those guys). I feel like I will be alone forever. I want nothing more than to meet someone who loves me as much as I do her/him. But I guess this isn't going to happen anytime soon...or ever!\n>\n> So here's my question: How long should one wait before giving up hope? Is there any point in trying anymore after so many failed attempts? Should we just accept our fate and move on with life without anyone else by our side? Or should we keep searching until death does us part? Please let me know your thoughts because right now I'm feeling pretty hopeless about everything. Thanks!\n\n## Answer\n\nI think you need to reframe how you look at things. You say you haven’t found “anyone” yet, which implies that you’re looking for something specific – a particular type of person. That’s not necessarily wrong, but it might limit your options. If you’ve already decided that you won’t date certain types of people, then you’ll miss out on opportunities when they come along. And even if you did find someone perfect, would she still be interested in dating you? Maybe not.\n\nSo instead of focusing on finding someone special, try thinking about meeting new friends first. Make connections wherever possible. Go places where lots of different kinds of people hang out together. Join clubs and organizations related to hobbies or interests you enjoy. Volunteer somewhere meaningful. Take classes at community colleges or online universities. Travel abroad whenever possible. Do anything that gets you outside yourself and into contact with others. Then see what happens next…",
    "I'm 23, and I haven't had sex in two years. It was my choice to stop having sex with my boyfriend at that time because he wanted me to have an abortion when we found out I was pregnant (we were both on birth control). He didn't want kids yet, but I did. So I told him no, and then stopped sleeping with him for about six months until I got over it. Then I started again, but only if he agreed not to pressure me into getting another one. We broke up after three more months because he couldn't handle being around someone who wasn't ready for children.\n\nNow here I am, still single and childless. My friends are all married or engaged now, so they don't understand why I won't just go back to dating guys like them. They say things like \"you can always get pregnant later,\" which makes me feel even worse than before! But what do you think? Should I try again soon? Or should I wait until I find someone else first?",

It's just an excuse for them to feel like they are part of something special. They think that if they listen to oldies then they can be cooler than everyone else who listens to pop music. But this isn't true at all! There were plenty of great musicians back in those days too; we just don't hear about them anymore because there wasn't much competition around when compared with today's marketplace where every single person wants attention so badly that they will do anything possible (including lying) just get noticed by someone important enough to give them some sort of recognition...even if only briefly before being forgotten again later on down the road once another new trend comes along which makes everything else seem outdated overnight without warning whatsoever...and yet somehow still manages manage make money off these same exact songs over again year after year despite having no real substance behind them other than catchy hooks/beats etcetera...but hey maybe i'm wrong here?

It could also be that I am getting older and more sensitive to these things...but seriously, why do so many people feel like they have to drive 10 miles over the speed limit at all times? Why are people constantly tailgating you when you are driving the posted speed limit? And why does every single person think that they can cut across three lanes of traffic to get into their exit lane?\n>\n> This morning was particularly bad for me. I had to drop my son off at school before work (he goes to a private school about 25 minutes away) and then head back home to go to work. On the way out of town, I got stuck behind someone who decided to stop in the middle of the highway because he wanted to turn left onto another street. He stopped right where the two lanes merge together, which meant that no one could pass him until he turned. So we were sitting there waiting for him to make his decision. Finally after about five minutes, he decides to turn left. But instead of turning left, he turns RIGHT! Now I know that some people don't understand how roundabouts work, but come on man! You see those signs everywhere telling you what direction each lane should take. If you aren't familiar with them, maybe you shouldn't use them until you learn how they work first. Anyway, once he finally gets going again, he starts slowing down even further than before. At this point I'm thinking \"what the hell is wrong with this guy?\" Then suddenly he slams on his brakes and stops dead in front of me. There was nowhere for me to go except straight ahead into oncoming traffic. Luckily nobody hit us, but it still made me angry as hell.\n>\n> When I got back home later today, I saw something similar happen while trying to leave my neighborhood.

This year his entire family (my brother-in-law, nephew and niece) went away for their annual reunion in Florida (it was his mother's 65th). His whole momma and daddy's side were there as well as my SIL/nieces. A handful of cousins even drove down. BF had been counting on inviting me but then two weeks before they left he brought up he would like me to go along so we can spend more time together over Christmas break and this upcoming summer since our own families won't be around us. At first it sounded great! Until I realized how much all those tickets cost!\n\nHe also thought of the kids going too until I found out $40+ per person each way including checked bags and seat assignments! Plus spending some of our funds on hotel stays if my SIL could swing not having anywhere for me stay with my SIS because my home wouldn't work because everyone lives far apart from one another. Now here comes the dilemma... The cost really got to me when he said my SIL wanted to give us gas cards back home after our travel costs are covered. Well now she changed directions and thinks it'd be cool if WE paid HER and everyone else's gas money on top of everything else?? We already have to pay for hotels!!! It seems silly to let a total expense of about $18k (family of five to take turns sharing rooms between them & myself), only get $2 gas reimbursement per round trip!!\n\nSo basically I asked myself what am I getting out of paying TWICE what everybody else does - which includes airfare and accommodations without any real compensation from anyone... Am I being too petty to say no due to other reasons besides price point alone though? If yes why?

    "> I'm 20 years old and have been playing guitar for about 13 years now. When I was younger (around age 7) my dad bought me an electric guitar and amp as well as some lessons at a local music store. After that first year or two of learning how to play basic chords and scales, I stopped taking lessons because they were too expensive and I didn't really feel like practicing anymore. My parents never forced me to practice either, which looking back on it now seems kind of stupid. They just assumed if I wanted to learn something then I would put in the effort myself. So after that point I pretty much taught myself everything else by watching videos online and trying to figure out songs by ear.\n>\n> Fast forward to today where I still don't know any theory whatsoever besides knowing all the notes on the fretboard and being able to read tablature.

It feels like there are certain parts of songwriting/music composition that I just don't understand yet even though I've tried reading books on it before without success. And since I haven't taken any formal lessons since I was young, I don't think anyone could teach me anything new anyway.\n>\n> What should I do?

    "I'm not sure if it was just me, but this film seemed to be more about Jesse and Celine than the first one. In Before Sunrise they were both young and in love with each other, but now that they are older and have had time to think things over, their feelings towards each other seem to change. They still care deeply for each other, but there seems to be something missing between them. It could be because they haven't seen each other since Vienna or maybe it has something to do with how much they have changed as people. Either way, you can tell that these two characters really mean a lot to each other even though they don't show it very often. This movie also shows us what happens when we grow up and realize that life isn't always perfect like we thought it would be. We all make mistakes along the way and sometimes those mistakes end up hurting someone else without meaning too. That's why it's important to learn from our past so we won't repeat history again.",
    "With the exception of the unabashedly enjoyable but ultimately forgettable \"Punisher War Zone,\" it seems that the superhero movie has become the latest trend in Hollywood after the likes of \"Iron Man\" became a mega-hit. Although the X-Men franchise has been struggling financially with its last two movies, \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" and \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\" these films have given us more of the same, only this time with different characters at the forefront. This film has been hyped up as the return to form of the franchise, but is the new film worth the hype?\n\nBased on Marvel's popular X-Men team of mutants and mutants, this film sees them go up against another team of mutants known as the Brotherhood for the safety of a girl named Jean Grey, who is the next powerful mutant that could ultimately lead the X-Men to victory against their enemies, the humans. But the Brotherhood's leader Magneto, who is the evil mutant who can control metal, wants to take Jean and the other mutants for his benefit. It is up to Professor Charles Xavier to lead his students that the X-Men comprise of in order to save Jean and ultimately defeat Magneto, all while a dark past returns to haunt and tempt Xavier's new pupil and protégé, Wolverine. This film is like the \"Spider Man\" series. This means that \"X-Men\" (or really, the first two) is the good in the series, \"X-Men 2\" is the excellent one, and \"X-Men Last Stand\" is the horrible follow-up. While I loved the action and the direction of this film, the story, characters, and logic problems get on my nerves to no end.\n\nWhile the performances from the cast were good (James McAvoy as Xavier, Jennifer Lawrence as Jean, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Michael Fassbender as Magneto, Alex Gonzales as Iceman, January Jones as Emma Frost, and Nicholas Holt as Beast), the characters were written by the worst writer I've seen to date.

    "This wonderful story would not be possible without science fiction writer Andy Weir’s clever and entertaining novel “The Martian.” It was only recently published in June 2014, but this little book quickly gained popularity on Amazon sales listings before it got picked up by Random House to publish more extensively. Even as early as last September, director Ridley Scott had already decided that he wanted to make the film version with actor Matt Damon playing Mark Watney. This movie has some big shoes to fill. In reality, you don’t even have to see the film because the movie works just as well if read first—the pages are easy to tear through while you’re engrossed inside Watney’s voice; his humor really brings me (and many others) into believing I’m there with him, watching and experiencing everything. That said, the visual effects combined are astounding, especially those made from scratch for the NASA/science buffs.\n\nSo what can we say about science when considering this film? Well, nothing bad, since all the space ships and equipment in these films were based upon actual or close replicas of real existing things found here at Earth’s surface. Yes, you get your fancy looking future vehicles like Ares IV’s rovers. However, no matter how much they try to depict futuristic inventions, they still take care to stay practical, staying within the bounds of scientific law so that nothing breaks physics for our own universe—because that stuff right there, such as violating fundamental laws that keep everything sane and orderly around us every day, would never happen unless you've created other dimensions in existence where different forms rules apply instead, allowing scientists to play God so long as their magic toys don’t affect ours too badly...but any way you slice it - all good films should follow basic guidelines which include obeying physical phenomenon when applying sci-fi concepts onto screens everywhere.",

    "This movie combines so many things to make it an amazing movie -- and no one gets excluded! Children will have fun, and older audiences can enjoy all the references to their favorite fables & fairy tales as well as subtle jokes that children won't understand. All the animals do such funny voices, like Eddie Murphy (donkey) does the voice of Donkey; Rupert Everett does the voice of Prince Charming; Walt Dohrn, John Cygan does the voice of Robin Hood etc..\n\nThe film has 3-D animation done by DreamWorks SKG which puts it in direct competition with other major animated movies like Pixar Studios. In addition, Mike Myers does most if not all his performance as Shrek on one breath, but I was surprised at how believable he sounded. Then you get the love story between Shrek and Fiona played perfectly by Cameron Duncan (voice of Princess Fiona). Even the ogre's friends/helpers were done right--you couldn't help but feel bad about Puss In Boots. This cat was extremely well-animated and did it so well that you just melted with him during his scenes especially when he is trying to save his new master's life after they became buddies. A lot went into this picture and as long we keep making good movies that bring families together everyone will be happy to spend time watching it. One thing worth pointing out, though: the best cartoon in my book goes to Aladdin!!!!!",
    "Alright, to set the record straight, I know there are probably more people who will watch \"Selma\" based on their familiarity with either King, the Civil Rights Movement, or simply because of the fact that some prominent, very black actors are starring in it.\n\nNow, it's not a bad thing and it is commendable that people want to learn more about their history and that's part of the reason why people go out to the cinema. However, the majority of people who are not that familiar with the Civil Rights Movement will probably walk away with little or no information about the events that unfolded in Selma.\n\nAnd I won't go on a rant about why our history is not taught in our educational system, it is just what it is. But, I have to make a reference to an old commercial that I thought was funny. A guy and a girl who met each other on a blind date are standing on a park bench in an open space.\n\nThe guy turns to the girl and says, \"Why did your parents send you to a Jewish school?\" The girl replies, \"My parents are Jewish.\" The girl then asks, \"Why didn't your parents send you to a public school?\" The guy replies, \"My parents are not Jewish.\"\n\nAnd that is where I was at as I walked out of the theater. I thought, why would Hollywood make \"Selma\" if they know little to nothing about the civil rights movement?\n\nThis is not a biopic (and I really think they should have called it that, otherwise it would fall within the same category as the other civil rights movies that have been done) because it does not cover King's life. So, I was pleasantly surprised that a lot of ground was covered in the movie.\n\nThe cast was good. I like that they used prominent black actors and actresses to portray the pivotal role players during the movement.\n\nTim Roth was very unnerving as George Wallace. His presence in each scene gave me chills. And I really enjoyed Common's role as the late James Forman. That was the role that he was truly made for.\n\nI thought \"Selma\" was well done. David Oyelowo was superb as",
    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but it was certainly entertaining and well-made. It has an interesting storyline that keeps you guessing throughout. There are some great action sequences as well as some very tense moments. The acting is good all around with Ryan Gosling giving one of his best performances yet. Carey Mulligan also does a nice job in her role. Overall, Drive is worth checking out if you're looking for something different than your typical Hollywood fare.\n\nThe plot revolves around Driver (Ryan Gosling), who works as a stunt driver by day and moonlights as a getaway driver at night. He meets Irene (Carey Mulligan) while working on a heist with her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac). When things go wrong during the robbery, Driver finds himself caught up in more trouble than he bargained for. As he tries to protect Irene and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos), he becomes embroiled in a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse with mob boss Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and his henchmen Nino (Ron Perlman) and Shannon (Bryan Cranston).\n\nOne thing that struck me about this film was how much it reminded me of Michael Mann's Heat. Both films feature protagonists who work in criminal enterprises but have strong moral codes that they adhere to. They also both deal with themes such as loyalty, betrayal, and redemption. However, where Heat is a sprawling epic spanning multiple cities over several years, Drive is much smaller in scope and takes place almost entirely within Los Angeles over just a few days. This gives the film a more intimate feel which helps to draw you into its world.\n\nAnother thing that impressed me about Drive was its use of music. Cliff Martinez did an excellent job composing the score which perfectly complemented the visuals on screen. In addition, there were several songs used throughout the film which helped set the tone for each scene. One song in particular - Kavinsky's Nightcall - became so iconic after being featured prominently in trailers that it ended up becoming part of the soundtrack itself!\n\nOverall, Drive is a solid entry into the crime genre that will appeal",
    "This film was made in 2006, but it could have been made at any time during the last century or so. It's about Ireland and its struggle to be free of British rule. This story takes place between 1920-1923 when the Irish Republican Army (IRA) fought against the British army. There are many films on this subject, but none as good as this one.\n\nIt tells the story of two brothers who join the fight for freedom. One brother becomes disillusioned with the violence and leaves the country while his younger brother continues fighting until he too has had enough.\n\nI don't want to give away anything else because you should see this movie if you haven't already done so. If you like history then this will interest you; if not then maybe just watch it anyway because it's well worth seeing even though there isn't much action involved except towards the end where things get pretty bloody!",

    "I saw this film in Tokyo 1990 and it was like watching a dream. In comparison, my memories are a little blurry, but I remember not only being amazed by the beautiful graphics and animation but also the storyline and characters. The main characters were very interesting and funny while retaining a sense of danger and urgency to the plot. A very entertaining film that is fun for adults and kids as well.\n\nCastle in the Sky is an anime movie from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. The basic story involves a \"Castle\" that floats in the sky called Laputa. Two people are fighting over the castle: a military, industrialist, who wishes to capture it to use its powerful technology to control all the nations, and a pirate Captain who wants to use it to rule the sky. The story is exciting and captivating, with action, drama and even light humors.\n\nLaputa (also called Geddo) is a \"lost\" space civilization in the skies that has been forgotten for ages. There's a bit of steampunk in the design for the old tech (some of which would be futuristic, if they'd had the technology). There's also a bit of the old school pulp sci-fi flavor to much of the design and overall feel of Laputa, even if it does look a great deal like something that could be found in medieval times. It has a kind of \"wonderland feel\" to it.\n\nWhat makes this film great is the unique design of the characters, the quality of the animation, and its interesting plot. I especially want to point out how much the design of the characters in Castle in the Sky is different from anime that was typical of the era that this movie was made. The designs of the characters was refreshingly different and very memorable. I enjoyed the overall look of the movie, and I think it's beautiful how the character designs fit into the setting so well. The quality of the animation is very good, and you can really see how much effort was put into the movie. The sound is well done and there's a good variety of music; it's not all just generic background music like so many films. The story itself is interesting enough that I enjoyed",

    "“The filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was not interested in any simple narrative or genre structure when he embarked upon his adaptation of “The Luck Of Barry Lyndon”, William Makepeace Thackeray's 1844 novel, to be published two years later by the London publishing house Chapman & Hall with illustrations and engravings done by Phiz (John Leech). Indeed, the author himself did note that no one could tell how such an epic work would play for a cinema audience. What he did understand perfectly well however was that the central figure Barry would have become as familiar as Dickens’ Mr. Micawber should the author have been so fortunate as to create him while alive.\n\nIn adapting this great tale that takes place over the early decades of both Britain and America's histories Kubrick has chosen to present it uncompromisingly without sentimentality in an elegiac tone much more akin to the original. To begin and end where the source does, but to do little else on its own merit; leaving most of the credit instead due directly to author Thackeray alone for presenting perhaps the greatest heroic antihero since Shakespeare's Falstaff; Barry Lyndon is quite possibly even the world's first bad boy. For his efforts Kubrick received some negative reviews claiming an inappropriate lackluster pace which was countered immediately afterward by others who lauded the films very deliberate pacing with praise and accolades galore eventually leading to nine Academy Award nominations among them including Best Director and winning those for Cinematography along with Costume Design followed in short order by the Cannes Film Festival's Palme D'Or award among many others the like that few modern films see today...”",

    "\"All the President's Men\" is a 1976 American political thriller film directed by Alan J. Pakula and produced by Pakula and Robert Evans. The screenplay by William Goldman is based on the 1974 non-fiction book of the same name by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two reporters for The Washington Post who investigated the Watergate scandal. The film stars Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively, and features Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jason Robards, Hal Holbrook, Jane Alexander, Meredith Baxter, Jack Gordon, Ned Beatty, Stephen Collins, and Hal Holbrook.\n\nThe film was released on April 9, 1976, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $70 million at the box office and winning four Academy Awards, including Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Robards. It was nominated for seven other Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nThe film begins with a montage of newspaper headlines about the Watergate scandal, which was a political scandal that occurred in the United States in the 1970s as a result of the June 17, 1972, break-in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. The break-in was arranged by the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CRP), the committee responsible for the re-election of President Richard Nixon. The scandal led to Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, the only resignation of a U.S. president.\n\nThe film then cuts to a scene in the newsroom of The Washington Post, where the editor, Ben Bradlee (Robards), is discussing the Watergate scandal with his staff. He tells them that the Post is going to run a story about the scandal, and that they need to find out who is behind it. He then assigns two reporters, Bob Woodward",
    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but it was entertaining enough that I didn't mind spending my money on it. It has some good action scenes and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Sherlock Holmes is very enjoyable. Jude Law also does well in his role as Dr. Watson. Rachel McAdams plays Irene Adler, who is one of the few women that can hold her own against Holmes. She doesn't have much screen time though, so she isn't given much opportunity to shine. Mark Strong plays Lord Blackwood, an evil magician/occultist who wants to take over London with his army of zombies. He's pretty creepy looking, but he doesn't really do anything interesting until near the end when he tries to kill everyone at Buckingham Palace (including Queen Victoria). There are several other characters who appear briefly throughout the film including Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes (Sherlock's older brother), Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade (a Scotland Yard detective) and Kelly Reilly as Mary Morstan (the love interest). Overall, this wasn't bad for a summer blockbuster. If you like action movies then you might enjoy watching this one too!",
    "The only way to fully grasp how the U.S is currently conducting operations throughout their nation and abroad using our tax dollars, you need to watch this film in it entirety. A lot was happening during Snowdens tenure with the CIA and NSA that were clearly not in accordance with 4th Amendment rights as far back as December of 2005 and well after his resignation. One example; If they suspect someone will do something dangerous within a given timeframe they can surveille them without any warrantees. But once they have the data/evidence of said offense(s), the case must be brought before the FISA court which reviews matters within these very narrow guidelines. When one goes out on their own and begins snooping like Clintons private server, or the FBI wiretapping Trump Towers (allegedly) then we are all in trouble. No person has the right and certainly no government entity should be able to violate the privacy of citizens with such unbridled impunity.\n\nI was quite interested in seeing how Jeremy Renner portrayed S.O.A.M, but it seemed unnecessary to me because S.O's real life counterpart in some ways didn't come across nearly as likable or empathetic. He is depicted rather coldly while Renee Russo plays more along the lines of an enabler who at times seems dispassionate to everything he does - even when she tries to show her husband what S.O. accomplishes in a meeting, by showing him files of children murdered. There are moments where Mizrusso comes off too dryly, and even though it may be intentionality due to long years together maybe the wife did grow a little jaded? It would also explain why S.O. has grown desensitized overtime having witnessed so much horror first hand but still has not been scarred? What's amazing about such great screenwritng is if you look below there are several facts hidden deep within dialogue exchanged between those two characters who happen sit facing away/side-by- side each other on multiple occasions.

It was not what I expected at all; in fact, I think that Stanley Kubrick deliberately set out to make something different than his usual fare (which would be hard to do). This is an adult drama with some very erotic scenes, but no nudity or sex. There are also many dream sequences which add to the surreal nature of the story.\n\nThe plot revolves around Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise), who discovers that his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) had fantasies about having affairs while he was away on business. He then goes through a series of adventures trying to find out if she really did have these thoughts, and how far they went. Along the way, he meets several people who seem to know more about her than he does, including a prostitute named Domino (Todd Field).\n\nThis isn't your typical Hollywood blockbuster by any means. In fact, there aren't even any explosions! But it still manages to keep you interested throughout its entire running length. And although it may not appeal to everyone, those who enjoy psychological thrillers will definitely want to check this one out.",

    "The first Pixar movie with a female protagonist was A Bug's Life. In general, women are not the main characters in many action films. This may be due to the fact that women tend to be more emotional, not as violent, and a lot more caring compared to men. In addition to that, there are movies that target a certain gender. This is a great example of a movie with a female protagonist with action and adventure elements for children and adults.\n\nIt was nice to see women in the movie as warriors and leaders. It also shows women as strong and independent. There is one woman who is a witch, whom many of the characters were afraid of at first. But at the end, it was discovered that she was not evil. It was also nice to see that she is smart and cares for her family. And she is able to make peace with the other women. It seems that the movie is all about a female-oriented society, unlike in some societies in the West nowadays.\n\nAlso, it was nice to see a woman become the main warrior in a battle. I liked the way the queen was always trying to find a solution for a problem and that she is brave enough to do almost anything to succeed. And it was also nice to see a scene where Merida is able to save herself from being shot by an arrow by a wolf. It just goes to show that women have unique skills compared to men, and that women need to be appreciated.\n\nThe animation was well done with good colors and the expressions of the people were also good. The movement of the characters was also well done. The scenery was also very beautiful. The action scenes were also well done, with the bow-and-arrow fight being the most action-filled fight. In fact, the action scenes actually have a meaning in the story. For example, the swordfight is actually a form of courtship. The movie also shows a good mix of action and traditional Celtic customs.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that Merida is actually a Scottish princess, making her a more unique character in the Pixar world, who is an actual person unlike many other Pixar characters such as Andy from Monsters Inc. She actually looks like a real person and has her own individual character. She is actually a human princess and not an animated",
    "This film was very well done, and it's not just because Christian Bale lost 60 pounds to play Dicky Eklund (although that certainly helped). It's also due in large part to Mark Wahlberg's performance as Micky Ward, which was excellent. He really captured the essence of this man who had been through so much but still managed to keep his head up and fight on. Amy Adams did an amazing job playing Charlene, too; she brought out all sorts of emotions with her portrayal of this woman who loved Micky despite everything else going on around them at times. And finally there were some great supporting roles by Melissa Leo as Alice Ward (Micky & Dicky's mother) and Jack McGee as George Kingston (their trainer). All these actors worked together perfectly to create one cohesive story about family loyalty and perseverance against all odds!",
    "> My friends, we are about ready to begin our fourth year at home in exile here in England and our thoughts wander back across Europe on those many years gone by... Many things come before my eyes, but just one stands out above all else: When Adolf Hitler had made war against us as well as against others... All that had been dear to me was now lost or far away; friends were dead or missing without trace ... In 1943 came another hard blow when Germany suffered its first great reversals. It gave me new hope, but there still remained little more than dreams... However, even then an idea took shape in my mind which held such promises if only the situation should improve sufficiently. That I could not foretell, so again silence fell until I got news that Britain's best team - Arsenal Football Club - including Joe Mercer and Jack Kelsey, would soon be coming over to Holland... At once I planned the details and arranged it with all due discretion. There was no question whatever of letting anyone know what had entered my mind. I did everything single-handedly... I risked imprisonment and death rather than have others guess about it. And although time went past day after day - a year, two, three -- nothing happened and still neither my hopes nor my fears increased... Then suddenly things began to move rapidly... I tried to speed them up through our camp representatives... There was talk of playing friendlies abroad, of going into Switzerland, going to Holland... So it went on week after week - month after month - and always one hurdle seemed greater than the other... But thereafter it moved almost too slowly. For some months I didn't hear anything, except that Joe had been selected to make regular trips between London and Geneva where he talked it all over, yet to no purpose. Nothing happened.\n>\n> Just how much danger people find themselves in when they can talk freely depends largely upon their surroundings.

Why do it? Because, if we take a look at where audiences have been taken by storytellers over the last century, there should be a strong argument to think that every adventure tale has already been told. That might not bode well for films or novels with established tropes---like Sherlock Holmes stories having all been published between 1890 - 1927---but thankfully, audiences still enjoy characters such as those created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle because each entry reveals something new about them and challenges previous expectations. And when an audience is confronted with more from a great character than before, they always respond with positivity and enthusiasm, especially when it comes to their favorite ones.\nIt takes an extremely confident filmmaker indeed to come back to classic genres and provide audiences again with what they want; but also keep presenting them with fresh things too so that they can get engrossed once again...which brings us back to Spielberg! While critics may continue making the mistake of thinking that he's fallen out of love with making films like \"Indiana Jones\", \"Jaws\" etc., Spielberg does in fact know exactly how these characters and concepts work, and continues challenging himself each time out to add another dimension onto his own creations. Audiences may remember Spielberg struggling to come up with ideas for Raiders III and Indiana IV, which meant some ideas had to change or drop altogether. But with the technology available today giving his team unprecedented visual tools, they were able produce jaw dropping imagery and deliver to fans one of the best examples where cutting edge FX are used well and never show off needlessly (there is even a scene without any digital trickery).

The first, despite being a highly entertaining time-travel romp, was the least impressive of the trilogy to my youthful mind, as it was the most reliant on its genre gimmicks. The second film, \"Back to the Future Part II\" (BTTF2), was superior as it dived much deeper into the story's intricacies and explored the implications of traveling back and forth through time much more fully. BTTF2 was much more serious, and while I enjoyed it more, I didn't much like it back then. On rewatch, I was surprised by its depth, and how effective it was as a dark sci-fi horror film. Its main conceit is that it explores a world where Marty McFly (played wonderfully by Michael J. Fox) didn't come back from the old west, and it explores the fallout of that event. It's an ambitious idea, but the end result is a film that can sometimes seem overstuffed. Regardless, it is a superb sequel that does a great job of living up to the high standards of its predecessor. There also appears to be a trend with time travel films in which the sequels are much more interesting than the preceding installments. \"Looper\" suffers from this problem, and although BTTF2 is in many ways superior to its predecessor, its lack of character development and its plot holes can be problematic. That said, it is the best time travel film I've seen, and its success is built upon the clever and imaginative ideas that it builds from.\n\nBTTF2 takes place in 1985, just a couple of years after the first film. Doc Brown, played by the ever-inspirational Christopher Lloyd, is a much more eccentric character than in the first film, having dedicated the years following his last adventure in a time machine to the science of time travel, while Marty has become used to his newfound celebrity status and seems to have little to no ambition. Brown has invented a time machine that can travel in both directions through time, which he has built on his futuristic flying DeLorean, which allows them to",
    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but it was certainly an interesting experience. It's based on the true story of the Zodiac Killer who terrorized San Francisco in the late 1960s and early '70s with his taunting letters to newspapers and police departments. He claimed responsibility for several murders that he never actually committed (or at least there has been no proof), and then disappeared into thin air after sending one last letter to the San Francisco Chronicle. This film follows three men as they try to solve the case - Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cartoonist for the Chronicle; Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) is a reporter for the same paper; and Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) is the lead investigator on the case.\n\nThe first thing you notice about this film is how well-made it is. Director David Fincher (\"Fight Club,\" \"Panic Room\") does a great job creating atmosphere and tension throughout the entire picture. There are some truly creepy scenes here, especially when we see the killer stalking his victims or writing those chilling letters. And the cinematography by Harris Savides is top-notch, giving us beautiful shots of San Francisco during its heyday. But despite all these technical achievements, something just doesn't quite click with me about this movie. Maybe it's because I already knew how everything turned out before seeing it (the ending isn't really much of a surprise). Or maybe it's because none of the characters are particularly likable or sympathetic. Whatever the reason, I found myself feeling detached from most of what happened on screen.\n\nThat said, there are still plenty of things worth praising here. Jake Gyllenhaal gives another strong performance as Graysmith, even if he seems like more of a side character than anything else. Mark Ruffalo also turns in solid work as Toschi, although he could have used more screen time since he plays such an important role in solving the case. As for Robert Downey Jr., he's fine but nothing special as Avery. His character arc feels somewhat rushed and underdeveloped compared to everyone else's. Overall though, this is",
    "I've seen this film twice now, and it was just as good both times. It has everything you could want in a movie - romance, action, drama, comedy, tragedy...and even some nudity! (Although not much.) This is one of those movies that will be remembered forever. James Cameron did an excellent job with directing, writing, producing, etc., but he also deserves credit for casting such great actors/actresses. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are perfect together on screen; they have amazing chemistry. Billy Zane plays his role perfectly too. He really makes me hate him. And Gloria Stuart does a wonderful job playing Rose at 101 years old. She looks so young! Overall, this is definitely my favorite movie ever made.",
    "A man walks across London and starts to notice how many little signs there are that everyone else in love but him (which he had noticed before), this causes problems as it makes him realize that when so much of who you are comes from your experiences, if your heart has been broken that breakage can never truly be repaired, and his feelings have become uncontrollable and he falls into a pit, where everything begins to disintegrate around him (a lot like the scene in \"Ghost World\") until his head swims with grief over not having what we all take for granted. Love can be painful even in triumph because each day spent without someone close feels worse than death. It's an interesting concept, but it didn't work very well here unfortunately; there were too many plot lines going on at once that kept changing. For the first time ever my favorite film, \"The Breakfast Club\", was mentioned at one point during conversation about high school films (\"Say Anything.\") This story tries to show us people dealing in their own way with matters of the heart, the good of others trying to console friends through suffering or joy, while the bad try to deceive loved ones, all in hopes of getting something back in return. There isn't really any real message except whatever anyone wants it to be (but I wouldn't say anything meaningful anyway). What does come off though is a general lack of sincerity despite some attempts made, which might be okay considering most romance novels arenâ€™t intended as artistic creation or insight about life itself just entertainment by simple means . At least no one got hit by cars this time unlike last week!",
    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but it certainly has its moments and some very good performances by Jessica Chastain as Maya (the CIA agent who tracked down Bin Laden) and Jason Clarke as Dan (her boss). It also features an excellent performance by Mark Strong as George Miller, head of the CIA station in Pakistan.\n\nThe story begins with the 9/11 attacks on New York City and Washington D.C., then moves forward through the years until we reach the final raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Along the way there are many scenes showing torture sessions where information was extracted from prisoners. These were real events, so they had to be included, but they do seem gratuitous at times. There is one scene involving waterboarding that goes on far too long and seems more like a horror flick than anything else.\n\nThere are other problems with the script. For example, when Maya first arrives in Islamabad she meets up with her old friend Jessica (Jennifer Ehle), who tells her about a man named Ammar al-Baluchi (Reda Kateb), whom she believes may have been involved in planning the attack on the World Trade Center. This leads us into another subplot involving Ammar's brother Ali Abdul Aziz Ali (Fares Fares), who turns out to be working for Al Qaeda. But why would he want revenge against America? He doesn't even live here! And how did he manage to get away after being captured during the initial invasion of Afghanistan?\n\nAnother problem occurs later when Maya learns that Amir Mirza (Khalid Abdalla), a former member of the Taliban, now works for the Pakistani government. She asks him if he knows anything about Ammar or his family. He says no, but then adds that he does know someone who might help them find out. So why didn't he just tell her right off instead of making her wait around all night while he went home to sleep?\n\nFinally, there's the ending itself. After spending two hours watching these characters go back and forth between different countries trying to figure out who killed their loved ones, you expect something big to happen. Instead, we get nothing except a brief shot of Maya walking",
    "\"Walk the Line\" is a biographical drama, inspired by the personal lives of famous country singers Johnny Cash and his wife June Carter.\n\n\"Walk the Line\" is a very good movie, with great performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. The film shows Johnny Cash's life as he grew up to become an early country singer in the 1940s, which later would make him a very famous country singer.\n\nHis early life revolved around music, though he was a rebellious kid who hung out with gangs and the wrong crowd. This part of Johnny's life is where Joaquin Phoenix shines best, as he shows the struggles of the young youth of that period who felt trapped in a dead-end life, and who felt as if there was no way out. His performance in this film is much better than most of his other performances and, in my honest opinion, is his best role ever; he brings out the true personality of Johnny Cash.\n\nJohnny's struggles led him to the military, where he found the sense of discipline he was looking for his life. This military life and the way he conducted himself earned him respect by his fellow soldiers and officers. It also led him to find religion, and through this, Johnny learned to play the guitar and became a country singer. His music career eventually led him to fame with his single I Walk the Line, and he also went on to become romantically involved with June Carter.\n\nJune Carter herself goes through a series of struggles with her own romantic life. With Reese Witherspoon giving the performance as June Carter, she helps to bring out her complex personality, which includes a strong sense of self. Her performance also helps people to understand why the relationship between Johnny and June started to blossom and how it became serious. The romantic life of these two is both passionate and heartbreaking, but it helps form the basis for the success of their music careers.\n\nThe music by Johnny Cash has always been popular, with a strong influence on later country music singers. The music in this movie is mostly the original recordings of Johnny Cash himself, with only the vocals redone by Joaquin Phoenix. A lot of moviegoers have been complaining, through word of mouth and other reviews, about the music being different",
    "> This movie got off on the wrong foot, and never really recovered from it. It spends so much time focusing on trying to get Diana to become Wonder Woman like her mother told her to, the movie kind of forgets to tell us the story of Wonder Woman. It takes until two thirds of the way through the movie to realize that in between the story of her childhood and her getting from the island to fighting Aries, that they're leaving out the entire section where she trained to become Wonder Woman. For me, that's a major complaint, and that's not even counting everything else wrong with the movie. It's trying to be too many things and not doing them well at all.\n>\n> The movie tries to be a feminist movie, but it doesn't know what feminism is in the first place. It tries to be a hero with a heart movie, but it completely glosses over what makes those types of films good. The movie tries to tell a heartfelt WWII movie, but it also forgets that that genre had a lot of important themes in it. That movie is trying to mix every possible movie genre and it's doing a terrible job at it. I went to see the movie in a theater with a bunch of hardcore comic book fans, and we all agreed, for whatever reason, that the best parts of the movie were all the scenes where Steve was having sex with Diana.\n>\n> Not once in thirty years was I ever impressed with the art of Zack Snyder. The guy makes movies that are always visually interesting, even if the story of the movie is just plain bad. If there's one thing that people should say about Zack Snyder, is that his stories suck, and he's one of the biggest hacks in all of Hollywood.\n>\n> I don't know what Patty Jenkins, the director, was thinking. At one point she tries to rip-off X-men: Days Of Future Past, and at another point in a scene near the end of the movie, Gal Gadot does her best imitation of the famous line from Gladiator, which was in a previous Zack Snyder movie 300. At one point she even tries to imitate Super Hero's",
    "### \"Forrest Gump\" (1994)\n\n[rating:9/10]\n\nWhat I'm about to say about this movie is not my opinion. It's also not just my opinion. A number of famous critics have also said it, and I'm just paraphrasing what they've had to say. This movie isn't a movie but a masterwork, an example of art, of cinema at its best.\n\nRarely do you find a movie that works on so many levels. You're caught emotionally, spiritually and with a sense of awe watching the story unfold in this film. It isn't about the production or even the acting of the movie but really the script. And Tom Hanks as the titular character. A true classic in every way.\n\nAs I said, this movie is not just my opinion. This movie has been cited in various literary text, such as this book which examines Forrest's life and the influence he had on the world.\n\n\"Forrest Gump\" is a movie that can be watched over and over again but it may be difficult to find it on the shelves. I have no problems recommending it. It's so good it deserves two thumbs up.\n\n### From the book:\n\n\"The events of an illustrious life, so completely recounted in a film that I hesitate to give you any summary. Just know that Gump was an unwitting hero who impacted the world profoundly, but always from a slight distance and always incidental to his goal of being with and doing for Jenny. A man who never intended to become famous yet wound up with that most common of fates: His life is used as a case study, to demonstrate how a handful of pivotal moments can and do forever alter our place in the universe.\"\n\n-- Excerpt From: Michael Keaton. \"Forrest Gumps: Influence on Life\" (Paperback book)",
    "'Peaceful Warrior' (2006)\n\nRating: 9 out of 10\n\nNice job, guys! This movie was very well-received at the Sundance Film Festival in 2006 and was released theatrically to some success. 'Peaceful Warrior' tells the story of the 1970s Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz), a \"grizzled\" gymnast who aspires to be recognized as the top performer at Berkeley's gymnastics facility. His life is turned upside down when he is run over by a car and finds himself in the care of Socrates (Nick Nolte), an ex-Marine-turned-gym owner. Socrates puts into him the concepts of Eastern martial arts and philosophy (yoga, meditation, zen), which Dan has trouble understanding. After becoming involved with Jenny (Amy Smart), a beautiful blonde art student, who is uninterested in him, Dan's career as a gymnast seems to be a failure and he ends up falling behind a newcomer, Dancer Dan (Cody McMains), who is the top student at the gym. It's after a heartbreaking loss at a tournament that Socrates sees that Dan isn't following his path of righteousness, and he pushes him (both physicially and psychologically) down a road to self-discovery.\n\nThis film was inspired by two different books; 'An Exquisite Sense of What is Beautiful', which is a book about Dan's life journey of self-discovery, and 'The Peaceful Warrior: Standing in the Still of the Wind', which is a self-help based fiction book about a warrior called Socrates. 'The Peaceful Warrior' has been an inspirational book for a lot of people, including myself at a different period of my life. 'Peaceful Warrior' the movie is extremely well-shot with superbly accurate flashbacks to the '70s. The soundtrack of this film is pretty decent and a great mix of 1970s rock and some newer pop tunes like \"Stand Up\" by",
    "Director Adam Rifkin's DEMOCRACY BOULEVARD was one of my favorite feel-good movies in recent memory, but with ROCK CITY he outdoes himself by taking a familiar concept with an awful title and transforming both into something spectacularly enjoyable. This is basically NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VAN WILDER, or maybe ANIMAL HOUSE set to the hard sounds of glam rock as performed under hot lights somewhere near the Canadian border. Hawk (Edward Furlong) and Bobby Beers' (Josh Hamilton) only goal in life is to get backstage passes for Judas Priest at the Cobo Arena. On their cross country quest they take along Lem (Sam Huntington), a huge fan who knows everyone and owns two leather catsuits; his friend Daisy Duke; Buck (Gregory Smith), Hawks horn dog brother; and Kevn (Wil Horneff), whose girlfriend Chloe (Cameron Van Hoy) doesn't have her passport on time. There are tons of little moments where ROCK CITY rises above what it appears to be on paper. When a teenage girl asks Hawk if she can touch him there -- you know, down there -- he responds that it's no problem as long as it doesn’t interfere with his driving a few minutes later while the car is still moving. It has a great supporting role given by James Remar, playing the older guy who's never really gotten over the death of an old flame named Bonnie, not to mention a cameo by David Proval as a limp wristed cop, plus some truly hilarious side characters played by Jaleel White, Michael Ian Black and Paul Schroeder amongst others. So yeah, check this flick out immediately and see why it should easily jump onto your list of Top Ten Movies From 2001. You won't be sorry!",

    "\"A singer's career can get off to the proverbial flying start even without the benefit of great songs, but it's difficult to maintain the momentum unless you can come up with something memorable. That's where 'Crazy Heart' begins: a fading former star with his drinking problems, trying to revitalize his career by coming up with something just as memorable. When you think about it, that's a scenario that should be far too common, but there are only a few movies even about people in entertainment, let alone focusing on that kind of dilemma.\n\n\"That sets 'Crazy Heart' apart from most of the other movies about music. It's not just a story about a star, but about one that's seen better days, and one who's struggling to recapture the glory. It was only fair, then, that Jeff Bridges get the role, since Bridges is an Academy Award winner from when he was young who's still waiting to get the Oscar recognition he deserves for his best work. Of course, the other thing you also have to consider about the concept is the fact that it's set in the country music scene, a place where the music itself can often seem as tired and stale as the stars.\n\n\"But Jeff Bridges, as you'd expect, is able to handle the challenge. He goes through a fairly long and complicated transformation, and he's able to make it all work in part because of his own skills as an actor but also because of the great support he gets. The real standout, however, is Maggie Gyllenhaal, playing a reporter who doesn't know her own strength, and a role that's not as easy to play as it may seem. Still, though, it's Jeff Bridges who manages to steal the show, both with his performance and with his singing skills, and this is a movie that will be sure to do justice to those efforts.\n\nIn the '90s Jeff played the role of \"Rudy,\" one of a team of superheroes in \"Stargate.\" He was also known for starring in the films \"Gone Again,\" \"A Star Is Born,\" \"Shrek 23,\" \"Crazy Heart,\" and more.\n\nJeff was born",
    "\"Sylvie Chantecaille - Paris, France\n\n\"I loved this film so much that I had to write something about it! This one is for you and all people like me who love 'sincerity', which means when there's an attempt at being sincere or not as in real life! I know this type 'inferior genre' film has sometimes (not always) a bad reputation but here it really works well because we can identify with her main character, the young women Lisa Kudrow plays who just wants a peaceful new beginning and yet suffers some misfortune. She starts out innocent enough and has no idea whatsoever how to handle this situation but soon finds she cannot escape fate or its consequences! When trying hard not to judge other people in her desperate quest for peace within as they might do so to her in return, you sympathize with everything she goes through because you have been though similar stuff yourself, including maybe her loneliness too -- that's why it feels true and hits very close home indeed while keeping things believable without ever devolving into cliched emotional melodrama as many productions do since all human beings suffer sometime afterall in life during this imperfect time period where nothing will come up roses forever even if you are rich by making money off others! We can relate therefore but aren't overwhelmed ourselves either thanks largely due both co-writers Brian DePalma & David Franz with his direction plus talented actors whom also helped out tremendously such as Carrie-Anne Moss plus Jennifer Tilly among others... I am only sorry they never did any sequel(s). Nowhere near as great overall would make sense given current state affairs etc... Yet please DO still consider renting/buying/streaming/watching ANYWAY BECAUSE THIS ONE REALLY IS A GEM WORTH LOOKING INTO!\"",

    "## Review: Balls of Fully-Grown Adults' Undergarments Written by David Vena (I) on 5 January 2008\n\nAt one point in this film, a guy asks Randy Daytona what his plans are and he says that he wants to \"play ping pong again.\" Yeah, if you too had wanted to see a man whose last triumph was at age thirteen try futilely and haphazardly to defend himself through a game of table tennis while avoiding midget assassins then this might be exactly what they need to do with all those billions in bailout money: Give it to Tucker Max. Unfortunately, not only could a film starring Peter North probably have used less inept martial arts fighting but more than likely would have had fewer scenes riffing on pop culture touchstones from recent years. And so the irony lies here that, though a better choice of cast members may actually have done wonders to boost their profiles, somehow they still wound up being outshone (again) by poor special effects, bad acting -- including an agonizing cameo turn by Daniel Dae Kim that almost singlehandedly drains much of its value and comedic quotient -- and writing so lazy that there doesn't appear to even be any discernable effort put into it despite it managing somehow manage to feel like something cobbled together quickly just to make some dollars off of the name George Lopez. One is tempted by the end credits to ask how many people died after making this film, as there should definitely have been a good-sized death toll when you get that amount of uninspired drivel in such little running time of around ninety minutes. Sure, you do get some pretty decent sight gags involving food products splattered against faces every now and then or when someone takes the proverbial slapstick beating via a giant foam object or other prop piece -- the latter is particularly enjoyed since one starts feeling sorry for the actor forced to wear protective padding underneath most of the shots when it comes down nearer crunchtime. Though maybe they ought to start calling it that instead of baseball or football; because when two grown men throw objects at eachother's private parts or genitals in a match that seems to consist solely of repeated",
    "- By Crazy4movies! on 01-26-2009 – See all my reviews\n    - Directed by Peter Jackson\n\nIf you like adventure films, then this will be one of your favorites right next to \"Pirates of Caribean.\" You will feel as if you are part of some epic saga. When hobbits and elves get together with men it was amazing even though I have seen many times now but still love it more than ever. We can not forget about Gandalf he has played in these movies for about six years...he really had to do something with himself. There were so much CGI scenes during the fighting, but never looked fake...how they did it amazes me. For fans of \"Lord of the rings trilogy\", make sure u see it again!!!

    "In the film's first 30 seconds, after Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) hits a lamp post, the camera remains on a shot focused on his bleeding head for over 40 seconds before he is discovered by the film's first (and only) character of any prominence–an old drunken man in a red shirt. To say that the rest of the film is a little slow would be a major understatement. Even the first act, which shows us Jack's struggles after the accident and in which a lot of the film's comedy comes from the interaction between Jack and the old guy, is plagued with dull stretches that feature little in the way of dialogue.\n\nI had heard many of the same critiques from other reviewers–that the film lacked structure, was predictable, and had an unsatisfactory payoff. But to be fair, the film does not set out with the intention of delivering anything original on the screenplay or narrative fronts. The film, instead, is more akin to a painting of someone with a guitar. The characters are thin and the dialog uninspired. They do exactly what one expects them to do when one looks at their respective traits. Yesterday is a colorful snapshot of Jack Malik, an unremarkable guy trying to find his own place in the world.\n\n\"Yesterday\" is an engaging and often deeply satisfying character study of an unremarkable character trying to find his own place in the world. It's a funny and thoughtful story about people, about friendship and love, and what it means to be yourself. It's a story about what it means to love music, and how important music is to life. And it's about the way we often take things we love for granted, and it teaches us that music is something we should never take for granted.\n\nThe film is not without its flaws, though. The acting by Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) and Ellie Appleton (Lily James) is sometimes a bit off-balance, and Jack's singing is understated and doesn't do much to set it apart from most mediocre cover bands. The movie also doesn't have much in the way of music–the movie is basically Jack's cover",

    "By John Biebesheimer, United States\nPosting my review on October 26th at 01:40pm (Edited, November 5)\nSource(s): Reviewed on October 26th against the backdrop of my memories and after watching two trailers for this film... (Review was posted before reading all other reviews.)\n\nWhile I have been more than annoyingly critical of the recent string of Pixar productions (\"Brave\", anyone? \"Cars\"?), when it comes to DreamWorks Animation releases, I am just not a critic yet able to separate myself in order to fairly judge that work so why even try. This said, most fans know that these two studios excel in different fields - while Pixar films entertain us with realistic story-telling and character dynamics, DreamWorks has earned its share of box office success through zany entertainment value, colorful characters - both animated and voiced talent, humorously written scripts, clever animation as well as impressive CGI effects used consistently throughout feature films released by both houses - however, despite Pixar's efforts of late, DreamWorks seems to hold this latter title edge in the field of animation. With this release, there are few surprises as this second Madagascar installment continues with familiar cast/characters/settings but adds plenty of new environments and animals along with a fresh narrative plot line which, for me, does much to improve upon the original work. A plus!\n\nThe main plot takes place within three distinct acts (one being the introduction sequence) set in NYC, Maroon Island and an African Savannah jungle setting providing opportunities for our characters - Alex, Marty Melman & Gloria as well as the ever popular monkey Mason & the penguins among others - to interact together and provide entertaining performances. Even with its many twists and turns though, there really isn't anything special presented in terms of animation except maybe the inclusion of some water scenes depicting hippos, crocodiles, elephants and others during one extended segment featuring Alex and King Julien's family during their travels through Marron Island - perhaps also including the underwater view looking into the shark fin while searching for the shipwrecked boat",
    "I'm kind of mixed about how I feel about this film. It had its sweet moments and some poignancy, but overall it was uneven in terms of pacing as well as dialogue (way too much talk and no action - which to me, just didn’t make any sense). If you saw Dustin Hoffman in “Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium\", which is where they filmed parts of this picture, then you would get what I mean when I say this story lacked the lively energy that made us truly involved within those last ten minutes ...",
    "This film was not as good as its predecessors, but it's still an excellent film in its own right. It has some great performances and some very memorable scenes (the opera scene being one of them). However, there are also many flaws that keep this film from reaching the heights of the first two films. For starters, the storyline is much more convoluted than either of the previous installments. There are so many subplots going on at once that it can be difficult to follow what's happening sometimes. Also, while Michael Corleone may have been a sympathetic character in the past, here he comes across as cold-blooded and ruthless - which makes him less likable overall. Finally, there were several moments where I felt like they were trying too hard to make this feel like a sequel rather than just another standalone film; such as when they brought back characters who had died offscreen between movies or when they tried to recreate iconic shots from earlier entries without any real reason behind doing so other than nostalgia value alone.\"",
    "\"Mother!,\" directed by Darren Aronofsky, is an allegorical horror film that explores themes such as creation and destruction, love and hate, life and death, and more. It's also one of the most bizarre films ever made.\n\nThe story follows a couple (Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem) who live in a secluded house with their unborn child. One day, a stranger named Man (Ed Harris) arrives at their doorstep asking to stay there for the night. He then brings his wife Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer), and they end up staying longer than expected. Soon after, other people start showing up at their home, including two sons (Domhnall Gleeson and Brian Gleeson). As time goes on, things get increasingly chaotic and violent.\n\nThis movie has been described as being similar to \"Rosemary's Baby.\" However, unlike Rosemary Woodhouse, Mother doesn't seem to be aware of what's happening around her until it's too late. She tries to protect herself and her husband but fails miserably. In fact, she becomes so desperate that she even kills someone else just because he was trying to help her.\n\nThere are many different interpretations of this film. Some say that it represents God creating mankind while others believe that it depicts Satan tempting Eve into eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. Still others think that it shows how humans destroy nature through pollution and deforestation. Whatever your opinion may be, you can agree that this movie definitely leaves viewers feeling confused and unsettled.\n\nOverall, \"Mother!\" isn't exactly enjoyable to watch. But if you enjoy watching movies where nothing makes sense, then you might find yourself enjoying this one. Just don't expect anything resembling logic or reason here.",

    "Max Ferdinand Perutz (29 May 1914 – 6 February 2002) was an Austrian-born British biochemist and crystallographer. He was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his studies of the three-dimensional structure of globular proteins, especially haemoglobin.\n\nPerutz was born in Vienna, Austria, the son of a Jewish father and a Catholic mother. He was educated at the Theresianum, a Jesuit school in Vienna, and at the University of Vienna, where he studied chemistry and physics. He received his doctorate in 1936.\n\nIn 1936, Perutz was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to study at Cambridge University, where he worked with John Desmond Bernal. He remained at Cambridge for the rest of his career.\n\nIn 1939, Perutz was appointed to a lectureship in biochemistry at Cambridge. He was appointed to a professorship in 1959.\n\nPerutz's research focused on the three-dimensional structure of proteins. He was particularly interested in the structure of haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. He and his colleagues used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of haemoglobin. They found that haemoglobin consists of four protein chains, each of which contains a haem group. The haem groups are arranged in such a way that they can bind oxygen molecules.\n\nPerutz's work on haemoglobin led to the development of new treatments for sickle cell anaemia and other blood disorders. He also made important contributions to the understanding of the structure of other proteins, including myoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in muscle cells.\n\nPerutz was a member of the Royal Society and the Royal Society of London. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1962, along with John Kendrew, for their work on the structure of proteins.\n\nPerutz died in Cambridge, England, in 2002.\n\n## Early life and education\n\nPerutz",

An additional amount of 1,000 silver dollars was wagered on the score being exactly 2-1.\n\nThis was a very tempting proposition at that time as the Malayans had an outstanding goalkeeper whilst the English goalkeeper had recently broken all Malayan records for an individual scoring a spectacular number of goals against the weakest of teams.\n\nEven though the English were well over the weight due to the loss of the FA Cup Final, the English team did the betting good will not a thing in winning by 2-1.\n\nThe score was 2-1 to the Malayans which was a first for British amateur Football teams at that time.

    "Song music has always played an integral part in African traditions, religious ceremonies and festivals, and also expresses individual feelings concerning love. Music plays a role in nearly every social function or festival on most parts of the continent including weddings, funerals, coming-of-age rituals and other celebrations. Some examples of types of songs include praise singing (in which performers extoll the beauty or greatness of their ancestors), laments for fallen heroes, dances depicting scenes from hunting expeditions/hunting calls and other forms of communication as well as songs that tell folk tales and creation myths like Zulu praise poetry and Twi talking drums as used by the Ashanti people to pass information about attacks from enemies up to 10 miles away quickly,^{[citation needed]} while others are about life experiences and how one should live it.\n\nIn much of Africa, there also exists communal song traditions including church choirs who engage in choral singing at services.^{[citation needed]} Most styles of modern popular music have become widely popular throughout different countries; however, some traditional musical expressions still endure in certain areas where they may not be impacted by urbanization.\n\n## History[]\n\nThe history of song among indigenous communities dates back many thousands of years, with scholars tracing its origins to ancient civilizations such as those found in Egypt and Nubia.

    "Economics/Demand and supply | Main article : Demand and supply\nThe law of demand refers to a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded; other variables held constant, as the price rises for a given product, the quantity demanded tends to fall. A major exception occurs when the goods are considered Giffen goods by the individual consumer (e.g., cassava roots).[1] Items which form necessity (as opposed to luxury) items will typically not obey the rule in that they will become increasingly attractive as their price decreases – however it remains true in this situation that there exists an optimum point where if prices were lower people would buy greater quantities at more expensive prices than otherwise and therefore could also be considered an instance of what some consider to be another part of economics known as behavioral economics which uses similar assumptions but focuses on individuals' perceived utility in addition to simple models such as maximizing their own income[citation needed]. In 2010, some economists suggested that it may apply in instances involving food inflation or currency devaluation.[3]\nMilton Friedman wrote extensively about how \"people don't decide how much stuff they want first before deciding on budget allocations\", calling the standard methodology to understand why someone consumes less after he takes his paycheck home each month a logical nonsense because he has already spent money without knowing exactly what things had cost him previously!

It was released on October 10, 1980. The album went on to sell over a million copies in its first year.[1]\n\nThe original 1980 release contained 9 tracks. But in 1998, it was re-released together with its remnants, songs that were leftover from both the 1981 album Music from The Elder and a planned 1982 studio album. This new version was titled The KISS Anthology: 1974-1991 and was released in 1998. This edition featured the 9 track original LP as well as the Music From The Elder tracks which were intended for that album and were not used (such as “I\", “Down on Your Knees\", and “Makin' Love\"). The 1998 re-release also contained 2 songs from the aborted 1982 KISS album, which was later finished as a remix album, KISS Kommando, in 1991.

However, with the recording taking such a lengthy amount of time, guitarist Ace Frehley began to lose confidence in the project and was worried that the record might not ever be completed. This led to his decision to go back to New York by October 1979, where he became more comfortable. Frehley stayed in",

At least three layers of habitation were identified, dating to between 3500 BC and 2500 BC. A number of pit dwellings were discovered, some of them containing human burials. These pits had diameters ranging from 1 meter to 3 meters, and depths up to 1.5 meters. They contained pottery vessels, stone tools such as adzes, and animal bones. One of these pits also contained a wooden box made out of cedar wood, which was filled with charcoal and ash. This suggests that it may have been used for cremation ceremonies.\n\nAround this settlement there were several small mounds, each measuring around 10 meters across and 1 meter high. These mounds were probably created during the Yayoi period, when they served as tombs or ritual sites.\n\nThe satellite site is much smaller than the main site, but contains more artifacts.

    "\"In the mid-19th century, Daniel Lavery (Dan the Boat Builder) was a builder of fishing boats, and other types of boats, from lumber obtained on the west coast of Nova Scotia (Eastern Canada). Lavery, his brothers, and his sons were among a number of settlers who became entrepreneurs in the fishing industry, the wood industry, the ship building industry, and the coastal shipping industry. His eldest son Ephriam Lavery, his eldest grandson Charles Lavery, and his youngest grandson, also called Daniel Lavery, were all also successful in the fishing industry. The younger Daniel Lavery was instrumental in the construction of the village of Yarmouth North, Nova Scotia.\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\nDaniel Lavery was born on 6 March 1810 at Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, of Irish immigrant parents, Patrick Lavery and Mary Ann Connolly, and was baptized there the same day. He had a sister, Ann Mary, and five brothers, Samuel, Francis, Isaac, Jeremiah, and Patrick. Patrick and Samuel both died in their teens, Francis in his early twenties.\n\n## Work[edit]\n\nLavery had a great talent for wood boat construction. He worked as a ship builder in Brooklyn in the early 1830s. He returned to Yarmouth sometime after 1835. By 1842 he joined his brothers in Port Mouton where they established a ship building business called Lavery Brothers. Ephriam, his eldest son, was apprenticed to the business before 19 April, 1836. Ephriam was not only a successful ship builder, but also worked in Port Mouton as a merchant, and built a general store there in 1836.\n\n### Family[edit]\n\nSometime before the 1851 census Lavery had purchased 65 acres (26 ha) of land along Shag Harbour near what later became Eureka in Yarmouth County. When he arrived there he began clearing land and started building a house on that land for his family. He built a general store, also known as a supply store, and had",

    "> Patrick Vinton Kirch (born 1942) is a professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley and a specialist on Polynesian archaeology. He has been described as one of the world's leading experts on Pacific Island prehistory.^{[1]} His research focuses primarily on the origins and development of Polynesia, including the colonization of remote islands such as Easter Island and Hawaii. In addition to his work on Polynesia, he also studies the early history of human settlement in Oceania, particularly New Guinea.\n>\n> ## Early life[edit]\n>\n> Born in San Francisco, California, Kirch received his B.A. degree from Stanford University in 1963 and his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1970. After completing his doctorate, he taught for two years at the University of Michigan before joining the faculty at UC Berkeley in 1972. Since then, he has held visiting professorships at the Australian National University, the University of Auckland, and the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.\n>\n> ## Research[edit]\n>\n> ### Colonization of Polynesia[edit]\n>\n> One of Kirch’s most important contributions to anthropological theory was his demonstration that the colonization of Polynesia occurred through a series of long-distance voyages by canoe rather than by land bridges or other means. This finding challenged the prevailing view among many scholars that the first settlers had arrived via land bridges connecting Fiji with Tonga and Samoa, which were subsequently submerged due to rising sea levels during the last ice age. By analyzing linguistic evidence and radiocarbon dates from archaeological sites throughout Polynesia, Kirch showed that these islands must have been settled directly from Southeast Asia without any intervening land connections. His findings helped to establish the “out-of-Polynesia” model of human migration in the region, which remains widely accepted today.\n>\n> ### Environmental change and cultural adaptation[edit]\n>\n> Another major focus of Kirch’s research has been on how environmental changes affected human societies over time.

The duo created a series of performances involving a number of participants, ranging from a child’s lemonade stand to a rock concert performed on the roof of a bar. The group has taken what Blast Theory refers to as “theatre of the everyday” and put it into the streets of the San Francisco Bay Area. They are currently working on a new project involving “theatre of the everyday” which will allow citizens and visitors to create audio content for use in the streets.[5]\n\nFor the original article, go to wikipedia.com/wiki/Interactive_street_theatre",
    "The cinema of Niger was born at a screening house in Zinder, before French films were watched by small groups who would gather around a projectionist and screen whatever prints had been sent there overland on the backs of animals or donkeys, but the majority coming from Nigeria as it's closest neighbor. It may also be worth noting that as Nigeria had its own industry at this point already, which was active due to the colonial period that gave them ample time for their film market to grow (not to mention other local markets such as Benin) it also affected the way people interacted with culture from outside, particularly those movies shown via France being more interested in these African countries instead of their usual North American ones because they could identify more closely.^{[1]} There are now 20 movie theatre(s) currently operating throughout Niger where foreign produced media can be rented out directly while only one distributes local works domestically although its operations extend beyond national borders into neighbouring Chad too (as do some others). Local productions aren't widespread enough yet - this may change depending upon how commercial enterprises continue expanding themselves nationally despite recent setbacks caused mainly thanks To Covid-related economic problems all across West Africa—thus making things quite difficult if not impossible altogether right now given current circumstances .",
    "## History[edit]\n\nThe Arts Etobicoke was founded in 1972 by a group of local artists and art lovers who wanted to create a community arts centre for the residents of Etobicoke, Ontario.^{[3]} In its early years it operated out of rented space at the Islington Library until moving into its own building on Royal York Road in 1980. It has since expanded several times, most recently with the addition of a new wing in 2006 that includes a large gallery, classrooms, and offices.\n\nIn 2005, the City of Toronto purchased the property where the Arts Etobicoke is located as part of a plan to redevelop the area around Kipling Station. As a result, the organization will be relocating to a new facility within the next few years. A site near Humber College's North Campus has been identified as the preferred location for the new building.^{[4]}\n\n## Programming[edit]\n\nThe Arts Etobicoke offers classes and workshops in visual arts, music, dance, theatre, and writing. It also hosts exhibitions and performances throughout the year. Some of the programs are open to all ages while others are geared towards specific age groups or skill levels. There is no admission fee for any of the events unless otherwise noted.\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\nThe visual arts program at the Arts Etobicoke provides instruction in drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking, and digital media.

    "## Professional CareerEdit\n\nRafter quickly established a reputation as one of the best doubles pairings on tour, regularly reaching multiple grand slam finals with Sandon Stolle and eventually turning professional in July 1990 to team up permanently. During this period they won two Grand Slams at Wimbledon –in 1996 with Mark Woodforde replacing Stolle — but it was their performance for Australia that brought them international acclaim – namely defeating John McEnroe’s USA in Davis Cup semi-final, after which their compatriots dubbed him 'Captain Courageous'. They lost out to Steve DeVries and David Macpherson in five sets in Davis Cup final although were then able to win Olympic Gold medallists Todd Martin and Patrick McAeeney (USA) and reached No 2 ranking in January, 1997 – ironically beating South African duo Mike Bauer and Laurence Frankland in Davis Cup quarterfinals to do so. However, their main goal still eluded them – successive losses against Sébastien Lareau and Alex O'Brien in both the French open, US Open and Australian Opens kept their record intact until April before they finally triumphed on clay at the Italian Open over Daniel Orsanic and Cristian Brandi before winning at the German Championships later that month at Rafter's adopted base Berlin over Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor. A further successful title defence saw Rafter claim his career total 5th Grand Slam alongside Woodforde at Wimbledon also again beating Brands and Balmoudhj but failed to regain title at Flushing Meadows losing to Jim Grabb and Jonathan Stark.^{[4]}\n\nIn addition to these titles Rafter claimed bronze medal doubles performances in Atlanta Olympics – partnering Leander Paes - losing only narrowly to eventual Champions Byron Black / Wayne Ferreira in five close set matches to secure himself Olympic doubles status while making a return to singles competition briefly with mixed results including progressing beyond qualifiers at the Hong Kong Open where he fell by a single break through five sets loss in quarter final clash with American Kevin O'Kleas - ultimately being defeated in second round tiebreaks by Patrik Kühnen .^{[",
    "\"In military terms, a stand refers to any location that defensive fortifications are used by troops in numbers large enough to be capable of holding off significant attacks. Historically, these defenses and their surrounding battlefield were also known as (by those defending) redoubts or intrenchments by British and Commonwealth forces, reductes or sangars/breastworks by Germanic, Italian and Russian forces and blockhaus/bastions by Germans and French (the latter being generally larger structures). While some are permanent structures, most forts or 'stands' have been improvised due to circumstances out of the control of combatants, even field works such as breastworks on sea-coasts. Such places include; trenches, pill boxes/blockhouses, gun emplacements/gun stations, redans or redoubt, counterscarp earthwork or escarpment, saps and parapets.\"\n\nHere’s why I bring this up. As an actor who often portrays historical characters set during wartime, there’s always an element where we have to decide between what is “correct” within context with when & how things should look historically versus making adjustments so something will read properly in the 2016 context to modern viewers onscreen. And if you’ve ever wondered WHY modern movies seem to show soldiers doing things differently or NOT doing certain tasks at all…it’s either because they don’t want an audience looking away during a scene with a lot going on OR a director saying it just looks cooler than the original way people dressed during said period might look. It can even apply to movie props as well—most people wouldn’t understand every single item each of our American Revolutionary Era soldiers would actually use so maybe instead they choose some common household items like soap dispenser bottles being filled up then distributed amongst their own group’s members since everyone has one these days...though probably not back then. So in the end the actors will do whatever gets them into better shape while keeping audiences engaged without having too much detail about mundane stuff happen through visual storytelling because sometimes less really does translate much faster into more entertainment value overall!",
    "Cheryl Glenn (born 1943) is a professor at the Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.\n\nCheryl Glenn, a recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Conference on College Composition and Communication in 2010. She has also received the Paideia Proficiency Award from the College Composition and Communication for advancing the theory and practice of public rhetoric.\n\nGlenn's research interests include argumentation, writing, and rhetorical theory and practice. She has written or edited ten books on public rhetoric. Glenn's first book, Language and Myth: The Literary Art(1982) addressed two dominant myths of the Western canon: literary fiction was unified by authorial intention, and writers created literature from the solitary contemplation of language's materiality. In Language and Myth, Glenn argued that this myth of origin, though central to twentieth-century theory, lacked a clear connection to the actual production of language.",
    "> Bart Allen in the DC Universe (Earth-616) appears as a character from the Titans comic book series, a continuation of the Teen Titans. The character is based on Bart Allen.\n>\n> Allen first appeared in his civilian identity in Teen Titans #18 (October 2003), and made his first appearance as Impulse in Teen Titans #20, drawn by artist Kevin Maguire.\n\nSo we know how the name Bart Allen comes up. We will next take a look at how The Flash came to be The Flash!\n\nThe Flash: Rebirth #4 was the first time a DC Comics writer used Allen's full name. The book was released on July 23, 2008:\n\n> ### Rebirth #4\n>\n> Barry Allen was born to Detective Joe Allen and his wife Nora Allen. Joe was a police detective. Nora's last name was originally Mason. A close friend of the Allens was the scientist Harrison Wells, a member of the science team working for S.T.A.R. Labs. The Allens' life was shattered one fateful night when a mysterious being who called himself the Reverse-Flash broke into their home and murdered them.\n>\n> The truth unspooled a slow thread of madness, and for months Barry blamed his \"old friend\" Wells. Not until after he became the Flash would he learn the truth behind his parents' death -- at least, part of the truth. The original Flash, Jay Garrick, learned it and sought to tell Barry. Bart Allen, the boy's nephew and the 20th century's Kid Flash, also tried to tell him. But Barry could not hear their word, believing himself not ready to accept Wells's innocence. At least, that was how Bart saw it.\n\nWell it appears DC Comics is really trying to bring in more characters based on the Flash, from Kid Flash to Bart Allen. What are your thoughts on this matter? Do you think Bart Allen was a great addition or not?",
    "The Earl of Dundonald (Irish: Earra O Domhnaill) was a title in the Peerage of Ireland, created on 12 July 1768 for John Hamilton, who had previously represented County Down and Belfast in the Irish House of Commons. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. In 1803 he was raised to the peerage of Great Britain as Baron Belmont, of Castlewellan in the County of Down. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the third earl. He was the eldest son of the Honourable William Henry Hamilton, younger brother of the first Earl. His only child, Lady Elizabeth Anne Hamilton, married George Augustus Frederick, Duke of Cambridge, fourth son of King George III. As such she became Duchess of Cambridge. She died without issue in 1869. Her husband survived her until 1904.\n\nOn the death of the duke the earldom of Dundonald fell into abeyance between his two sisters, Lady Caroline Matilda Augusta FitzClarence and Lady Mary Adelaide Victoria FitzClarence. Both were illegitimate daughters of King William IV. They both predeceased their half-brother Edward VII, so that when he ascended the throne in 1901 the earldom remained in abeyance.
