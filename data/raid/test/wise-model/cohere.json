    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type. This\ndevelops work of Uhlenbeck, Segal, and Burstall-Guest to non-compact inner\nsymmetric spaces. To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity. This provides a straightforward way to construct all such harmonic\nmaps.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",
    "Deep neural networks have achieved satisfactory performance in piles of\nmedical image analysis tasks. However the training of deep neural network\nrequires a large amount of samples with high-quality annotations. In medical\nimage segmentation, it is very laborious and expensive to acquire precise\npixel-level annotations. Aiming at training deep segmentation models on\ndatasets with probably corrupted annotations, we propose a novel Meta Corrupted\nPixels Mining (MCPM) method based on a simple meta mask network. Our method is\ntargeted at automatically estimate a weighting map to evaluate the importance\nof every pixel in the learning of segmentation network. The meta mask network\nwhich regards the loss value map of the predicted segmentation results as\ninput, is capable of identifying out corrupted layers and allocating small\nweights to them. An alternative algorithm is adopted to train the segmentation\nnetwork and the meta mask network, simultaneously. Extensive experimental\nresults on LIDC-IDRI and LiTS datasets show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches which are devised for coping with corrupted\nannotations.",

    "  It is an important task to faithfully evaluate the perceptual quality of\noutput images in many applications such as image compression, image restoration\nand multimedia streaming. A good image quality assessment (IQA) model should\nnot only deliver high quality prediction accuracy but also be computationally\nefficient. The efficiency of IQA metrics is becoming particularly important due\nto the increasing proliferation of high-volume visual data in high-speed\nnetworks. We present a new effective and efficient IQA model, called gradient\nmagnitude similarity deviation (GMSD). The image gradients are sensitive to\nimage distortions, while different local structures in a distorted image suffer\ndifferent degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore the use of\nglobal variation of gradient based local quality map for overall image quality\nprediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity (GMS)\nbetween the reference and distorted images combined with a novel pooling\nstrategy the standard deviation of the GMS map can predict accurately\nperceptual image quality.

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic. Edges are constructed by\ndividing image into different catchment basins with the help of a membership\nfunction. Finally closed contour algorithm is applied to find closed regions\nand objects within closed regions are segmented using intensity information.\nThe performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated both objectively as well\nas subjectively.

For comparative analysis, various comparison\nmethods are used for demonstrating the superiority of proposed methods over\nexisting segmentation methods.",
    "  The effects of residual amplitude modulation (RAM) in laser interferometers\nusing heterodyne sensing can be substantial and difficult to mitigate. In this\nwork, we analyze the effects of RAM on a complex laser interferometer used for\ngravitational wave detection.

This shift causes variations in\nthe sensing matrix, and leads to degradation in the performance of the\nprecision noise subtraction scheme of the multiple-degree-of-freedom control\nsystem. In addition, such detuned optical cavities produce an opto-mechanical\nspring, which also varies the sensing matrix.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

To efficiently process video, we propose 3D separable\nconvolution for the pyramid pooling module and decoder, which dramatically\nreduces the number of operations while maintaining the performance. Moreover,\nwe also extend our framework to video action segmentation by adding an extra\nclassifier to predict the action label for actors in videos.

Our generative\nadversarial network based model works on a conditional probability approach.\nThis approach makes the image translation independent of any local, global and\ncontent or style features. In our approach we use a bidirectional\nreconstruction model appended with the affine transform factor that helps in\nconserving the content and photorealism as compared to other models. The\nadvantage of using such an approach is that the image-to-image translation is\nsemi-supervised, independant of image segmentation and inherits the properties\nof generative adversarial networks tending to produce realistic. This method\nhas proven to produce better results than Multimodal Unsupervised\nImage-to-image translation.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets. It also\noutperforms state-of-the-art edge detection methods on NYU depth dataset and\nachieves state-of-the-art on Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS 500).",
    "Current state-of-the-art methods for image segmentation form a dense image\nrepresentation where the color, shape and texture information are all processed\ntogether inside a deep CNN. This however may not be ideal as they contain very\ndifferent type of information relevant for recognition. Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes benchmark, in terms of both mask\n(mIoU) and boundary (F-score) quality, improving by 2% and 4% over strong\nbaselines.",
    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions. Our proof confirms recent numerical findings that already\nhinted at this convergence. Furthermore we offer a thorough mathematical\nunderpinning for networks of so-called theta neurons, where the OA ansatz has\njust been applied. In a final step we extend our proof by allowing for\ntime-dependent and multi-dimensional parameters as well as for network\ntopologies other than global coupling. This renders the OA ansatz an excellent\nstarting point for the analysis of a broad class of realistic settings.\n",
    "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the non-invasive modality of choice for\nbody tissue composition analysis due to its excellent soft tissue contrast and\nlack of ionizing radiation.

When she thinks her two children do not need her any longer, Lila Schwartz, a sexually active woman, leaves behind her family, calls herself Lila Munroe and moves to California, where she trains, and later works, as a lawyer. Faced with the dual challenge of having to raise two teenage kids while remaining successful in his demanding job as a publicist and speech writer, Bernard Schwartz more and more relies on medication to cope with everyday life. The real trouble begins when he accidentally swallows two incompatible antidepressants and falls into a coma shortly thereafter. While he is unconscious Bernard Schwartz has a stroke. When he wakes up again he is seriously handicapped&mdash;his speech is slurred, his walk is unsteady and his memory is permanently impaired. Similar to a child, he has to learn the meanings of many words. Instead of going to school, Chris teaches his father as best as he can. In spite of his enforced preoccupation with his \"sleeping\" father, Chris Schwartz notices that his own life goes on without any major change. Still a virgin, he fantasizes about having sex with Lisa Danmeyer, Bernard's neurologist and actually has his first sexual encounter ever at his father's rehab centre with a sexy speech pathologist who performs fellatio on him. At the same time Cathy, his 16 year-old sister, is on the brink of abandoning her Jewish roots and converting to Roman Catholicism. However, she also develops a crush on Francis Dial, her brother's best friend and classmate. Chris cannot believe that his younger sister might have sex before he does, but in the end this is exactly what happens, an unwanted teenage pregnancy being the result of their union. At first the young lovers are unsure whether Cathy should have an abortion or not, but Cathy soon makes up her mind to keep the baby.",
    " The school has been run since its inception ten years earlier by two elderly educators, Mabel Edge and Hermione Baker, who are regarded by many as old spinsters hopelessly out of touch with reality, especially with what their teenage charges really think and feel. The 300 or so students are virtually indistinguishable from one another, a fact which is stressed by their names all starting with the letter M: Margot, Marion, Mary, Melissa, Merode, Midget, Mirabel, Moira. Their budding but suppressed sexuality&mdash;they are all between 16 and 18 years of age and \"going to be attractive\"&mdash;is constantly alluded to in the novel. (\"They're only children, the girls I mean, and sex is unconscious at their age. It's such a temptation for a man.\") Of the teaching staff, only few characters are mentioned. There is Miss Winstanley, young, colourless, and secretly in love with one of the few male teachers at the academy, economics tutor Sebastian Birt. Birt, however, a short and stout man in his late twenties, is having an affair with Elizabeth Rock, a 35 year-old woman recovering from a nervous breakdown who temporarily also lives on the school grounds, in her grandfather's cottage. That man, 76 year-old Mr Rock, is a retired scientist who has been granted the privilege to live there for the remainder of his life for past services rendered to the State. The aging Rock, who is referred to as \"the sage\" by some (including the narrator) and as \"Gapa\" by his granddaughter, spends his time mainly with, and for, his pets&mdash;his albino sow, Daisy, his cat, Alice, and his goose, Ted. He describes himself as \"a bit stiff about the joints these days\", he has some difficulty climbing steps, has poor eyesight, is deaf in one ear and almost deaf in the other, and has recently had problems with his memory. In addition, one of his idiosyncrasies consists in putting all the post he gets in a big trunk without opening any of it, ever. Edge, one of the principals, has for some time wanted to thoroughly \"spring-clean\" the whole place and get rid of Rock, his granddaughter, and Birt, partly in order to secure the sage's cottage for the use of additional school staff. In other matters, she is more hesitant. When in the morning some girls report Mary and Merode missing, pointing out that neither of their beds has been slept in, Edge turns out to be very reluctant to use the official channels to inform relatives, the school supervisor, or the local police. Naturally it occurs to her and her colleague Baker that Mary and Merode might have eloped with two young men (\"At the station much of their time was taken up with young women adrift, who, after fourteen days, returned brown and happy from a fortnight with a boy by the ocean.\"), but, rather than fearing the worst, they assume the girls will be back for that night's entertainment, a ball in honour of the academy's founder&mdash;without men of course. At the same time Edge turns down some of the staff's requests to be allowed to go swimming in the nearby lake, which is interpreted as a sure sign that one of the girls' bodies could turn up any time floating in the water. In the course of the day, especially where Rock is involved, lots of people talk at cross-purposes, deliberately as well as accidentally misunderstanding what others are saying, in many instances only hinting at facts or, worse, spreading rumours. Around noon Merode is found, right on the compound but somewhat dazed, under a fallen beech in the vicinity of Rock's cottage&mdash;the very beech tree used by Sebastian Birt and Elizabeth Rock when they want to have some fun. According to school regulations, Merode must not be interrogated before she has submitted a written statement about what has happened, and she is immediately locked away for her own good. The rest of the afternoon is mainly taken up with preparations for the dance. As usual, the Founder's Day Ball is held without any guests from outside the school. However, Rock and his granddaughter turn up unexpectedly but appropriately dressed, without having been invited by anyone. While Mary is still missing (the reader never learns where she is or what has happened to her), Elizabeth Rock and Sebastian Birt start dancing together cheek to cheek and, generally, appear glued to each other, a \"display of animalism\" Edge is not willing to put up with any longer. Almost at the end of her tether, she secretly indulges in a cigarette or two in her office. Meanwhile Mr Rock is accosted by several of the girls who first want to dance with him and later drag him downstairs into the cellar of the building where they take turns kissing him and where they introduce him to the \"Institute Inn\", their secret club. Although Rock initially enjoys the girls' attentions, he quickly becomes appalled by their lack of morals and leaves the \"club.\" He comes upon his nemesis, Miss Edge, but after his experiences with the girls he is more sympathetic to her difficulties maintaining order at the school. For her part, Edge is impressed with the courtly bearing Rock has affected in the Ball's formal setting and also consumed by a tobacco-fueled lassitude. The two older adults have a pleasant conversation which comes to a head when Edge, almost without realizing, finds herself proposing marriage to Rock. The sage is astounded, and politely but firmly rejects her suggestion. He then leaves the ball and returns home to his animals. At the end of the day no one has reached any conclusions, and everything remains undecided.",

The principal claims that she did this to ensure they were wearing proper attire for the school dance. She also claims that her job is not only to ensure they get a proper education, but that they also grow into proper ladies and do not become sluts. She sends several girls home for wearing slutty panties. Although there is no crime to charge her with, Jesse determines to make trouble for her until he can find something to charge her with as he is convinced the girls’ civil rights were violated. He begins interviewing the principal along with her high powered attorney husband, as well as the girls. Later one of the girls comes to see Jesse at his office. She tells him that her parents are swingers, and often host parties for that purpose at their home. She and her little brother hate it and she asks Jesse if he can help. With swinging not illegal, Jesse finds his hands tied, but decides to investigate anyway. He has Suit talk to two of the women, one of whom he knew in high school, to get more information on the swingers club. Suit discovers that the girl’s mother is not into it, but only does it because her husband wants to. Jesse has Spike threaten her husband about the swinging, and she later leaves him. The main plot of the novel involves the investigation of the Night Hawk. The Night Hawk starts as a peeping tom, and the Paradise police get several calls about him. Later the Night Hawk escalates his voyeuristic attacks by breaking into homes while women are home alone, forcing them to undress at gunpoint, and then taking nude photos of them. He then begins writing Jesse detailing his exploits, and includes the nude photos. He writes that he cannot stop himself; he must discover these women’s “secret.” He also writes that he does not know what he will do next and fears that he will escalate further. Jesse begins to combine his investigation of the swingers with his investigation of the Night Hawk. Since the Night Hawk never touches anyone, he questions the swingers to find out if there is anyone in their club that only likes to watch and never touch. The women in the club all identify Seth Ralston. Ralston is a professor of English at a nearby university. He is married to a young grad student who is working on her doctorate. Jesse discovers that Ralston's wife used to teach a Wednesday night class, which corresponds with all the peeping tom reports. He also discovers that the peeping tom reports stopped at the same time that Ralston’s wife quit her teaching job to begin doing her doctoral work full time. Jesse questions Ralston’s wife about the swinging to see if she will inadvertently reveal something about her husband that will confirm he is the Night Hawk, and even hints to her that her husband may be the Night Hawk. She responds by belittling Jesse for being a dumb cop, and singling them out for their lifestyle. Meanwhile Jesse continues to pressure Betsy Ingersoll, who then reports that she is a victim of the Night Hawk. Soon after Jesse receives a nude photo of Betsy, however he and Molly become convinced that she is posing in the photo and suspect the attack was staged. The local media request an interview concerning the attack, and Jesse uncharacteristically agrees. He gives details of the attack and later receives a letter from the Night Hawk who demands that he never attacked Betsy Ingersoll. Jesse believes that the Night Hawk is telling the truth, as he has never denied an attack before, but always been honest about his attacks. Jesse confronts Betsy with this and she admits that she staged the attack. She says that she did it to get some attention from her husband, but that he did not even care. She was acting out because her husband cheats on her constantly with young women, which also explains her obsession with teenage girls not growing up to be sluts. Jesse agrees not to charge her with any crimes if she agrees to see Sunny Randall’s shrink, Dr. Silverman (the long-term love interest of another Parker character Spenser), which she does. A few days later Seth Ralston’s wife comes to Jesse to report that her husband is missing. They begin searching for him, and soon after Jesse receives another letter from the Night Hawk blasting him for speaking with his wife, and ruining his life. He writes that he is going to leave town, but only after he discovers one more woman’s secret, as he calls it, and warns that this woman will be someone close to Jesse. Jesse thinks that he is trying to hint that the woman will be Betsy Ingersoll, but Jesse believes he is actually targeting Molly. They set a police unit in front of Betsy’s house as a decoy, but then stake out Molly’s house. Molly waits at home with a gun strapped to her thigh, and a wire so Jesse can hear her. The Night Hawk breaks in on her and forces her to begin stripping at gun point. Suit and Jesse then break in to arrest him. Surprised that they figured out he was after Molly, he raises his gun to shoot her, but Molly, Suit, and Jesse all shoot and kill Seth Ralston, putting an end to the Night Hawk. Suit is left with a moral dilemma that it was his shot that killed Ralston, but since all three fired, Jesse is able to disfuse the situation by convincing Suit that it could have been any one of the three.",
    " The story outlines contact between Earth and the title Visitors, a group of mysterious objects from deep space. The Visitors are simple black oblong boxes, as large as buildings, which approach from space and orbit the Earth before descending to the United States. The nature of the visitors is kept rather mysterious&nbsp;— it's not clear if they are vehicles or living things in their own right. They are apparently unable to communicate with humans in any meaningful way; on one occasion a human is taken inside a Visitor, only to be released after experiencing a jumble of confusing colored lights and smells which he didn't understand. The Visitors are composed largely of a dense form of cellulose, and they proceed to consume a quantity of trees and plant life in the US. Eventually they start producing vehicles, superficially resembling human cars but capable of flying using the same unknown principles as the Visitors themselves, and apparently incorporating some element of intelligence, or at least instinct, since they do not crash into things as they move. The humans assume that the Visitors have created these vehicles as a gift in return for the plant matter which the Visitors are consuming, and the novel touches on the disruption such well-meaning gifts might incur on the Earth's economic systems. Toward the end of the book the Visitors also start producing housing units for humans, and it is even implied that something living may be inside them&nbsp;— perhaps even a Visitor-produced version of humans themselves.",
    " The Republic is decaying, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was elected to save the galaxy from collapsing under the forces of discontent. On the tiny but strategic planet of Ansion, a powerful faction is on the verge of joining the growing Separatist movement. The urban dwellers wish to expand into the prairies outside their cities - the ancestral territory of the fierce, independent Ansion nomads. If their demands are not met, they will secede - an act that could jump-start a chain reaction of withdrawal and rebellion by other worlds of the Republic. At the Chancellor's request, the Jedi Council sends Kenobi and fellow Jedi Luminara Unduli to resolve the conflict and negotiate with the elusive nomads. Undaunted, Kenobi and Unduli, along with their Padawans Skywalker and Barriss Offee, set out across the wilderness. Many perils lie waiting to trap them. The Jedi will have to fulfill near-impossible tasks, befriend wary strangers, and influence two great armies to complete their quest, stalked all the while by an enemy sworn to see the negotiations collapse and the mission fail.",
    " The Land of Little Rain is a collection of short stories and essays detailing the landscape and inhabitants of the American Southwest. A message of environmental conservation and a philosophy of cultural and sociopolitical regionalism loosely links the stories together. ;\"The Land of Little Rain\" The opening essay describes the \"Country of Lost Borders,\" an area of land between Death Valley and the High Sierras. The image created of the land at the beginning of the story is one of almost unbearable heat and dryness, punctuated by violent storms. Despite the description of how inhospitable the landscape is, at the end Austin proposes that the costs the land imposes upon a man are worth it because it provides man with peace of mind and body that cannot be achieved any other way. ;\"Water Trails of the Ceriso\" The section's title refers to the trails made by wild animals moving towards sources of water. The essay provides descriptions of the many animals that travel along the trails, including coyotes, rabbits, and quails. Their ability to find water where there seems to be none is extolled by Austin, a skill which she believes no human is able to match. ;\"The Scavengers\" This essay describes the various animals that live in the desert that feed upon carrion&mdash;most notably, the buzzards and the carrion crows. This scavenging is portrayed as a natural part of the desert, with a multitude of the scavengers working together to find food. The end of the story criticizes the actions of man with regard to the desert. The unnatural trash he leaves cannot used by the scavengers in the story, and as such serves as a stark contrast to the desert's natural processes for recycling waste. ;\"The Pocket Hunter\" A pocket hunter is a type of miner who hunts for pockets of ore deposits. In the story, the pocket hunter described by Mary Austin lives off of the land with minimal interactions with the civilized world. This harmony with nature, Austin argues, is essential to the pocket hunter's simple happiness. Despite Austin's muted praise, the pocket hunter wants to strike it rich in order to move to Europe and mingle with the landed elite, a goal he accomplishes. However, by the end of the story, the pocket hunter returns to the desert since it is his \"destiny\". ;\"Shoshone Land\" \"Shoshone Land\" narrates the experiences of Winnenap', an American Indian medicine man originally from Shoshone Land who was captured by the Paiute tribe. The story initially revolves around Winnenap', but quickly changes to a detailed description of the environment and wildlife of Shoshone Land to form an intimate tie between Winnenap' and the land he formerly inhabited. ;\"Jimville&mdash;a Bret Harte Town\" In the beginning of the section, Jimville is touted as a better source of inspiration for Bret Harte than he found during his own travels. Jimville's inhabitants are likened to the fictional characters that were present in some of Harte's short stories. Austin portrays Jimville as a small town set in a harsh environment and inhabited by simple yet endearing toughs. Although the inhabitants endure many hardships, Austin claims that there is an almost unexplainable pull which keeps them in town and encourages new travelers to stay. ;\"My Neighbor's Field\" The story is about a plot of land which changes hands many times&mdash;Austin characterizes this plot of land as an ideal field. She criticizes the owners of the field, the Indians and shepherds, because their habits and lifestyle scar the land. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that the field is destined to develop into an urban area. Austin claims that while the field may at that point serve a greater human use, it will not be better for the land and all life. ;\"The Mesa Trail\" This section describes one of the trails that runs through the American Southwest. It contains several passages detailing the damage human activity has done to the land. She criticizes the \"unsightly scars\" left by the Paiute Indians in the form of abandoned campoodies and the damaged plant life left by domesticated animals such as sheep. ;\"The Basket Maker\" This story follows the life of Seyavi, a Paiute Indian who loses her mate, lives alone with her child, and sells baskets she weaves in order to survive. Austin claims that the Paiutes make the land itself their home, with the natural ridges of mountains as walls and the wild almond bloom as their furnishings. It is because of this that Austin argues that the Paiutes will always be homesick when in homes built by man, as man cannot replicate nature's walls and furnishings. ;\"The Streets of the Mountains\" This essay consists of long description of mountains and their respective trails. The section characterizes the beauty of the mountains and their inhabitants. The story also contains critiques people who dwell in man-made houses. The comfort provided by such houses, Austin argues, results in people not being able to truly understand the beauty and divinity of the mountains. ;\"Water Borders\" The essay revolves around the streams and lakes that can be found in the mountains, generally formed from the melting snow higher in the mountains. The particular mountain in the story is Oppapago, a mountain within the Sierras in a forest reserve. Austin contrasts the mountain landscape to a meadow outside a forest reserve, which lacks color and beauty because it is damaged by the grazing of sheep. ;\"Other Water Borders\" \"Other Water Borders\" is centered more on the plants affected by the water from the mountains, both wild and cultivated. The story begins with a depiction of a squabble between several locals over an irrigation ditch filled by water from the mountains. This is followed by a series of descriptions of the variety of plants that the irrigation ditch allows to thrive. Found within these depictions of plant life is Austin's lament of the complexities of civilization. Austin implies that with the advent of cities and manufactured objects people have lost an innate ability to know what natural remedies may be beneficial or detrimental to one's health. ;\"Nurslings of the Sky\" The \"nurslings of the sky\" are storms, formed in the hills and given almost human characteristics by Austin. The beginning of the story contains an account of the destruction of a town by floods and snow. The blame for the events is not placed on nature, but rather the people whose poorly placed town was destroyed. The story continues with descriptions of storms and their effects upon the wildlife of the area, pausing to explain how the land teaches people things. The story uses the example of a group of Native Americans who learn the use of smoke signals by observing the dust pillars formed by desert winds at the edges of mesas. The end of the story expresses Austin's discontent at how people have dealt with the weather by determining the best seasons to plant crops rather than by musing about the \"eternal meanings of the skies\". ;\"The Little Town of the Grape Vines\" \"The Little Town of Grape Vines,\" or El Pueblo de Las Uvas, tells a story of a simple people living in peace with their environment. With houses made of mud, homemade wine, and gardens to provide the fruits, vegetables, and herbs, the townspeople live a simple life without the complex notions of wealth and class that Austin feels have corrupted much of society. Austin describes the lives of the people living in the town, lives which consist of little more than planting, harvesting, eating, making music, raising children, and dancing. The end of the story is a call back to the simple life exemplified in \"The Little Town of the Grape Vines,\" criticizing those people who are overly obsessed with their own perceived importance in a world where their actions truly matter little.",
    " The book shares the personal stories of several families fighting autism. These stories focus on alternative autism therapies that they try to heal their children, as well as McCarthy's own reminiscing about her autistic child and her outspoken and contentious activism. The book includes the daughter of the founder of Autism Speaks, who claims to have changed her son's diet and improved his autism despite conspiratorial resistance from the organization, which, the book claims, until recently, rejected research into biomedical treatments; a mother who is claimed \"healed\" her son of his autism while taking on breast cancer; a father whose son was officially undiagnosed after allegedly under-going treatment for a laundry list of debilitating autism symptoms and regressions; and a sixty-year-old woman who made attempts to fight to save her son (now thirty) in the 1980s, the book exclaims that she paved the way for the parents of today. The book also features a list of controversial autism resources and a directory of DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!) doctors who are sympathetic to the widely discredited theory that autism is caused by mercury in vaccines.",
    " Azriel is telling the story of his transformation into and subsequent existence as an immortal genii who is forced to obey the Master who calls him. Over centuries, Azriel becomes less obedient to the Masters and a warning is placed on the casket of his bones that he is not to be summoned lest his evil be loosed upon the undeserving world. After many centuries of rest, Azriel finds himself awake and in New York City, a dazed witness to the murder of a young woman, Esther Belkin. He becomes inexplicably obsessed with the desire to avenge her death and to find out who called him into the physical world in time to see Esther die but not in time to save her. This quest leads him to the girl's stepfather, Gregory Belkin, who would pay any price to fulfill his messianic dream via his immense worldwide religious organization, the Temple of the Mind of God. As his quest approaches its climax, he risks his supernatural powers to forestall an attempt to destroy the world thus redeeming what was denied him for so long: his own eternal human soul.",
    " The story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947. Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old. Thursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \"Outland\" to find out what people in the real world think of him. Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenburg cake, has some curious house guests: Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos. Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them. Despite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues. She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the aging English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \"The Windowmaker\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike. Thursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him. On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\"). Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday. Goliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO -- at their headquarters in the Isle of Man -- and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness. Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband. Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilize. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \"stick\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly. On top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final in order to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy). She succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.",
    " Up to this time Cornwell had been going back through the period of the Napoleonic Wars to find new incidents into which to place his hero. Rather than do this, he adopts a \"prequel\" approach and uses an earlier campaign period in the history of the British Army, that of colonial India. The novel opens with Richard Sharpe serving as a private with the British army, then invading Mysore and advancing on the Tippoo Sultan's capital city of Seringapatam. Sharpe is contemplating desertion with his paramour, widow Mary Bickerstaff. His sadistic company sergeant, Obadiah Hakeswill, deliberately provokes Sharpe into attacking him, and engineers the virtual death sentence of 2,000 lashes for the private. But Sharpe is rescued by Lieutenant William Lawford after 200 lashes are inflicted, in order to effect a rescue mission behind the Tippoo's lines. Lawford and Sharpe are ordered to pose as deserters to rescue Colonel Hector McCandless, chief of the British East India Company's intelligence service. Although Lawford is nominally in command, Sharpe quickly dominates the lieutenant by force of personality and, without authorization, brings Mary on the mission. Joining the Tippoo's army, they discover that the Tippoo has set a trap for the invading British by mining the weakest (and thus most inviting) portion of Seringapatam's walls. Before Sharpe and Lawford can discover a way to transmit a warning to the British, they are betrayed by Sergeant Hakeswill. Hakeswill has been captured in battle and the Tippoo orders him made a human sacrifice for victory, but Hakeswill secures the Sultan's mercy in exchange for revealing Sharpe's and Lawford's identity as spies. Sharpe and Lawford are imprisoned as the British army prepares to assault the booby-trapped wall of the city. Mary helps Sharpe to escape, and Sharpe blows up the mine before the main British army can enter the trap. As the Tippoo tries to flee the city, Sharpe finds him in a dark tunnel, kills him, and steals his rich jewels. Sharpe throws Hakeswill to the Tippoo's tigers, but the recently fed animals ignore Hakeswill, and Sharpe's enemy survives to plague him in later adventures.",

    " On Abarrach, Xar is attempting to learn the secret of necromancy, but he needs a corpse to test it on. He interrogates the lazar Kleitus about the location of any living Sartan, and Kleitus reveals that Haplo lied to Xar about all the Sartan dying at the hands of the dead; Balthazar and his group remain living. Kleitus drops a hint about the Seventh Gate, and reveals that it's where the Sundering took place and that Haplo's corpse would know its location. Xar dismisses this idea, as well as the lazar, and is quickly becoming obsessed with the Seventh Gate when receives word that two Sartan have been captured: Zifnab, for one, whose pleas on Haplo's behalf go unheeded; and, as quite a prize, Samah, ruler of the Council of Seven. Xar is initially excited since Samah is the very person who would know the Seventh Gate's location, and he interrogates Samah for it to no avail. Sang-drax&mdash; the one who actually captured Samah and Zifnab&mdash; is summoned by Xar to mentally torture Samah to death; even before he dies, Samah does not reveal anything useful. Xar succeeds in turning him into a far-more-complacent lazar, but too much of Samah's will remains, and he still won't talk. Even worse, when Xar turns his back to investigate Zifnab's disappearance, Jonathan walks in and teaches Samah how to let go; the leader of the Council of Seven is now well and truly dead. Xar is soon told by Sang-drax of Haplo's \"treachery\"; he has helped the mensch start the Kicksey-winsey and given control of Arianus over to the mensch, instead of reserving it for Xar himself. Party to this conversation is the loyal servant who informed Xar of the capture and has already been ordered to investigate the Arianus situation: Marit, the woman Haplo loved, the mother of his child. Xar marries her in traditional Patryn fashion of rune-joining, both to ensure her loyalty and because it gives them an unblockable way to communicate, and then orders her to kill Haplo. Haplo rests on Arianus and tries to heal his heart-rune, a job that truly needs two people (most rune-healing is accomplished by \"circling\" and allowing strength from one person to flow to the other.) Prince Rees'ahn and King Stephen's deputy, the wizard Trian, have come to Drevlin to talk with High Froman Limbeck Bolttightener in the hopes of hammering out some sort of true alliance between all three races of mensch (the mysteriarchs having folded into the human race after their leader Sinistrad's death.) Haplo gives the Kenkari book to Limbeck, and the three races together reactivate the Kicksey-winsey, which realigns the scattered islands of Arianus and starts a constant flow of water through the sky. Then Haplo enters his dragonship and prepares to leave for the last time. Hugh, under contract to kill Haplo, retraces his own steps. He goes from the Cathedral of the Albedo back to the Fortress of the Brotherhood, where Ciang gives him a cursed knife: ugly, badly made, capable of self-movement... and covered in Sartan runes. It is the only weapon the Brotherhood has that might even possibly be capable of killing Haplo. As payment for it, Ciang orders him to never return or further payment will be taken in his blood. Hugh, in the end, doesn't even use his new Cursed Blade&mdash; its main advantage, suppressing Haplo's warning runes and a good amount of his magic, allows Hugh to sneak up on him in his ship and capture him, but the tables turn and Hugh accidentally ends up with Haplo's knife in his gut... only to lurch back from the grave, Alfred's necromancy rune having evidently condemned him to eternal life. Haplo circles with Hugh to calm the human's distress at returning from the dead yet again, and the two begin to plan how to find Alfred when they are interrupted. Marit appears and fights both Haplo and Hugh. The first time they engage their Patryn rune-magic, however, the Cursed Blade reacts, transmuting itself into various threats, and the three break off their conflict periodically to quiet it down (they can't really make it stop;) they also struggle over the ship's steering-stone. Eventually Haplo takes the ship to Chelestra, hoping to douse the Cursed Blade in seawater, but the knife, instead of transforming into another weapon or creature, summons a dragon-snake that destroys the ship. As Haplo drifts in the sea, he hears a voice and looks up to see... Alfred. At Sang-drax's misleading suggestion, Xar has gone to Pryan with the pretext of taming the tytans, and he is frustrated with his inability to reach Marit. His real reason for being there is his hope of finding the Seventh Gate in the citadel that Haplo visited, but he finds little to encourage him. The five mensch&mdash; Paithan, Rega, Aleatha, Roland, and Drugar&mdash; aren't much help, nor is Zifnab, who has somehow gotten here after escaping from Abarrach. Shortly after Xar and Zifnab have arrived, Sang-drax says he knows now that Zifnab is \"one of them;\" after a battle with Zifnab's dragon, he takes on Xar's form and steals the ship, claiming that he will search for Haplo while Xar is on Pryan. It is revealed during Xar's stay that Zifnab is actually one of the dissenting Sartan who refused to go along with Samah's plan; he was among the mensch on Earth during the Sundering, and was the first of either race to escape the Labyrinth. It was he who penned many of the books Xar educated himself with. (With all that Zifnab has seen, his total dementia seems a bit more understandable.) Xar decides to leave Pryan in a ship he spotted outside the citadel, covered in Sartan runes, but to do that he needs to get past the tytans. He decides to need to kill off the mensch and revive them with necromancy to serve as distractions. The mensch are having their own problems. Paithan is obsessed with a room in the center of the citadel that he calls the Star Chamber, a room with seven huge seats and an apparatus that generates blinding light. Roland and Aleatha are mostly not on speaking terms; the elf maiden finds herself spending more time with Drugar, who may be the last of his race. But Drugar has discovered a delightful illusion: at a certain clearing in the garden maze, at certain times of the day, he can see ghostly shadows of people from all the mensch races, walking around and talking to each other. Aleatha is there when he uses his amulet to activate the platform, teleporting him instantly to a different citadel&mdash; where, as it turns out, there are other survivors. Marit finds herself in a Sartan prison. On a bench in the middle of the room, Haplo recovers from injuries caused by the Cursed Blade. Across from it, Hugh the Hand and the dog watch her with unblinking eyes. Their \"jailer\": none other than Alfred, who rescued them from Chelestra. After some discussion, Haplo realizes that they are in the Vortex, the one-way gate at the very center of the Labyrinth. It was here that the Patryns were initially imprisoned and chose to live for generations, until people calling themselves Nexus runners started trying to escape. (It's unknown when they abandoned the Vortex and all moved out into the Labyrinth.) Haplo decides to enter the Labyrinth in search of his daughter, whom Marit named Rue. Hugh agrees to go with him, as does Marit at Xar's command; he has told Marit to hold off on killing Haplo to report back any conversations Alfred and Haplo have about the other worlds. It is only Alfred who balks. He has nothing left&mdash; Orla \"saw\" Samah's death and chose a peaceful death to be with him&mdash; but fear of the unknown. The Labyrinth itself, however, refuses to let him return to the Vortex by unceremoniously dropping a mountain on top of the exit back into it. To Haplo, the Labyrinth seems afraid of Alfred, though he can't for the life of him figure out why; what is Alfred, besides a bumbling, useless Sartan? ...who can turn into a dragon and bring people back from the dead? The group is about to be overrun by tiger-men when, surprisingly, a Patryn raiding party comes to save them. This party comes from Abri, the one and only city inside the Labyrinth (anathema to the lone-wolf Patryns). While camping overnight, Alfred admits his true name to Haplo: Coren, a Sartan word that can mean \"to choose\" or perhaps \"chosen.\" Many Sartan children were named that, in hopes of a self-fulfilling prophecy, but (as Haplo points out) Alfred did not feel particularly amused when he awoke, the last living Sartan on Arianus. Clearly Alfred was Coren, was chosen&mdash;but for what? Marit, however, betrays them by revealing that Alfred is a Sartan. Haplo, Hugh, and Alfred are jailed by the city's leader, Headman Vasu, to await Lord Xar&mdash; Marit accused Haplo of being a traitor and plotting against their people&mdash; but are freed again just as quickly after Marit overhears the disguised Sang-drax plotting to kill them. Sang-drax and his cronies are also gathering a huge army of the Labyrinth's native monsters, with which to destroy the city of Abri and seal the Final Gate; they allowed Marit to overhear them to feed off the emotions that would come from it. Abri's occupants prepare for its defense, while Haplo and Marit, prodded by the dog, finally find their love for each other. Alfred feels out of place; though few seem to begrudge him his Sartan heritage, he is still out-of-place here, a clumsy pacifist in a city preparing for war. Talking with Headman Vasu, however, he eventually discovers that the city was not made by Patryns (who do not build cities,) or at least not by Patryns alone&mdash; the Sartan \"heretics\" who were expelled into the Labyrinth were accepted by the Patryns, eventually integrating completely into the society; Vasu himself is half-and-half, supplementing his Patryn tattoos with Sartan magic. The Patryns taught them the value of family; the Sartan, in return, taught the Patryns the value of banding together. Here, at the heart of the Labyrinth, rises Abri, the city that symbolizes the best in both cultures. Alfred also finds out why he is called the Serpent Mage: it is a title from a Sartan hierarchy of strength in magic, whose levels are named after animals. Serpent is very near the top. Alfred has found the meaning of his name: to choose his power, and all the responsibility it comes with... or to choose Alfred, who would rather faint than have to use his magic. Back on Pryan, Drugar returns from the other citadel with knowledge: he knows how to stop the tytans. Aleatha has fled the maze, though; pushed into hysterics by his sudden (and literal) disappearance, she ran back to her brother, and the four are now at a \"party\" of Xar's, at which he hopes to kill them with poisoned wine so that their bodies will be undamaged. Zifnab, however, saves them by drinking all of it himself and saying that it was poisoned, faking his death once again. The mensch are horrified at the revelation that Xar means to kill them. Aleatha escapes the room, while the other three are sealed inside by Xar... until Zifnab's dragon discovers Zifnab's \"death\" and tears the room apart. Aleatha has fled once again into the maze, where Xar can't pursue her because of protective Sartan runes covering its path. She runs into Drugar and he tells her they have to let the tytans inside to help them; he shares with her how to stop them. They run for the gates, but before they can reach it, Xar attacks; Drugar sacrifices himself to save Aleatha. Xar is about to kill Aleatha when the dragon strikes, distracting Xar with battling it instead of killing mensch. The other mensch have escaped from the destroyed room and find her, and they think she's mad when she tells them what she's going to do. She uses the amulet to open the gate and invites the tytans inside; they peacefully enter and ask, &mdash;Where is the citadel? to which Aleatha answers, \"Here is the Citadel. You are home.\" Xar recovers from his battle with the dragon, and prepares to leave for the Labyrinth after Marit reports back to him&mdash; apparently corrupted by Haplo's influence into thinking Xar has made a mistake in allying with the dragon-snakes, as she says they are planning an attack. He is surprised when the tytans don't kill the mensch, and actually act to protect the mensch from him, but he avoids a fight by snatching Drugar's amulet from Aleatha and running away with it. The amulet will gain him entry into the Sartan ship, which he can then use to return to the Labyrinth. At Abri, the battle between Patryns and Labyrinth creatures rages fiercely, but the real threat comes from the dragon-snakes. Haplo, Marit, and Hugh lead a sortie to deal with them, and the three battle Sang-drax in his serpent form. Sang-drax is apparently killed by Haplo, but Haplo has been badly injured and almost crushed beneath the massive body. Marit is attacked by a wolfen when a green and golden dragon carries it away: Alfred, having made his choice to accept his power. He lifts the serpent's body off of Haplo, leaving Marit to hold his blood-soaked form, his heart-rune's wound having reopened. But while Alfred is distracted in battle with the dragon-snakes, Xar appears. He wants Haplo's knowledge of the Chamber of the Damned, and will stop at nothing to get it. The battle ends with the Labyrinth's armies driven off, but Marit dazed and wounded, Haplo abducted by Xar, and Alfred missing in action.",
    " The Eight features two intertwined storylines set centuries apart. The first takes place in 1972 and follows American computer expert Catherine “Cat” Velis as she is sent to Algeria for a special assignment. The second is set in 1790 and revolves around Mireille, a novice nun at Montglane Abbey. The fates of both characters are intertwined as they try to unravel the mystery behind the Montglane Service, a chess set that holds the key to a game of unlimited power. A gift from the Moors to Emperor Charlemagne, these pieces have been hunted fervently throughout the years by those seeking ultimate control. In the throes of the French Revolution, Mireille and her cousin Valentine must help in dispersing the pieces of the chess set to keep them out of the wrong hands. However, when Valentine is brutally murdered in Reign of Terror, Mireille is thrown into the midst of men and women who would pursue power at any cost, including Napoleon, Robespierre, Talleyrand, Catherine the Great, and more. She comes to realize she must rely on her own intuition and tenacity to accomplish her goal. In 1972, Cat Velis faces a similar atmosphere of conspiracy, assassination and betrayal. When she is requested by an antique dealer to recover the chess pieces, she unwittingly enters into a mysterious game that will endanger her life. As she learns the story of the Montglane Service, she begins to realize that players of the Game may plan their moves, but their very existence makes them pawns as well.",

    " In his \"Preliminary Discourse\", Barruel defines the three forms of conspiracy as the \"conspiracy of impiety\" against God and Christianity, the \"conspiracy of rebellion\" against kings and monarchs, and \"the conspiracy of anarchy\" against society in general. He sees the end of the 18th century as \"one continuous chain of cunning, art, and seduction\" intended to bring about the \"overthrow of the altar, the ruin of the throne, and the dissolution of all civil society\". The first volume examines the anti-Christian conspiracy that was begun by Voltaire in 1728 when Barruel claimed that Voltaire \"consecrated his life to the annihilation of Christianity\". Barruel returned to the principal texts of the Enlightenment and found reasons to draw close links between the philosophism of the time and the anti-Christian campaigns of the Revolution. Here he found that the philosophes had created an age of pretend philosophy which they used in their battle with Christianity. Their commitment to liberty and equality were really commitments of \"pride and revolt\". Barruel claimed that the proponents of the Enlightenment led people into illusion and error and refers to the philosophes as \"Writers of this species, so far from enlightening the people, only contribute to lead them into the path of error\". He alleged that Voltaire, dAlembert, and Frederick II, the King of Prussia, planned the course of events that lead to the French Revolution. They began with an attack on the Church where a \"subterranean warfare of illusion, error, and darkness waged by the Sect\" attempted to destroy Christianity. The influence of the philosophes could not be underrated according to Barruel. They created the intellectual framework that put the conspiracy in motion and controlled the ideology of the secret societies. Barruel appears to have read the work of the philosophes and his direct and extensive quotes shows a deep knowledge of their beliefs. This is unusual among the enemies of the Enlightenment, who rarely distracted themselves by reading the works and authors they were attacking. Barruel believed the philosophes were important as the original villains that seduced the population and made Enlightenment, and subsequently revolutionary, ideals favorable. The second volume focuses on the anti-monarchical conspiracy that was led by Jean Jacques Rousseau and Baron de Montesquieu. These conspirators sought to destroy the established monarchies under the guise of \"Independence and Liberty\". Barruel analyses and criticizes Montesquieus The Spirit of Laws and Rousseaus Social Contract because the application of the ideas expressed in these books had \"given birth to that disquieted spirit which fought to investigate the rights of sovereignty, the extent of their authority, the pretended rights of the free man, and without which every subject is branded for a slave - and every king a despot\". He believed that the influence of these two writers was a necessary factor in the enactment of the French Revolution. He agreed with the revolutionaries as they themselves placed the remains of Voltaire and Rousseau in the Pantheon to pay homage to the \"fathers of the revolution\". Barruel believed that the philosophes had created a lasting influence as their spirit survived through their writings and continued to promote anti-monarchical feelings within the Jacobins and the revolutionaries. The destruction of monarchies in Europe led to the triumph of the Jacobins as they trampled \"underfoot the altars and the thrones in the name of that equality and that liberty which summon the peoples to the disasters of revolution and the horrors of anarchy\". Barruel equated the rejection on monarchy with a rejection of any type of order and government. As a result, the principles of equality and liberty and their attacks against the monarchy were attacks against all governments and civil society. He presented a choice to his readers between monarchy and the \"reign of anarchy and absolute independence\". Barruels third volume addresses the antisocial conspiracy that was the objective of the Freemasons and the Order of the Illuminati. The philosophes and their attacks against the church and the throne paved the way for the conspiracy that was led by these secret societies. These groups were believed to have constituted a single sect that numbered over 300,000 members who were \"all zealous for the Revolution, and all ready to rise at the first signal and to impart the shock to all others classes of the people\". Barruel surveyed the history of Masonry and maintained that its higher mysteries had always been of an atheist and republican cast. He believed the Freemasons kept their words and aims secret for many years but on August 12, 1792, two days after the fall of the French monarchy, they ran though the streets openly announcing their secrets. The secret words were \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity\" and the secret aim was the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the republic. Barruel claimed he heard them speak these words in France but that in other countries the Masons still kept their secrets. A division of the group into numerous lodges ensured that if the secrets of one lodge were discovered, the rest would remain hidden. He believed that it was his job to warn all governments and people of the goals of the Freemasons. Barruel described in detail how this system worked in the case of the Illuminati. Even after Johann Adam Weishaupt, the leader of the sect, was discovered and tried in court, the proceedings could not uncover the universal influence of the Illuminati and no steps were taken against the group. The majority of the secret societies could always survive and carry on their activities because of the organization of the group. The Illuminati, as a whole, functioned to radicalize the movement against the throne and altar and influenced more members of the population to subscribe to their hidden principles. They refined the secret structure that had been provided by the Masons basic framework. For Barruel, the final designs of the coalition of the philosophes, the Freemasons and the Illuminati were achieved by the Jacobins. These clubs were formed by \"the adepts of impiety, the adepts of rebellion, and the adepts of anarchy\" working together to implement their radical agenda. Their guiding philosophy and actions were the culmination of the conspiracy as they directly wanted to end the monarchy and the church. Barruel believed that the only difference between the Jacobins and their precursors was that the Jacobins actually brought down the church and the throne and were able to institute their basic beliefs and goals while their precursors only desired to do these things without much success. According to Barruel, the first major assault on the Enlightenment came during the French Revolution. In the minds of many, the Enlightenment was inextricably connected to the Revolution that followed. This presumed link resulted in an explosion of literature that was hostile to the Enlightenment. When the leaders of the Revolution canonized Voltaire and Rousseau and made the Enlightenment themes of reason, progress, anti-clericalism and emancipation central to their own revolutionary vocabulary, it created a link that meant any backlash against the Revolution would increase opposition to the Enlightenment. The advent of what Graeme Garrard has called the \"continuity thesis\" between the Enlightenment and the Revolution – the belief that they were connected in some intrinsic way, as cause and effect- proved damaging to the Enlightenment. For Barruel, the Revolution was not a spontaneous popular uprising expressing a long-suppressed general will. It was instead the consequence of a united minority group who used force, subterfuge and terror to impose their will on an innocent and unsuspecting population. Barruel believed that the Revolution was caused by Voltaire, Rousseau and the other philosophes who conspired with secret societies to destroy Catholicism and the monarchy in France. He argued that the writings of the philosophes had a great influence on those who would lead the Revolution and that Voltaire and his followers were responsible for the training of revolutionaries. It was from the followers of the philosophes \"that the revolutionary ministers Necker and Turgot started up; from this class arose those grand revolutionary agents, the Mirabeaux, Sieyes, Laclos, Condorcets; these revolutionary trumps, the Brissots, Champforts, Garats, Cheniers; those revolutionary butchers, the Carras, Frerons, Marats\". Within the Memoirs, Barruel alleged that Diderots Encyclopédie was a Masonic project. He believed that the written works of the philosophes penetrated all aspects of society and that this massive collection was of particular significance. The Encyclopédie was only the first step in philosophizing mankind and was necessary to spread the impious and anti-monarchical writings. This created a mass movement against the church and society. Barruel believed that the conspirators attempt to \"imbue the minds of the people with the spirit of insurrection and revolt\" and to promote radicalism within all members of society. This was believed to be the main reason behind the Encyclopédie as it was \"a vast emporium of all the sophisms, errors, or calumnies which had ever been invented against religion\". It contained \"the most profligate and impious productions of Voltaire, Diderot, Boulanger, La Mettrie, and of other Deists or Atheists of the age, and this under the specious pretence of enlightening ignorance\". Barruel believed the volumes of the Encyclopédie were valuable in controlling the minds of intellectuals and in creating a public opinion against Christianity and monarchy. Philosophism was a term used by Barruel within the Memoirs to refer to the pretend philosophy that the philosophes practiced. It was originally coined by Catholic opponents of the philosophes but was popularized by Barruel. It referred to the principles that were shared by philosophes, Freemasons, and Illuminati. Barruel defined philosophism as \"the error of every man who, judging of all things by the standard of his own reason, rejects in religious matters every authority that is not derived from the light of nature. It is the error of every man who denies the possibility of any mystery beyond the limits of reason if everyone who, discarding revelation in defence of the pretended rights of reason, Equality, and Liberty, seeks to subvert the whole fabric of the Christian religion\". The term had a lasting influence as by the end of the 18th century it had become a popular term of abuse used by conservative journals to refer to supporters of the Revolution. These journals accused those who practiced philosophism as having no principles or respect for authority. They were skeptics who failed to believe in the monarchy and the church and thus, had no principles. The use of the term became pervasive in the Anti-Jacobin Review and contributed to the belief in a connection between the Enlightenment and the Revolution and its supporters. Philosophism became a powerful tool of anti-revolutionary and anti-Jacobin rhetoric. Barruel identified a number of individuals who he believed played direct roles in the Enlightenment and the conspiracy against Christianity and the state. He identified Voltaire as the \"chief\", d’Alembert as the \"most subtle agent\", Frederick II as the \"protector and adviser\", and Diderot as its \"forlorn hope\". Voltaire was at the head of the conspiracy because he spent his time with the highest levels of European society. His attention and efforts were directed at kings and high ranking ministers. DAlembert worked behind the scenes and inside the more common areas of French society. He employed his skill in the cafes and academies and attempted to bring more followers to the conspiracy. Barruel takes a close look at the correspondence between Voltaire and dAlembert and uses this as evidence of their plot to overthrow society. He is deeply concerned with the fact that those he identifies as the leaders of the plot had secret names for one another in their private correspondence. Voltaire was \"Raton\", dAlembert was \"Protagoras\", Frederick was \"Luc\", and Diderot was known as \"Plato\". Barruel also argued that the conspiracy extended far beyond this small group of philosophes. He believed that the court of Louis XV was a \"Voltairean ministry\" of powerful men. This group involved Marquis dArgenson who \"formed the plan for the destruction of all religious orders in France\", the Duc de Choiseul who was \"the most impious and most despotic of ministers\", the \"friend and confidant of dAlembert\", Archbishop de Briennes, and Malesherbes, \"protector of the conspiracy\". According to Barruel, this group of influential leaders worked together with a number of adepts who supported the conspiracy. The most important adept that Barruel identifies is Condorcet. Barruel claimed that Condorcet was a Freemason and leading member of the Society of 1789 who was elected to the Legislative Assembly and was \"the most resolute atheist\". Condorcet was important because he embodied everything that Barruel claimed the conspiracy was. He was a Freemason that associated with the philospohes and who would become an influential member of the revolution process. Barruel also lists the Baron dHolbach, Buffon, La Mettrie, Raynal, Abbé Yvon, Abbé de Prades, Abbé Morrelet, La Harpe, Marmontel, Bergier and Duclos among the members of the \"synagogue of impiety\".",

    " In South Africa under apartheid, Mehring is a rich white businessman who is not satisfied with his life. His ex-wife has gone to America, his liberal son (who is probably gay) criticizes his conservative/capitalist ways and his lovers and colleagues do not seem actually interested in him. Out of a whim he buys a farm outside the city, afterwards trying to explain this purchase to himself as the search for a higher meaning in life. But it is clear that he knows next to nothing to farming, and that black workers run it - Mehring is simply an outsider, an intruder on the daily life of \"his\" farm. One day the black foreman, Jacobus, finds an unidentified dead body on the farm. Since the dead man is black, the police find no urgency to look into the case and simply bury the body on the spot where it was found. The idea of an unknown black man buried on his land begins to \"haunt\" Mehring. This has been interpreted as the influence of apartheid on the class of privileged white people who profit from it while ignoring its victims. A flood brings the body back to the surface; although the farm workers do not know the stranger, they now give him a proper burial as if he were a family member. There are hints that Mehring's own burial will be less emotional than this burial of a stranger. This can be interpreted to symbolize the white man's position in South Africa: although he \"owns\" the land on a piece of paper, the black natives have the actual claim on the land. it:Il conservatore",

When the company arrive in Brighton for a one-week run at the Theatre Royal, Flood is confident that he will be able to use his stay to get in touch with his estranged wife Jenny, who has filed for divorce and is now living with Roger Colborn, a local businessman, on the outskirts of the city. Flood is surprised to find that it is Jenny who contacts him first: She tells him she is being stalked and, as she believes that her husband is to blame for it, asks him to do something about it. This is how Flood meets Derek Oswin, the alleged stalker, an eccentric man his own age who, just like his deceased father and grandfather before him, worked for the Colborns' family business until its liquidation in 1989. It turns out Oswin has written a history of the company but so far has not found a publisher. Talking to Oswin and to other people he meets, either by chance or by design, Flood more and more gets the impression that Roger Colborn is a dangerous man who has something to hide, and that Jenny must be saved from the clutches of the Colborn family before it is too late. Thus, Flood's interest in the affairs of a now defunct company is fuelled by his desire to win back Jenny, so much so that his professional life is affected. Trying to dig up dirt on the Colborns, he is drawn into a quagmire of events he cannot make head or tail of and eventually misses an evening's performance without giving any notice. When, however, on the following day he finds his understudy&mdash;the man who saved his neck the previous night&mdash;dead in the streets of Brighton he realizes the seriousness of the situation. In the course of one week homes are broken into, evidence is stolen, several people die, family secrets are uncovered, and an inheritance is reclaimed. Justice triumphs in the end.",
    " Shortly before noon on Saturday October 21 of an unspecified year after 2012 (evident by mention of a faded bumper sticker for Barack Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign), the small Maine town of Chester's Mill is abruptly and gruesomely separated from the outside world by an invisible, semipermeable barrier of unknown origin. The immediate appearance of the barrier causes a number of injuries and fatalities, and traps former Army Captain Dale \"Barbie\" Barbara—who is trying to leave Chester's Mill—inside the town. Police Chief Howard \"Duke\" Perkins is soon killed when his pacemaker explodes after getting too close to the barrier. This removes the last significant opposition to James \"Big Jim\" Rennie, used car salesman and the town's Second Selectman. Big Jim exerts significant influence within Chester's Mill, and seizes the opportunity to use the barrier as part of a power play to take over the town. Big Jim appoints one of his cronies, the incompetent Peter Randolph, as the new Police Chief. He also begins expanding the ranks of the Chester's Mill Police with questionable candidates, including his son, Junior Rennie, and his friends. Junior has frequent migraines caused by an as-yet undiscovered brain tumor which has also begun affecting his mental state; unbeknownst to Big Jim, Junior was in the process of beating and strangling a girl to death when the barrier appeared, and has killed another girl by the time Rennie places him on the police force. Elsewhere in Chester's Mill, Julia Shumway, the editor of the local newspaper, is phoned by Colonel James O. Cox, who has her carry a message to Barbie to contact him. When he does, Cox requests that Barbie act as the government's liaison in an effort to bring down the Dome, as it has come to be known. Because of Barbie's talents as a former bomb factory hunter, Cox gives him the task of locating the source, which is believed to be inside the Dome. Cox is also able to foresee the small town political ramifications of such a situation. By virtue of a Presidential order, Barbie is reinstated in the US Military and promoted to full Colonel. Barbie is also presented with a decree granting him authority over the township. However, smalltown politics being what they are, this action is not well received by Big Jim and his misguided band of renegade police officers. As Big Jim covertly encourages and orchestrates unease and panic among the town to build up his grab for power, Barbie, Julia and a number of other townspeople attempt to stop things from spiraling out of control. After crossing Rennie's path on several occasions, Barbie is framed and arrested for 4 murders. He is accused of killing Reverend Lester Coggins, who laundered money for Rennie's large-scale methamphetamine operation, and Duke's widow Brenda Perkins, who were both murdered by Big Jim. While Barbie is in jail other residents track the source of the Dome to an abandoned farm, and the device is strongly indicated to be extraterrestrial in origin. The restrictions issued by Rennie become more severe and the police force grows more abusive, galvanizing the town and eventually leading some residents to break Barbie out of jail, killing Junior seconds before he can murder Barbie. The semi-organized resistance flees to the abandoned farm, where multiple people touch the strange object and experience visions. They not only conclude that the device was put in place by extraterrestrial \"leatherheads\" (so named for their appearance), but that specifically they are juveniles who have set up the Dome as a cruel form of entertainment, a sort of ant farm used to capture sentient beings and allow their captors to view everything that happens inside. On an organized \"Visitors Day\"—when people outside the Dome can meet at its edge with people within—Big Jim sends Randolph and a detachment of police to take back control of his former meth operation from Phil \"Chef\" Bushey, who is stopping Rennie from covering up the operation as well as hoarding the more than four-hundred tanks of propane stored there. Many are killed in the ensuing gunfight and Chef, who is mortally wounded, detonates a plastic explosive device he has placed in the meth production facility. The ensuing explosion, combined with the propane and meth-making chemicals, unleashes a toxic firestorm. More than a thousand of the town's residents are quickly incinerated on national television, leaving alive only the twenty-six survivors at the abandoned barn, an orphaned farm boy hiding in a potato cellar, and Big Jim and his informal aide-de-camp, Carter Thibodeau, in the town's fallout shelter. Big Jim and Thibodeau eventually turn on each other; Big Jim stabs and disembowels Thibodeau, only to die several hours later when hallucinations of the dead send him fleeing into the now-toxic environment outside. The survivors at the barn begin to slowly asphyxiate, despite efforts by the Army to force clean air through the walls of the Dome. Barbie and Julia go to the control device to beg their captors to release them. Julia is able to make contact with a single female leatherhead, no longer accompanied by her friends and thus not caught up in their peer pressure. After repeatedly expressing that they are real sentient beings with real \"little lives\", and by sharing a painful childhood incident with the adolescent alien, Julia convinces the leatherhead to have pity on them. The Dome raises up slowly and vanishes, allowing the toxic air to dissipate and finally freeing the town of Chester's Mill.",

It can be read simultaneously as an unusual, charming love story, a description of the political and social forces at work in 1920s Brazil, a somewhat satirical depiction of Latin American aspirations to \"modernity\", and a celebration of the local culture and pleasures of Bahia. The book was made into series for Brazilian television in 1960, in 1976 and again in 2012. A feature film of the novel was directed by Bruno Barreto in 1983. The feature version starred Sonia Braga as Gabriela and Marcello Mastroianni as Nacib, and featured original music by Antonio Carlos Jobim.",
    " As a restless high school athlete in a small, unnamed town in North Carolina, Jason Maddox, the book's narrator, has a sexual encounter with his popular girlfriend’s alcoholic mother. Rumors of the encounter circulate at school, and Jason’s girlfriend, distraught when she learns of them, attempts suicide. Jason, himself previously popular, is shunned by his classmates, including the one who started the rumors. Jason confronts and savagely beats that classmate, and in the aftermath, he's arrested, expelled from school, and all but disowned by his conservative, mortified parents. Taking a job as a house painter, Jason moves into an apartment complex where he befriends his new neighbor, Bernard “Peewee” Mash, an intellectually precocious fifteen-year-old who, like Jason, is a local pariah. Peewee introduces Jason to art, literature, and, most importantly, punk rock. He and Jason are particularly enamored of the Los Angeles punk band Rule of Thumb, which is led by a Berkeley-educated poet, Jim Cassady, whom Jason and Peewee both revere. Learning that Rule of Thumb will be performing at New York City’s CBGB, Jason quits his job in order to drive himself and Peewee to New York. After the show, they speak to Jim Cassady, who advises them to start a band. They immediately make plans to move to Manhattan, where they live on the Lower East Side, center of the New York punk scene. There, Peewee becomes increasingly difficult, at odds with Jason musically and envious of Jason’s sexual prowess. Alternately given to tantrums and sullen silences, Peewee is ousted from the band that he co-founded. He and Jason pursue music separately until, recognizing how much they miss each other, they reconcile and start a new band. The new band has a growing reputation for its explosive, destructive shows, which result in injuries to person and property alike. Banned from most local venues, the band begins touring the U.S., and in the midst of what will prove to be its final tour, Peewee is killed in a car crash, with Jason narrowly surviving. Devastated by the loss of Peewee, Jason decides he’s finished with music, and, using money from an insurance settlement, he produces and directs a film that takes him to Los Angeles, where he falls in love with an aspiring actress who is herself seeking a new life after fleeing the civil wars in her native Yugoslavia. The actress, Irina, is married to a wealthy Englishman who is happily unaware of her affair with Jason and, possibly, others prior, though Irina denies any previous affairs to Jason. Their stormy romance is addictive to Jason, who begs Irina to leave her husband for him. She repeatedly, and emptily, assures him she will. At a party one night, Jason meets another former punk who tells him that Jim Cassady has recently been spotted, homeless and panhandling on the streets of Hollywood. This is the first sighting of Cassady, as far as Jason knows, since Rule of Thumb disbanded in the early 80s. Jason has always been mystified and intrigued by Cassady’s disappearance, and, on the Internet, he reads of other alleged Cassady sightings. Determined to find Cassady, Jason discovers that he’s now living in a bleak Los Angeles suburb with his elderly, controlling mother. He shares some of his recent songs and poems with Jason, who thinks they're deserving of a wide audience. Except for Cassady's music and the advice he gave Jason and Peewee at CBGB almost twenty years before, Jason might still be miserable in North Carolina, and he means to express his gratitude by helping Cassady gain a new following. But Cassady is resigned to obscurity, and he grudgingly submits to Jason’s efforts on his behalf. Perhaps out of spite, he causes a rupture in Jason’s relationship with Irina, and Jason promises to kill him for it, only to reaffirm, in the book's epilogue, how indebted he is to Cassady, who has again changed the course of his life.",
    " As volunteers clean up after a huge outdoor rock concert in Yorkshire in 1969, they discover the body of a young woman wrapped in a sleeping bag. She has been brutally murdered. The detective assigned to the case, Stanley Chadwick, is a hard-headed, strait-laced veteran of the Second World War. He could not have less in common with - or less regard for - young, disrespectful, long-haired hippies, smoking marijuana and listening to the pulsing sounds of rock and roll. But he has a murder to solve, and it looks as if the victim was somehow associated with the up-and-coming psychedelic pastoral band the Mad Hatters. In the present, Inspector Alan Banks is investigating the murder of a freelance music journalist who was working on a feature about the Mad Hatters for MOJO magazine. This is not the first time that the Mad Hatters, now aging rock superstars, have been brushed by tragedy. Banks finds he has to delve into the past to find out exactly what hornets' nest the journalist inadvertently stirred up.",
    " Leonora Eyre, an attractive and elegant, but essentially selfish, middle-aged woman, becomes friendly with antique dealer Humphrey Boyce and his nephew James. Both men are attracted to Leonora, but Leonora prefers the young, good-looking James to the more \"suitable\" Humphrey. While James is away on a buying trip, Leonora discovers to her annoyance that he has been seeing Phoebe, a girl of his own age. Leonora makes use of Humphrey to humiliate Phoebe, and turns out a sitting tenant in order that James can take up a flat in her own house. She does this in an apparent attempt to control his life. While abroad, the bisexual James has begun a relationship with an American, the amoral Ned, who later follows him to London. Ned prises James out of Leonora's grasp, only to reject him for another lover. James attempts a reconciliation with Leonora, but she refuses to give him a second opportunity to hurt her, and settles for the admiration of the less attractive Humphrey. As with all Pym's fiction, the novel contains many literary references, notably to works by Keats, John Milton and Henry James.",
    " The story takes place in Montefiore, Italy in the early 16th century, on the estate of a nobleman named Don Vicente de Nevada. He lives there with his seven year old daughter, Bianca, and a small staff, the two most interesting of which are Primavera, an earthy cook and Fra Ludovico. In the beginning of the novel, de Nevada finds a mirror in a pond near his manor. This mirror was fashioned by dwarves but lost when they left it in the pond to temper. Incidentally, one dwarf spends most of the novel following de Nevada to ask the return of the mirror. Life is good for the family until the day Lucrezia Borgia and her brother, Cesare, decadent children of a pope, come to visit. Cesare sends Vincente on a quest for a holy relic. While he is gone, Bianca becomes a young woman and Lucrezia becomes jealous of the girl's beauty and stealing Cesare's attention from Lucrezia. Eventually she hires a woodsman to kill Bianca. The girl escapes, and runs into seven dwarfs, who are looking for the eighth dwarf and their mirror.",
    " The book describes the construction of an important bridge in Albanian territory at an ungiven time or age. Told by a catholic monk, Gjon (Gjon is a name used by Northern Albanians who were mostly catholic prior to Turkish invasions), the story of the bridge, as seen by Gjon is filled with prissy, unhappy bureaucrats, who take the events at face value without ever trying to understand the larger forces at work. Both the river Ujana e Keqe and the bridge itself are major characters in the book, and they undergo significant transformations. One of the startling events of the book is when a \"volunteer\" is immured inside the bridge in order to make a \"sacrifice\" to the river. The man's face is captured in the plaster that surrounds him, as unforgettable as it is horrifying. Though clearly a punishment for the crime of sabotage against the bridge, as Gjon recounts this event, it is less an act of vengeance than it is a true sacrifice. But more than that, it becomes a symbol for the ignorance of and squabbling among tiny Albanian principalities and their fight amongst one another, in front of a major threat.",
    " The novel describes a world set in the year 2048 after a catastrophe which has fractured the United States into several nations. The protagonists live in San Francisco and have evolved in the direction of Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy, using wind power, local agriculture, and the like. San Francisco is presented as a mostly pagan city where the streets have been torn up for gardens and streams, no one starves or is homeless, and the city's defense council consists primarily of nine elderly women who \"listen and dream\". The novel describes \"a utopia where women are leading societies but are doing so with the consent of men.\" To the south, though, an overtly-theocratic Christian fundamentalist nation has evolved and plans to wage war against the San Franciscans. The novel explores the events before and during the ensuing struggle between the two nations, pitting utopia and dystopia against each other. The basic premise resembles that of Pat Murphy's earlier novel The City, Not Long After. The story is primarily told from the points of view of 98-year-old Maya, her nominal granddaughter Madrone, and her grandson Bird. Through these and other characters, the story explores many elements from ecofeminism and ecotopian fiction.",
    " Renn, a gifted but often bullied Eight Year novice in the Echorium who can speak to Half-Creatures, is asked to assist the Singers by translating for Shaiala Two-Hoof, a wild girl brought to the Island for treatment, who claims to have been raised by centaurs. Although initially the pair argue, meeting Rialle helps to calm Shaiala and she begins to remember, enough to reveal that her memories were wiped using a mask made of khiz. Second Singer Kherron takes this excuse to insist that Shaiala and Renn leave with him to search for Frazhin, the escaped khizpriest whose body was never found. After this revelation, Rialle takes Shaiala, who was very disturbed by her recolllections, and Renn to come to the cave where she lives and meet the merlee. While Shaiala swims with the merlee, Renn rejects their friendly offers and is horrified to learn that \"crazy\" Rialle is his mother. The next day, Renn and Shaiala leave with Kherron on the Wavesong, heading to Southport. On the journey, Renn is irritable and offends Shaiala by refusing to believe her tales of centaurs. Kherron also gives Shaiala a bluestone necklace. Upon arrival, the group begin to explore Southport and Shaiala, despite being closelyguarded by a pentad of orderlies including Frenn and Lazim, escapes, only to become lost in the rough part of the city. She is kidnapped and thrown in a cellar with several street children, and Erihan, the son of Lord Nahar, the leader of the Kalerei tribe of Horselords. The children are taken away by barge towards the Plains. While Kherron attempts to trace Shaiala through her bluestone necklace, they rapidly loose track of the barge. Meanwhile, the children meet \"Aunt Yashra\", a seemingly kindly pregnant woman who asks to hear each child sing, and then chooses some to return to her \"Singing Palace\" while others are to be \"gotten rid of\". This disturbs Shaiala, who recognises Yashra, and causes friction between the children, with many of those chosen wanting to stay. However, after three days of cramped conditions, they hatch a plan to escape. Shaiala kicks a hole in the side of the boat for the children to escape through, but several are left behind as the boat begins to sink, attracting the crew's attention. Shaiala and the other remaining children are taken to Aunt Yashra's camp, where Yashra uses the khiz mask to make them passive. Shaiala remembers the mask and, with Erihan's help, escapes. Shaiala and Erihan steal Yashra's horses and head onto the Plains together to search for tracks - Erihan for Horselord's, Shaiala for centaur's. Meanwhile, Renn is asked to track Shaiala's bluestone, as novices are more sensitive than Singers. Although they follow the barge for a few days, Renn is shocked when the bluestone is suddenly underwater, and he fears Shaiala has drowned. However, the bluestone is soon retrieved by a Half-Creature similar to a merlee, known as a naga. The Singers follow the naga upriver, and eventually arrange a meeting. The naga shows them its collection of 'sparklies' - consisting of Shaiala's bluestone, a piece of khiz and Erihan's dagger. Seeing Erihan's dagger, the Singers are attacked by Lord Nahar and the Kaleri, who have been following the Singers in their search for Erihan. After a brief confrontation, the two groups agree to work together, and the Horselords tell the Singers about the Sunless Valley, reachable only though the Pass of Silence, where they suspect the children have been taken. Renn contacts the naga again and, in exchange for the return of a 'sparkly', it tells them where it found the dagger - with Shaiala's bluestone - and where it found the khiz, in the mountains. However, it leaves before Renn can ask if it knows another way into the Sunless Valley. Meanwhile, Shaiala and Erihan eventually track down Shaiala's herd of centaurs by the Dancing Canyons. Seeing them, Shaiala remembers why no-one else had spotted them - the adults use herdstones to bend light around the herd, rendering it invisible. Shaiala offers to take herdstones to the centaur foals enslaved in the Sunless Valley, and she and Erihan travel there through underwater caves, guided by naga, within which they see khiz crystal poisoning the naga eggs. Meanwhile, the Singers attempt to get through the Pass of Silence, a pass so precarious that the slightest noise can start an avalanche. However, when they are attacked, Renn accidentally cries out, setting off an avalanche. Frenn and another orderly are killed, Kherron is captured, a crystal forced into his throat, and is taken away, and only Renn's quick thinking saves himself and the other orderlies from the second avalanche set off by the Harai guarding the Pass. Grateful, Lazim finally explains how Frazhin disappeared after the Battle of the Merlee twenty years ago, and, although those sent to find his body disappeared, he was not considered a threat after the khiz was destroyed. While the orderlies attempt to disable to gong used to set off avalanches in the Pass of Silence - thereby allowing Lord Nahar and the Kaleri to pass through safely - Renn hides, only to be caught by Yashra as she brings in the captured street children, and be taken to the Khizalace - Yashra's stronghold. However, there is trouble in the Valley - Shaiala and Erihan have arrived to find the captured centaurs working as slaves to mine khiz, and have freed them with herdstones, leading a revolution. The angry foals storm the palace, leaving Shaiala and Erihan no choice but to follow. They get inside the Khizalace, but are soon separated from the centaurs. Instead, they find a group of street children, apparently hypnotised, and follow them to their dormitory, which is dominated by the presence of a giant khiz crystal. Although the pair quickly disable the guards, they are unable to break the crystal's hold on the children, and only just keep from sucumbing themselves. Renn is taken to see Singer Kherron in the dungeons, who is clearly badly injured by the khiz crystal in his throat. Frazhin arrives, and attempts to force Kherron to teach the children in the Khizalace the Songs of Power, scorning the Singer's attempts to break free. Frazhin threatens that if Kherron does not help him, he will harm Renn - whom Frazhin believes to be Kherron's son. It is made clear in the conversation that Yashra's unborn child is Frazhin's. Renn is taken away, but escapes from his guards when he hears of a \"wild centaur girl\" causing havoc in the dormitories. He hurries to find Shaiala attempting to crack the khiz with her kicks, and helps her to crack the crystal and free the children. With the Khizalace shattering around them from the blow, the Harai flee, and Shaiala and Renn hurry to free Kherron, whose voice is badly damaged from the crystal, then join the battle outside. With the arrival of the Kaleri, the battle has turned in the Singer's favour, at least until Yashra appears and seals the gates against them with khiz power, trapping them inside. Although she seems victorious, capturing Erihan as a hostage and controlling the khiz against the Kaleri, she is distracted when Singer Kherron warns her to keep an eye on Frazhin, who is trying to escape without her. She hurries after him, and between Renn's singing and the centaur's kicks, the gates are destroyed. When the group catches up to Yashra, she is watching from the lakeshore as Frazhin on a boat in the centaur calls to the naga. Although they help him initially, they suddenly turn on him and pull him under the water. Yashra, trapped by the Singers, is offered a choice: immediate execution or life on the Echorium until her child is born followed by a course of Yehn. She chooses the Echorium, for the sake of her child, and protests before she is taken away that Frazhin's crimes are the Singer's fault, for destroying his hopes of joining them when he was a child. After leaving the valley, Shaiala and Renn forget their earlier disagreements, and with Renn's singing to assist her, Shaiala successfully cracks rock to find her own herdstone. A songless Kherron, after reporting to the Echorium with Renn's help, admits that, while he would be glad to call himself Renn's father, Rialle had a close relationship with Frenn - who Renn was named for - and Renn's parentage is uncertain. Shaiala joins the Kaleri to learn to be a tribeswoman from Erihan's mother, and Renn returns to the Echorium, where he reconciles with Rialle and the merlee.",
    " The Hunter, an alien lifeform (when not inside another being, resembling a four-pound green jellyfish) with the ability to live in symbiosis with and within another creature, is in hot pursuit of another of his kind. Both crash their ships into Earth, in the Pacific Ocean, and both survive the crashes. The Hunter makes its way to shore (its erstwhile host having been killed in the crash) and takes up residence in the nearest human being it can find (as it turns out, fifteen-year-old Robert Kinnaird) without letting the human being know. By the time it has figured out enough of what goes on inside a human being to look through Bob's eyes, it is shocked to find itself within an air vessel, being carried further away from its quarry every second. As it happens, Bob is simply returning to a New England boarding school from his home on an industrial island in the Western Pacific. Once Bob arrives at school, the Hunter sees no alternative to communicating with his host. After initial attempts produce panic in the boy, the Hunter eventually finds a way to convince Bob of his presence. Bob is very accepting of his guest, perhaps beyond what would be expected of a teenage boy who learns another entity is inside him, observing his every move. The two plot a way to return home. The puzzle distracts Bob from his studies, leading to a decline in grades that the school authorities ascribe to homesickness, and he is sent home for the remainder of the term. Upon arrival, the two begin to seek out their quarry. Bob is injured by an accident. The Hunter is able to hold the wound together, but he can't stop Bob from limping, and Bob is sent to the island doctor. They see no alternative to confiding in the doctor (the Hunter is forced to show his own form to convince the man) and the doctor becomes an ally in their search. Which of the many humans on the island is the host to their quarry? It is worse than a needle in a haystack (thus the title) because a needle at least looks like a needle, not a piece of straw. The Hunter is able to solve the riddle by observing the behavior of the island people. Bob's father, known for his attention to detail and safety, has been taking amazing risks. He is at least unconsciously aware that an accident will have no ill consequences. The quarry resides within him. The Hunter confirms this, and Bob and the alien have a new puzzle—how to get the alien out of Mr. Kinnaird's body without harming the man? This time, Bob comes up with the solution. He places himself in the middle of a large number of (empty) oil cans, uses a little actual oil to start a small fire, making it look like there will be a huge explosion shortly, and calls his father for help. The fugitive alien, fearful of being killed in the explosion, knocks out his host and removes himself from Mr. Kinnaird's unconscious body. As soon as the alien is a few feet away from Bob's father, the boy grabs the one full oil can, races over to the alien, pours oil over it, and lights it on fire. He then tends to his father. Mr. Kinnaird is fine, but Bob is worried. He and the Hunter had better come up with a good story for the man, or the Hunter will have to find some way to assuage the pain of a spanking.",

    " The story involves a widow named Minna Shaw. One evening, a witch falls from her broom when it loses the ability to fly and lands in the garden near Minna Shaw's house. Minna Shaw takes her in until she recovers, and when she does, the witch calls a friend to \"drive\" her home, leaving her own broom behind. Minna Shaw discovers the broom is still in her house and leaves it alone but is startled, and more than a little afraid, when it comes to life later that evening. She discovers that the broom is harmless, as all it does is sweep, but she teaches it how to feed the chickens, chop wood, and play the piano. While most of the neighbor women and children are comfortable with the broom, the men are concerned that it had been a witch's broom. Shortly afterwards, two boys begin to harass it. The broom, apparently angered, beats them and flings their dog over the forest. The boys' parents demand that the broom be burned at the stake. Minna Shaw surprisingly agrees, and the broom is burned. Things appear normal until the broom's phantom-white ghost begins stalking the Spiveys' house. The Spiveys are so terrified that they pack up and leave the house. Minna Shaw can now be alone and listen to the broom play the piano; she'd given the Spiveys her own ordinary household broom to burn and cooked up the plan for the magical broom (which was just painted white), to scare her neighbors away. She painted it white to make it look like the \"ghost\" broom.",
    " During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands Anne Frank began to keep a diary on June 14, 1942, two days after her 13th birthday, and twenty two days before going into hiding with her mother Edith Frank, father Otto Frank, sister Margot Frank and three other people, Hermann van Pels, Auguste van Pels, and Peter van Pels. The group went into hiding in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex of her father's office building in Amsterdam. The sealed-off upper-rooms also contained a hidden door behind which the Franks would hide during the parts when Nazi soldiers were investigating the buildings for harbored Jews. Mrs. van Pels' dentist, Fritz Pfeffer, joined them four months later. In the published version, names were changed: the van Pels are known as the Van Daans and Fritz Pfeffer is known as Mr. Dussel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and one month, until their betrayal in August 1944, which resulted in their deportation to Nazi concentration camps. Of the group of eight, only Otto Frank survived the war. Anne died in Bergen-Belsen from a typhus infection in early March, shortly (about two weeks) before liberation by British troops in April 1945.",
    " Jake spends a day having strange flashbacks of himself in a rainforest, which leaves him disturbed. That evening, after watching a boxing match with his brother and father, he leaves for a grocery store, where Tobias has discovered something has crashed and the high-ranking yeerks are trying to hide something. The other Animorphs join them, and together they infiltrate the store in fly morph. Cassie overhears Chapman saying that it was a Yeerk bug fighter. After Ax manages to reconfigure the ship's controls, the Animorphs escape, pursued by Chapman and the other Yeerks. They plan to fly the spacecraft to Washington, in order to convince the American government that Earth is under attack by extraterrestrials. When Ax discovers that the fighter's technology to keep human radar from seeing it is broken, they are intercepted by two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets, however, Cassie notices that they are over the Red Sea in the Middle East - far from their intended destination. Flying above the atmosphere, they are picked up by Visser Three's Blade ship sensors. The Animorphs, knowing they can't escape, try to fire on the Visser's vessel. Both Jake and the Blade ship fire their Dracon beams at the same time, and, coincidentally, their projectiles intersect, and both ships crash. The kids wake up in their wrecked Bug fighter. They look around, noticing that they've crash-landed in a rainforest. They assume they're in the Amazon rainforest, but are also disturbed by the fact that it is the middle of the day (whereas it was nighttime in the United States, which is in roughly the same time zone as South America). After Jake reveals the strange flashbacks he was having, Ax speculates they may have caused a \"Sario Rip\" and traveled twelve hours backwards through time, which would explain why Jake was having strange flashbacks: he was in two places at once, and the two Jakes---the \"past\" and \"future\" versions---experience each other's thoughts at random moments. However, Cassie later notices that only Jake has the flashes so Ax says that Jake is the only \"real\" person-the rest are just a memory. They soon find that the Yeerks have traveled backwards through time as well, and will need both ships to create another Sario Rip and return to the right time. Ax takes the Bug fighter's computer to prevent them from doing so, and the group ventures out into the hostile wilderness, constantly plagued by insects, fire ants, snakes and piranhas. They're pursued by the Yeerks, who ruthlessly destroy the animals and trees around them in a bid to kill the Animorphs, desperate to retrieve the precious computer. The children acquire jaguar and monkey morphs in order to traverse the rainforest more easily. They eventually stumble across a group of Amazon Indians, led by Polo, their tribal chief. Marco, who knows some Spanish, manages to roughly translate the natives' Portuguese, and Jake and Polo agree to assist one another in eliminating the Yeerks. Polo and his men kill the Hork-Bajir guarding the Blade ship with poison-tipped spears, leaving the Animorphs with Visser Three, who morphs an amphibian-like Lerdethak and picks the Animorphs off one by one. Jake morphs into a monkey to use the Ledethak's vine like arms to move himself to Visser Three's body. He then throws a poison-tipped spear into Visser Three: while never revealed, this may have been fatal. Regardless, Visser Three is still able to use an arm to break Jake's neck. However, Jake wakes up back at the grocery store, just as they are about to infiltrate it. He calls off the operation, and the Animorphs all go home. The next day Jake asks Ax what had happened. Ax postulates that the travel through time created two separate versions of Jake. The reason Jake simply \"woke up\" back at the grocery store was that the Jake in the rainforest died at the hands of Visser Three; since it is impossible for one consciousness to exist in two separate locations, when one was eliminated the two snapped back together. Ax also speculates that Jake had to die, or else both Jakes and both their universes would collide and cease to exist. The events in the rainforest never actually happened (including the acquisition of jaguar and monkey morphs), and only remain in Jake's memory. He is left with a feeling of chilling relief. *Sario Rips are introduced and explained.",

Figuring that it will reincarnate him if he changes it to plus and jumps in, he does so. It is left to the reader to decide whether Connor and Scrote were reincarnated or were fully annihilated.",
    " Count von Count and other Muppets are returning from a country drive in the Countmobile. But, in classic suspense/horror movie fashion, the bridge is out, so the group has to spend the night at a spooky old house. A giant monster butler escorts each character to a room, decorated entirely in one of the seven colors of the rainbow. No one is especially gruntled by their accommodations: Cookie Monster longs for a green cookie to go well with his green room, while the Count von Count does not like his red room (not one little bit of it), Ernie is not too thrilled with his purple room, Oscar the Grouch finds himself trapped in a bright pink room, filled with flowers and hearts, while Bert longs for a beige room over an orange one, Betty Lou is blinded by yellow, and even Grover finds himself depressed by his matching blue room. The group rapidly depart the next morning, happy to leave the weird house and return. The Sesame Street residents are unaware that the House of Seven Colors is in fact a tourist attraction, frequented by vast car and busloads of monsters who feel right at home in rooms that match their fur.",
    " The novel is narrated by Alexias, a noble Athenian youth, who becomes a noted beauty in the city and a champion runner. The novel suggests that young male Athenians were treated almost like modern debutantes and wooed by older men seeking to be their lovers; in fact, in a memorable passage, Alexias' father, Myron, himself a former beauty and champion athlete, writes to his son before leaving Athens for the Sicilian Expedition. The father imparts to the son the traits he should seek in a lover – qualities like honor, loyalty and courage. However, the father also warns the son not to become involved with women as he is much too young. (See Athenian pederasty.) The book implies that Myron had been Alcibiades' lover when the latter was a teenager, and felt that the way that Alcibiades turned out was at partly Myron's fault at least, as it was his responsibility as a lover to teach his eromenos virtue. As an Ephebe (adolescent male), Alexias falls in love with Lysis, a man in his 20s – a champion pankratiast and a student of Socrates. The novel follows their the relationship through the Peloponnesian War, the surrender of Athens, the establishment of the Thirty Tyrants rule over Athens, the democratic rebellion of Thrasybulus and shortly after. The story ends with first hints of the eventual trial of Socrates for teaching blasphemy and sowing social disorder. From the beginning of the novel, Socrates figures prominently; both Alexis and Lysis become his students in their youth. Also characterized in the novel are Plato and several figures from his Dialogues who were Socrates' students, including Xenophon. Another historical figure who figures in the story, albeit mostly off-stage, is Alcibiades, the Athenian general who flees Athens on a charge of sacrilege and functions as a military adviser to Sparta until he is recalled by a resurgent democracy in Athens. Alexis and Lysis serve under Alcibiades' command until his carelessness leads the fleet to disaster and he once again goes into exile. In the course of the novel, Lysis falls in love with and marries a woman who sees Alexias favorably and encourages the continuation of her husband's relationship with him. Not long after this, Athens is defeated by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Alexias' father is murdered under the Spartan-installed tyranny, and he and Lysis go into exile in Thebes joining Thrasybulus when he leads the next democratic revolt. Lysis is killed in the battle between the Long Walls running from the port of Piraeus to Athens (the Battle of Munychia). Shortly after the victory, Alexias takes Lysis' widow under his protection, marries her and continues his family line. The book ends with the postscript that this story (incomplete and long-forgotten) has been found by Alexias' grandson (also named Alexias), a commander of Athenian cavalry in the service of Alexander the Great.",

    " Jango begins with Seeker, Morning Star and Wildman who are all being taught in the Nom and are near the end of their training. Their teacher, Chance, mentions the secret skill of a Noble Warrior, and tells them a new teacher will be assigned to them to help them attain this secret skill. He then hands them over to Miriander, who puts them through training to learn how to control another's will by using lir. Once this training is over, it is discovered that Seeker has power without limits. Unlike the other Noble Warriors, he is able to suck the lir out of any living thing and doesn't get weary doing so. He fights and defeats Chance. Afterwards, he is told to stay in one place while the Elder and the council of the Nomana decide what to do with him, as they feel that they should not loose such power in the world, yet he might be the one the save the Nomana. In the trees of the forest called the Glimmen lives Echo Kittle who is described as being pale, slender and beautiful. She is captured by the Orlan leader, Amroth Jahan, who intends to arrange a marriage between her and one of his sons. She refuses to do so until the Jahan threatens to burn down the Glimmen and kill everyone in it. She decides to go along with them and soon they arrive in Radiance, which is led by Soren Similin. After a series of events taking up more than half the book, Similin manages to form an alliance between the Jahan and Radiance so they can destroy Anacrea with the use of charged water, which has huge explosive power. Neither the Jahan or Radiance intends to share the victory with the other. In his cell, Seeker is told by a Noma, Narrow Path, that the council of the Nom has decided to cleanse Seeker. Narrow Path believes this is the wrong decision and, knowing that he himself will be cleansed for this act, sets Seeker free, and tells him that he must go and fight the true threat; the Savanters, whom live in the land cloud. Seeker heads off to the land cloud, which is on the opposite side of the Glimmen, and on the way there he meets Jango sitting by a strange door in a broken down wall. At first, Jango seems to be a crazy old man, until he begins citing many of Seeker's personal thoughts. He gives Seeker much cryptic advice on how to defeat the Savanters and cites Noman's famous quote. (see Noman's experiment). Seeker continues on his way through the Glimmen but is stopped by Echo Kittle who has escaped from the Orlans in Radiance. She pleads with Seeker to help her defend the Glimmen from the Orlans but Seeker, knowing that he has little time left, refuses and carries on his way into the land cloud. There he kills five out of seven savanters but he is told to go back by a black figure, pretending to be his shadow. Seeker feels that something bad is happening at the Nom so he runs back as fast as he can. When Seeker arrives back at the Nom, the army of Orlans has already attacked and the charged water bomb ready to blow up the city, although Seeker doesn't know this. Seeker drives his power into the ground, causing an earthquake that stopped the battle in an instant, but the charged water bomb had already been launched at Anacrea and destroyed it, along with the Garden and the Lost Child. Seeker gets angry and takes revenge on the Jahan by breaking his pride, forcing him to kneel to Echo Kittle. The army of Orlans breaks up and Soren Similin dies from a charged water explosion. Seeker heads out in search of a purpose and runs across Jango, who is standing before a door. Jango says the door is open and he can enter if he wishes. Before he enters, he is told by Jango that there are many more Noms, and so he realizes the All and Only is not dead. The book is ended when Seeker enters the strange door next to Jango and enters an exact replica of the Nom's Garden that he was used to. He kneels down and asks for forgiveness for disbelieving in him after the destruction of the Nom.",
    " Mixing history and legend, it presents a situation in which pagan and Christianized Basques unite under the first king of Navarre and ally with Pelayo, the first king of Asturias to defend Catholic Iberia against the invading hordes of Islam. Amaya is a Christian noblewoman, daughter of a Basque woman and Ranimiro, the ruthless Visigoth general. She is a niece to pagan leader Amagoya, who prefers her other pagan niece as heiress to the secrets of Aitor, the Basque ancestral patriarch. Pacomio is a machinating Jew conspirating in disguise among Muslims, Visigoths and Basques. Eudes, duke of Cantabria, is Pacomio's son, but, by hiding his Jewish origin, has reached a high post in the Visigoth kingdom and aspires to power beyond what his allies and his father would allow. At the end, the secret of Aitor is revealed, to recommend Christianity, the pagan Basques (except for Amagoya) convert, and Amaya marries the Basque resistance leader, García, becoming the first monarchs of Navarre.

    " It is the story of a young Bengali man’s adventures in Africa in the years 1909-1910. Shankar, the protagonist, is a 20 year old man, recently graduated from college and about to take up a job in a jute mill, a prospect he absolutely loathes. He yearns for adventure, wild lands, forests and animals. He wants to follow the footsteps of famous explorers like Livingstone, Mungo Park, Marco Polo, all of whom he has read about and idolizes. By a stroke of luck, he secures a job as a clerk in Uganda Railways through a fellow villager already working there and goes to Africa without a second thought. There, he spends a few months laying rail tracks but soon encounters the first of many dangers of Pre-World War I Africa—man-eating lions. Later he takes up a job as station master in desolate station. Here he encounters the another hazard in Africa: the poisonous black mamba. He also rescues and looks after the middle-aged Portuguese explorer and gold prospector, Diego Alvarez. The encounter with Alavarez influences him deeply. Alavarez tells him of his earlier exploits and adventures, how he and his companion Jim Carter had braved deep jungles and mountains of Richtersveld to find the largest diamond mine. However, they were thwarted by the legendary Bunyip, a mythical monster which guards the mines which killed Carter. Shankar gives up his job and accompanies Alvarez as he decides to venture out once more and find the mines again. They meet with innumerable hardships, a raging volcano being the greatest challenge. Eventually they get lost in the forests where Alvarez is killed by a mysterious monster, the same that had taken Carter’s life, the Bunyip. Shankar sets out to reach civilization. He finds the Bunyip's cave and the diamond mines by accident. He enters the cave but eventually gets lost. With great difficulty, he gets out, marking his way with \"pebbles\" and taking some back with him as memento, not knowing each is a piece of uncut diamond. He finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave he found earlier really was the diamond mine. Gatti, as Shankar learns from a note by him, had uncut diamonds in his boots. The note said that whoever reads the note can take the diamonds as long as he buries his skeleton, with Christian rites. Shankar does so, and keeps the old diamonds. He becomes lost in the deserts of Kalahari and nearly dies of thirst. Fortunately he is rescued by a survey team, and taken to a hospital in Salisbury, Rhodesia, from where he sets sail for home. He ends the book saying that he will return to that cave one day with a large team, and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter and Gatti.",
    "Robert De Niro has completed a transatlantic box office double by topping the UK and US film charts with two different films at the same time.\nComedy sequel Meet the Fockers, in which he stars with Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, shot to the top of the UK chart at the weekend. It took £7.2m in three days - eight times more than the number two, Closer. Assault on Precinct 13 was in third. At the same time, US audiences were won over by his new thriller Hide and Seek. In Meet the Fockers, he picks up the role of an uptight father and ex-CIA agent from 2000 hit comedy, Meet the Parents.\nIt is a big leap to his role in Hide and Seek, a supernatural horror in which he plays a widower whose daughter's imaginary friend turns nasty. In the UK box office chart, Meet the Fockers pushed Closer off the top spot while police action movie Assault On Precinct 13, starring rapper Ja Rule, made £750,000 in its first weekend. London Underground thriller Creep was another new entry at six while quirky comedy Sideways, which got five Oscar nominations last week, entered in eighth place. The Oscar nominations do not seem to have had an impact on fans' choices at cinemas. Leading contenders The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Ray all suffered substantial drops in takings compared with the previous weekend.",
    "The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy (DOE) lab. DOE test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The current top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocks up 35.86. Due next week, the Top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second. The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles.\nThe US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the Linpack benchmark. Until the official list is published, however, Blue Gene/L's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries. But the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. Surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time.\nThe IBM Blue Gene/L is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the Livermore labs in 2005. Its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. The final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. The Earth Simulator has held on to the top spot since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. But in September, IBM said that another Blue Gene/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulator's performance. This was achieved during internal testing at IBM's production facility in Rochester, Minnesota, though, so was not an official record. Another giant to enter the fray is Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California. It would be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in October.\nSupercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. Their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis. IBM's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, Nick Donofrio, believes that by 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing. This means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second. \"When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world,\" Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website.\n\"You can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative.\" One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing - and Blue Gene machines in particular - as crucial is health. He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st Century: protein folding. \"Health is one of the most important problems, not just mapping the human genome, but also protein structures. \"We are a great believer in simulation. It gives you another tool,\" he said. Once the structures of proteins are understood fully, then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively. Compared with the current fastest supercomputers, Blue Gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact. Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.\nContrack International, of Arlington, Virginia, heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. Its withdrawal from the $325m (£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon's Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack's management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\nUS firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"",
    "The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.\nCommission officials are to look at Rome's provision of a 400m euro ($495m; £275m) loan to the carrier. Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. The investigation could take up to 18 months. However, Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot said he wanted it to be carried out as swiftly as possible. \"The Italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan,\" said Mr Barot. \"We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. I would like our analysis to be completed swiftly.\"\nThe matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia. While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. Alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. It plans to split into AZ Fly and AZ Services, which will handle air and ground services respectively. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. EU rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the \"one time, last time\" rule for airlines. Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. The airline declined to comment on the Commission decision.",
    "Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.\nThe Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be \"limited\". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and \"add-ons\" that the software giant offers.\nPeople who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.\nMicrosoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. \"It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,\" he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. \"China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,\" said Mr Cluley.",
    "The debut of US television hit Desperate Housewives has helped lift Channel 4's January audience share by 12% compared to last year.\nOther successes such as Celebrity Big Brother and The Simpsons have enabled the broadcaster to surpass BBC2 for the first month since last July. However the channel's share of the audience fell from 11.2% to 9.6% last month in comparison with January 2004. Celebrity Big Brother attracted less viewers than its 2002 series.\nComedy drama Desperate Housewives managed to pull in five million viewers at one point during its run to date, attracting a quarter of the television audience. The two main television channels, BBC1 and ITV1, have both seen their monthly audience share decline in a year on year comparison for January, while Five's proportion remained the same at a slender 6.3%. Digital multi-channel TV is continuing to be the strongest area of growth, with the BBC reporting Freeview box ownership of five million, including one million sales in the last portion of 2004. Its share of the audience soared by 20% in January 2005 compared with last year, and currently stands at an average of 28.6%.",
    "Video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004.\nGamers spent more than £1.34bn in 2004, almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the UK gaming industry's trade body. Sales records were smashed by the top title of the year GTA: San Andreas - in which players got the job of turning central character CJ into a crime boss. The game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale. This feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the UK. Although only released in November the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. There were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies. Five titles, including Sony EyeToy Play and EA's Need for Speed: Underground 2, managed this feat according to figures compiled by Chart-Track for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (Elspa). Electronic Arts, the world's biggest games publisher, had 9 games in the top 20.\n2004 was a \"stellar year\" said Roger Bennett, director general of Elspa. \"In a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,\" he said. Part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. Halo, The Sims, Driver, Need for Speed, Fifa football, Burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. Despite this fondness for older games, Doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. Movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. Games linked to Shrek, The Incredibles, Spider-Man, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings were all in the top 20. Elspa noted that sales of Xbox games rose 37.9% during the year. However, Sony's PlayStation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the £1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. Despite winning awards and rave reviews Half-Life 2 did not appear in the list. This was because it was only released on PC and, compared to console titles, sold in relatively small numbers. Also the novel distribution system adopted by developer Valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. Valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.",

    "French president Jacques Chirac has called the UK's £3bn rebate from the European Union \"unjustified\".\nSpeaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the EU would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. He said it remained justified because less EU farm money came to the UK.\nMr Chirac told reporters in Brussels: \"One can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the British cheque. It can no longer be justified. It was from the past.\" But a UK Government official responded: \"Even with the rebate, the UK pays two and a half times more than France contributes to the EU budget. Without it we would pay 14 times as much as France. \"There can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.\"\nThe 25-member EU is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013, with the bloc's Luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a June summit. Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a \"crucial test\" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain. EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.\nThe UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. Mr Straw has said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: \"I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe.\n\"The UK is already one of the biggest net contributors to the EU .\" The foreign secretary meanwhile said the \"justice\" of the rebate remained. \"We have one of the lowest net receipts of any EU country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. \"That continues to be the case.\"\nUK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was \"set in stone\" and there was no reason to negotiate about it. \"It is extraordinary to do it at this time, just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the EU. If we lose our rebate as well, the British taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that I think everyone will go off the European project.\" EU leaders are holding talks in Brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish European economy. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is meeting his EU counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the European Constitution. The plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. Critics - including Germany and France - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in Eastern Europe, undercutting large EU economies and undermining social protections. There are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern European countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in Germany.\nMr Straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate. \"European countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods,\" he said. \"What we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.\" Britain's low unemployment meant there was less \"neurosis\" about people coming from eastern European countries. \"In countries like Germany and France, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in,\" he said.",
    "China lent Russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.\nThe Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China's CNPC.\nAccording to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk's former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. \"The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,\" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. \"There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.\"\nThe announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.\nThe embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country's richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\nThe deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China's thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. \"Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],\" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. \"They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.\" \"If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,\" Mr Lukashov continued. \"And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it's a good deal for them too.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "(after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)\nJohn Arne Riise volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but Steven Gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. Blues boss Jose Mourinho was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. Drogba and Kezman scored from close range before Antonio Nunez's header made for a tense finale. It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager. Yet it was controversial too, after Mourinho's sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.\nRiise could not have connected any better with Morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past Petr Cech. The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampard's powerfully-struck drive and Drogba's low shot. Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpool's well-organised defence.\nJoe Cole had a shot blocked and a promising Damien Duff break was halted by a good tackle from Djimi Traore, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from Gudjohnsen's header, then to smother William Gallas' follow-up. And despite Chelsea's possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as Luis Garcia fed Dietmar Hamann whose shot forced a superb save from Cech. And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. That prompted Mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and Duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. Dudek saved bravely at the Irishman's feet, while Milan Baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. Drogba almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. But seconds after the half-time interval, Drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from Glen Johnson's long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. And Kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after Gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.\nDudek, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore (Biscan 67), Luis Garcia, Gerrard, Hamann, Riise, Kewell (Nunez 56), Morientes (Baros 74).\nSubs Not Used: Pellegrino, Carson.\nHyypia, Traore, Hamann, Carragher.\nRiise 1, Nunez 113.\nCech, Paulo Ferreira, Ricardo Carvalho, Terry, Gallas (Kezman 74), Jarosik (Gudjohnsen 45), Lampard, Makelele, Cole (Johnson 81), Drogba, Duff.\nSubs Not Used: Pidgeley, Tiago.\nLampard, Kezman, Drogba, Duff.\nGerrard 79 og, Drogba 107, Kezman 112.\n78,000\nS Bennett (Kent).",
    "The Conservative Party would deal \"sympathetically\" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.\nDr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for \"vindictiveness\" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.\nA jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.\nHe won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. Dr Fox was asked if he would say yes or no if Lord Archer applied to rejoin. \"I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. \"I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell.\"\nTory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. \"After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,\" he added. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. He said: \"I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. But there is no doubt it would be controversial.\" Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.",
    "Investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced.\nEighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\nFurther details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. \"This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,\" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA's 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another's share prices.\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned.\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to end its Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) on midnight of 31 December. Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\nIt added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.",

    "Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a \"super union\" of two million members.\nThe move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that \"nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda\" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday.

    "Tony Blair should set out a proper exit strategy from Iraq in the wake of next Sunday's elections in the country, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.\nIn a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of George W Bush, Mr Kennedy said Iraq had become a \"crucible of militant terrorism\". He wants to see a phased withdrawal of UK troops \"as soon as the situation allows\", he said in London. Any exit strategy must \"augment and support\" the democratic process.\n\"There are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of British and American troops in Iraq feeds the insurgency,\" he said. \"There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.\" Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal \"regardless of the situation on the ground\".\nHe accused Mr Blair's government of \"being less than straightforward\" over its plans. \"Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq,\" Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech. \"He should set out a proper exit strategy, including the phased withdrawal of British troops, as the security situation allows.\" Mr Kennedy also argued that British troops deployed in Iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - \"especially Islamic countries\".",
    "Amelie Mauresmo and Maria Sharapova won their opening matches at the Tour Championships in Los Angeles.\nFrance's Mauresmo routed Vera Zvonareva 6-1 6-0, while Wimbledon champion Sharapova was a 6-1 6-4 winner over fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. American Serena Williams also won, edging Russian Elena Dementieva 7-6 7-5 for her second victory of the event. The event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.\nMauresmo's win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the number one spot. Mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the US Open before injury ushered Davenport back in front. \"Since then, I feel very confident on court and my game is there. I want to get the ranking back, but it's very different than before I was number one. \"It was an obsession, but now I take it in a relaxed way.\" Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russia's Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.\n\"She got mad a little bit and I played some great tennis,\" said Mauresmo, who was runner-up to Kim Clijsters in last year's final. Zvonareva has lost both her games so far, having crashed 6-2 6-4 Kuznetsova in the Staples Centre on Wednesday. \"Sometimes not everything works,\" she said. \"It was lots of pressure. Maybe that is why I couldn't do 100%. But I was fighting.\" Sharapova, who lost 6-2 6-2 to Kuznetsova in Beijing in September, said: \"In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable. \"This time, it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.\" The tournament debutant added: \"I love it here. The atmosphere is great. \"To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball.\" Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. \"It's hard to go out there and get it right but I'm fighting and I'm hoping,\" said Williams. \"What makes me happy is the effort.

Money raised will go to the Fondation pour l'Enfance (Foundation for Childhood) which aims to rebuild a children's shelter in Sri Lanka. Sir Elton played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his wife Anne-Aymone.

    "A Labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the Royal Family the same rights as males.\nThe legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the Crown. It would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. But the government refused to back Lord Dubs' Succession to the Crown Bill, saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues.\nThe Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, agreed the 1701 Act of Settlement, which governs the succession, was discriminatory but added that \"for all practical purposes its effects are limited\".\nThe changes proposed by Lord Dubs were a \"complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues\", he said. Lord Falconer said there were 22 members of the Royal Family in the line of succession after the Prince of Wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act. \"It is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. While we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn't the proper form,\" he added.\nHe did not rule out change in the future but said if Lord Dubs' private member's bill was passed by peers, he would urge MPs to oppose it in the Commons. Lord Dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the House of Lords, but urged the government to think again at a later stage. \"We cannot forever say we don't want to change things because it is too difficult,\" he told peers. During the debate, the Labour peer and former minister said: \"The monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. \"What we don't want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times. \"We are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against Catholics.\" But opponents of the bill, including Tory Lord Campbell of Alloway and the Bishop of Winchester, the Rt Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, said it would separate the state from both the Church of England and the Christian faith. Such a \"secular\" state would be markedly \"less tolerant\", Rt Rev Scott-Joynt argued.",
    "The UK' opposition Conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the General Election. Here's a guide to the plan:\nPeople coming to live and work in Britain from outside the EU. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of TB, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the European Union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.\nTuberculosis, Hepatitis B and HIV. A positive test for TB would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.\nPeople would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the UK, or impose significant costs or demands on the NHS. They would also, if appropriate, have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.\nPeople coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching. Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB. Under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and HIV.\nThe Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health. However, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.\nThey claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. They also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into Britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. They say the plans will protect access to the NHS.\nApplicants will be tested in their home country. Only asylum seekers will be tested in the UK once their refugee status is established.\nHome Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries. Recent medical checks were carried out on 175,000 people at Heathrow Airport and 10,000 at Gatwick. From those tests, about 100 infectious cases of TB were found.\nThe Tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. The party has looked at the way the system is operated in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Tory proposals are \"quite closely modelled\" on the New Zealand system.\nLabour claims the policy is little more than a \"desperate attempt to catch up with Labour's five-year plan\" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week. This says health screening for TB will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. The Liberal Democrats have warned Labour and the Tories they were \"in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it\".",
    "Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.\nLG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. The firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in January 2004, which gave control to the creditors. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card's plastic for purchases.\nLG Card's creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.\n\"Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,\" said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm's major creditors. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. It says it wants \"fair and reasonable guidelines\" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said. Analysts believe a compromise is likely. \"LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,\" said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.\nLG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. LG card's creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. \"Eventually, LG Group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,\" said Mr Kim.",
    "Plans to portray Dominica's Carib Indians as cannibals in the sequel to hit film Pirates of the Caribbean have been criticised by the group's chief.\nCarib Chief Charles Williams said talks with Disney's producers revealed there was \"a strong element of cannibalism in the script which cannot be removed\". The Caribbean island's government said Disney planned to film in Dominica. The Caribs have long denied their ancestors practised cannibalism. Disney was unavailable for comment. \"Our ancestors stood up against early European conquerors and because they stood up...we were labelled savages and cannibals up to today,\" said Mr Williams.\n\"This cannot be perpetuated in movies.\" Shooting on the sequel is expected to begin in April, with hundreds of Dominicans applying to be extras in the movie.\nAbout 3,000 Caribs live on the island of Dominica, which has a population of 70,000. Many Caribs were killed by disease and war during colonisation up to the 1600s. Mr Williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film. But he admitted there were some members of the Carib council who did not support the campaign. He said some did not \"understand our history, they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the Carib people\".

She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. At first, White claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions.\n\"My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product,\" White said in the LA Times. \"Whether it be a good product or a bad product, he was selling a product.\" White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case. The 27-year-old believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning. \"I have no clue what it's going to take to change that,\" said White. \"I would say I made a mistake and I would never, ever go back. \"I would never recommend anyone to take that route.\"",
    "Tony Blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on Monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 May.\nThe date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted. Over the weeks, there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day Mr Blair would go for an historic third term. And the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. The prime minister and his campaign boss Alan Milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between Labour's stability and investment against Tory cuts and boom and bust.\nAnd Chancellor Gordon Brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in Westminster - to underline that economic message. And it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.\nDuring the phoney campaign, Labour got into trouble over its central claim that Michael Howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. The prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the Tories compared to Labour's plans was a cut. And it looked like the Labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by Mr Howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. Then deputy Conservative Chairman Howard Flight was reported to have suggested Mr Howard was secretly planning even bigger \"cuts\".\nHe was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering Labour campaign was back on track. A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again. Mr Brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. As usual, the Liberal Democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. But leader Charles Kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. Other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum, the war on Iraq, law and order and education, for example. But, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. And, whatever that outcome, 2005 is set to be a far more lively, even bitter campaign than 2001's non-event.",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "Celtic's Neil Lennon admits Rangers could be considered \"slight favourites\" for the Old Firm CIS Cup clash, but insists his side can still win.\nLennon concedes Rangers are in good form at the moment, but they have failed to beat Celtic in their last seven meetings. \"Rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks,\" he said. \"But it's a game we believe we're capable of winning if we play our best,\" he told the Evening Times. \"All the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in. \"Without playing at the top of our game, we have still been winning matches. \"At the minute, we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in Europe, so I don't think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out. \"Of course, it is a concern when you are losing goals, because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets, but hopefully we are over that wee run. \"Considering we lost Henrik Larsson at the end of last season, we have still been scoring a lot of goals, which is pleasing.\"",
    "US retail giant Federated Department Stores is to buy rival May Department Stores for $11bn (£5.7bn).\nThe deal will bring together famous stores like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Field's, creating the largest department store chain in the US. The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn. The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May's chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January. As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's - will assume $6bn of May's debt, bringing the deal's total value to $17bn. Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.\nMay has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as Federated and other retailers such as Wal-Mart. Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.\n\"We have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in America, creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence,\" said Terry Lundgren, Federated's chairman. Some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for May. \"Without this deal May would have been, to put it bluntly, washed up,\" said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group. Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while May's yearly sales are $14.4bn.",
    "Juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O'Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic.\nBrian Hassell says no official approach has been received from Manchester City but that the English club had been earmarked as a possible destination. But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O'Neill's first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would \"desperately like to stay at Celtic\" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted.\nThe agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old's father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho's father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. \"I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn't want to go there,\" said Hassel. \"He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic.\" Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. \"It was a thought at one stage,\" he said. \"If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. \"He is a fan of Kevin Keegan's style of play. It would not be a bad move for him.\" Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: \"The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn't happened. \"If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. That would be good for the club and good for me. \"If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes.\" The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O'Neill since his move to Celtic Park. \"I can't understand why I am in this situation,\" he continued. \"When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support.\"",
    "Oscar-winner Andrea Arnold has been congratulated by the UK Film Council, the organisation which partly funded her project.\nArnold's film Wasp won the best live action short film award on Sunday. \"The UK Film Council spends millions of pounds of lottery investment on short filmmaking in Britain every year,\" said chief executive officer John Woodward. \"It certainly pays off when you see new film-makers winning such prestigious awards,\" he added.\nWasp, which was commissioned by the Film Council and Channel 4, beat films by fellow UK nominees Gary McKendry and Ashvin Kumar to the prize. It stars actress Nathalie Press, who appeared in the Bafta-winning drama My Summer Of Love, as a single mother who is forced to take drastic action when she is invited on a date and is unable to find a babysitter to look after her four daughters. The film has already won over 30 other international awards including the Sundance Short Film Prize. Arnold, from Dartford in Kent, described her victory as \"truly overwhelming. I'm really not used to this kind of thing,\" she said, after receiving her Oscar from actor Jeremy Irons. \"Thanks to everyone who worked on this - the beers are on me when we get home.\" The director was one of only two British winners on the night, the other being Sandy Powell, who won the costume design Oscar for her work on The Aviator.",
    "The last film to be made by the slain Dutch director Theo van Gogh, called 06/05, has been premiered in The Hague.\nMembers of Van Gogh's family and celebrities attended the screening of 06/05, based on the murder of the anti-immigration politician Pim Fortuyn. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in Amsterdam six weeks ago. A Dutch-Moroccan man suspected of radical Islamist links has been charged. The killing, and Fortuyn's death in 2002, convulsed the Netherlands. Many Dutch people have questioned their country's self-image as a peaceful, tolerant nation in the wake of the murders, which triggered heated debate about immigration.\nAn animal rights activist was sentenced to 18 years in prison last year for killing Fortuyn. Earlier this year, Van Gogh made a film accusing Islam of promoting violence against women. It caused outrage among Muslims and death threats were made against him. The film 06/05 will become available on the internet on Wednesday and go on general release in Dutch cinemas in January. Van Gogh's movie mixes real images of the day of Fortuyn's murder with a fictional plot about Dutch intelligence services conspiring to silence the politician. The story unfolds through the eyes of a freelance photographer who unwittingly takes pictures revealing the involvement of Dutch authorities in Fortuyn's murder. Photographer Jim de Booy then goes on the run from secret service agents who burgle his home and threaten his family.",
    "The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.\nThe Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn. The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn. The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.\nDemocrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.",
    "The world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.\nThe Wolong Nature Reserve in the Sichuan Province of southwest China is home to 20% of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world. A broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. The data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. The reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.\nUsing the network, vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs' chances of survival.\n\"Digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside Wolong and with the rest of the world,\" said Zhang Hemin, director of the Wolong Nature Reserve. \"Our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings.\" The network has been developed by Intel, working closely with the staff at Wolong. It includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.\nBefore the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park, staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. Infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. To foster cultural links across the globe, a children's learning lab has been incorporated in the network, in collaboration with Globio (Federation for Global Biodiversity Education for Children), an international non-profit organisation. It will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in Portland, Oregon in the US. \"Digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world,\" said Globio founder Gerry Ellis.",
    "The shape of the UK's economy In graphics\nBut he denied that he was ruling out British membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year. Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future. Otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of China, he told MPs.\nThe chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.\nUnder Mr Brown's rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit. He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rules \"make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure\". But he argued that the EU was moving in the direction of the UK principles, and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year, to include investment, and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year. Under Mr Brown's \"sustainable investment\" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.\nMr Brown vigorously denied Conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. In March the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassified £3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only £6bn. Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter. But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was \"impugning the integrity\" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. Mr Brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap. He told the Treasury Select Committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost Treasury coffers.\nEarlier, ex-Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more \"rigid\" rules. But fellow Tory David Heathcoat-Amory said the folly of the system was in trying to run Europe's varied economies on one set of rules. \"The essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake,\" he said. \"The warning is about the European constitution, which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two, and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. It gives more powers to Brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy.\" But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. \"The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,\" Mr. Brown said.",
    "A call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and Asian MPs has been rejected by one of Labour's most senior Asians.\nShahid Malik, who is on Labour's ruling NEC, accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. Just 13 of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists. That came after it emerged that one of Britain's most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.\nMr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. \"If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,\" he said. He added: \"It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didn't have a minority candidate.\" Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.\nBut he argued: \"I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren't doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective.\" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as \"painful\". \"I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasn't worked,\" she said. \"The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people.\" On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was \"ambitious\" to improve black and Asian representation. \"We haven't ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this,\" he said.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "The stage adaptation of children's film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in London's West End.\nSir Cameron Mackintosh's lavish production, which has cost £9m to bring to the stage, was given a 10-minute standing ovation. Lead actress Laura Michelle Kelly soared over the heads of the audience holding the nanny's trademark umbrella. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins' flight into the auditorium during preview performances. A number of celebrities turned out for the musical's premiere, including actress Barbara Windsor, comic Graham Norton and Sir Richard Attenborough.\nThe show's director Richard Eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney's 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.",
    "A British author has had the film rights to her children's bestseller snapped up for a seven-figure sum, with Ridley Scott set to direct.\nMichelle Paver's Wolf Brother, a fantasy set 6,000 years ago, is the first in a planned series of six books. Film studio Fox has bought the rights for around $4m (£2.13m) for Scott's company Scott Free to develop. The director said he was \"thrilled\" with the project. \"Wolf Brother is an enchanting book,\" he said. Paver, who lives in London and previously worked as a lawyer, began writing the book in 1982 while studying biochemistry at Oxford University.\nShe was an established author of love stories when she turned the work-in-progress into a children's novel. It was published in 2004, with Paver earning an advance of $5m (£2.8m) - the highest sum ever paid for a debut children's book. Wolf Brother tells the story of Torak, a 12-year-old hunter who lives in the forest. After his father is killed he teams up with a wolf cub and sets out to rid the forest of an evil force. Paver is currently writing the second book in the series. \"Michelle Paver lives and breathes the worlds she writes about,\" said a spokesman for the author. \"I've told her about the film deal but at the moment she is writing the second book and her mind is 6000 years away deep in the primeval forest.\"",
    "The US dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on Friday as concern grows about the size of the US budget deficit.\nAnalysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. The Bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. However, trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. This has amplified reactions to news, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in January.\nThe dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on Friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on Thursday. One dollar bought 102.55 yen.\nDisappointing business figures from Chicago triggered the US currency's weakness on Thursday. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2, a bigger fall than expected. \"There are no dollar buyers now, especially after the Chicago data yesterday,\" said ABN Amro's Paul Mackel. At the same time, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was \"absolutely worrying\" for Italian exports. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. Investors will now look towards February's meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised nations in London for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar's decline.",
    "The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US.\nNew Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (£130,000) fine.\nIn a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 \"sound recordings\" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting \"criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks\". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April.",

Get Me Out of Here drew an average of 10.9m viewers - about four million fewer than the previous series.\nThe fourth series of the show peaked on Monday at 11.9m and 49.2% of the audience, just before Joe Pasquale won. This compared with a peak of 15.3m at and a record 62.2% of the TV audience when Kerry McFadden won in February. Comic Pasquale beat former Royal butler Paul Burrell who came second, nightclub owner Fran Cosgrave, who was third. Pasquale follows Kerry McFadden, Phil Tufnell and Tony Blackburn as winners of the show.\nSinger and TV presenter McFadden was the show's first female winner. When cricketer Phil Tufnell won in May 2003, 12.3 million people - 50% of the viewing public - tuned in to watch. And when Tony Blackburn won the first show in 2002, 10.9 million people saw the show. Pasquale had been the show's hottest ever favourite to win, and its hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, known as Ant and Dec, said Monday's deciding vote was the closest in the programme's history.\nPascuale has been flooded with offers of TV work, according to his management company, but one of his first jobs on his return is pantomime.\nBefore joining I'm a Celebrity, he had signed up to play Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk in Birmingham, and tickets for the show have become increasingly popular since he joined the TV show.

The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.",
    "An Iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries.\nArash Sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. Mr Sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area. His sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, comes a day after an online \"day of action\" to secure his release. Iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs, restricting access to major blogging sites from within Iran. A second Iranian blogger, Motjaba Saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests, is still being held.\nA spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi's sentence as \"harsh\" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. \"The authorities are trying to make an example of him,\" the organisation said in a statement.\n\"By handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger, their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media.\" In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the BBC Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda. Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. They accused Mr Sigarchi of a string of crimes against Iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of Iran's Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr Sigarchi's lawyer labelled the revolutionary court \"illegal and incompetent\" and called for a retrial in a public court.\nMr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world.\nThe Committee to Protect Bloggers designated 22 February 2005 as Free Mojtaba and Arash Day. Around 10,000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. About 12% of users were based in Iran, the campaign's director told the BBC News website. Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. \"The eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on Iran since Sigarchi's sentence, not less. \"The mullahs won't be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere.\"",
    "Newcastle manager Graeme Souness is closing in on signing Chelsea defender Celestine Babayaro when the transfer window reopens.\nSouness is bidding to bolster his defence and, according to reports, contract negotiations are at an advanced stage with the player. Babayaro has been in the Premiership since 1997 when he moved to Chelsea for £2.25m from Anderlecht. But the 26-year-old has been surplus to requirements this season. Souness would not be drawn on specifics over individual players.\nBut he said: \"All I can tell you is that the chairman has worked really hard in the last couple of months to try to do deals. \"We have said from day one we want to strengthen, and that is what we are hoping to do in the coming weeks.\"",
    "In a sign of a thaw in relations between Egypt and Israel, the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the US, allowing Egyptian goods made in partnership with Israeli firms free access to American markets.\nThe protocol, signed in Cairo, will establish what are called \"qualified industrial zones\" in Egypt. Products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the US, provided that 35% of their components are the product of Israeli-Egyptian cooperation. The US describes this as the most important economic agreement between Egypt and Israel in two decades.\nThe protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years. There has been deep sensitivity in Egypt about any form of co-operation with Israel as long as its peace process with the Palestinians remains blocked. But in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. Both exchanged prisoners earlier this month, with Egypt handing back an Israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.\nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak has described Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as the best chance for the Palestinians to achieve peace. The government in Cairo now believes Mr Sharon is moving towards the centre and away from the positions of right wing groups. It also believes the US, pressed by Europe, is now more willing to engage seriously in the search for a settlement. But there are also pressing economic reasons for Egypt's decision to enter into the trade agreement. It will give a huge boost to Egyptian textile exports, which are about to suffer a drop after new regulations come into force in the US at the beginning of the year.",
    "Life insurer Axa Sun Life has lowered annual bonus payouts for up to 50,000 with-profits investors.\nRegular annual bonus rates on former Axa Equity & Law with-profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004. Axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002. The cut will hit an estimated 3% of Axa's policyholders. The rest will know their fate in March.\nThe cuts on Axa's policies will mean a policyholder who had invested £50 a month into an endowment policy for the past 25 years would see a final maturity payout of £46,998. This equated to a annual investment growth rate of 8% Axa said. With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. However, heavy stock market falls throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. \"The stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002,\" Axa spokesman Mark Hamilton, Axa spokesman, told BBC News. Axa cut payouts for the same investors last January.",

Awake,\nMy fairest, my espoused, my latest found,\nHeaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!\nAwake:  The morning shines, and the fresh field\nCalls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring\nOur tender plants, how blows the citron grove,\nWhat drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,\nHow nature paints her colours, how the bee\nSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.\nSuch whispering waked her, but with startled eye\nOn Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.\nO sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,\nMy glory, my perfection! glad I see\nThy face, and morn returned; for I this night\n(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,\nIf dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,\nWorks of day past, or morrow's next design,\nBut of offence and trouble, which my mind\nKnew never till this irksome night:  Methought,\nClose at mine ear one called me forth to walk\nWith gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said,\n'Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,\n'The cool, the silent, save where silence yields\n'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake\n'Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns\n'Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light\n'Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,\n'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,\n'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?\n'In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment\n'Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.'\nI rose as at thy call, but found thee not;\nTo find thee I directed then my walk;\nAnd on, methought, alone I passed through ways\nThat brought me on a sudden to the tree\nOf interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,\nMuch fairer to my fancy than by day:\nAnd, as I wondering looked, beside it stood\nOne shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven\nBy us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled\nAmbrosia; on that tree he also gazed;\nAnd 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged,\n'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,\n'Nor God, nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised?\n'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?\n'Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold\n'Longer thy offered good; why else set here?\nThis said, he paused not, but with venturous arm\nHe plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled\nAt such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:\nBut he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine,\n'Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,\n'Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit\n'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:\n'And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more\n'Communicated, more abundant grows,\n'The author not impaired, but honoured more?\n'Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!\n'Partake thou also; happy though thou art,\n'Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:\n'Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods\n'Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,\n'But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes\n'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see\n'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!'\nSo saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,\nEven to my mouth of that same fruit held part\nWhich he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell\nSo quickened appetite, that I, methought,\nCould not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds\nWith him I flew, and underneath beheld\nThe earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide\nAnd various:  Wondering at my flight and change\nTo this high exaltation; suddenly\nMy guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,\nAnd fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked\nTo find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night\nRelated, and thus Adam answered sad.\nBest image of myself, and dearer half,\nThe trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep\nAffects me equally; nor can I like\nThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;\nYet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,\nCreated pure.  But know that in the soul\nAre many lesser faculties, that serve\nReason as chief; among these Fancy next\nHer office holds; of all external things\nWhich the five watchful senses represent,\nShe forms imaginations, aery shapes,\nWhich Reason, joining or disjoining, frames\nAll what we affirm or what deny, and call\nOur knowledge or opinion; then retires\nInto her private cell, when nature rests.\nOft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes\nTo imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,\nWild work produces oft, and most in dreams;\nIll matching words and deeds long past or late.\nSome such resemblances, methinks, I find\nOf our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,\nBut with addition strange; yet be not sad.\nEvil into the mind of God or Man\nMay come and go, so unreproved, and leave\nNo spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope\nThat what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,\nWaking thou never will consent to do.\nBe not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,\nThat wont to be more cheerful and serene,\nThan when fair morning first smiles on the world;\nAnd let us to our fresh employments rise\nAmong the groves, the fountains, and the flowers\nThat open now their choisest bosomed smells,\nReserved from night, and kept for thee in store.\nSo cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;\nBut silently a gentle tear let fall\nFrom either eye, and wiped them with her hair;\nTwo other precious drops that ready stood,\nEach in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell\nKissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse\nAnd pious awe, that feared to have offended.\nSo all was cleared, and to the field they haste.\nBut first, from under shady arborous roof\nSoon as they forth were come to open sight\nOf day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,\nWith wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,\nShot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,\nDiscovering in wide landskip all the east\nOf Paradise and Eden's happy plains,\nLowly they bowed adoring, and began\nTheir orisons, each morning duly paid\nIn various style; for neither various style\nNor holy rapture wanted they to praise\nTheir Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung\nUnmeditated; such prompt eloquence\nFlowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,\nMore tuneable than needed lute or harp\nTo add more sweetness; and they thus began.\nThese are thy glorious works, Parent of good,\nAlmighty!  Thine this universal frame,\nThus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then!\nUnspeakable, who sitst above these heavens\nTo us invisible, or dimly seen\nIn these thy lowest works; yet these declare\nThy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.\nSpeak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,\nAngels; for ye behold him, and with songs\nAnd choral symphonies, day without night,\nCircle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven\nOn Earth join all ye Creatures to extol\nHim first, him last, him midst, and without end.\nFairest of stars, last in the train of night,\nIf better thou belong not to the dawn,\nSure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn\nWith thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,\nWhile day arises, that sweet hour of prime.\nThou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,\nAcknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise\nIn thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,\nAnd when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.\nMoon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,\nWith the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;\nAnd ye five other wandering Fires, that move\nIn mystick dance not without song, resound\nHis praise, who out of darkness called up light.\nAir, and ye Elements, the eldest birth\nOf Nature's womb, that in quaternion run\nPerpetual circle, multiform; and mix\nAnd nourish all things; let your ceaseless change\nVary to our great Maker still new praise.\nYe Mists and Exhalations, that now rise\nFrom hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,\nTill the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,\nIn honour to the world's great Author rise;\nWhether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,\nOr wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,\nRising or falling still advance his praise.\nHis praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,\nBreathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,\nWith every plant, in sign of worship wave.\nFountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,\nMelodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.\nJoin voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds,\nThat singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,\nBear on your wings and in your notes his praise.\nYe that in waters glide, and ye that walk\nThe earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;\nWitness if I be silent, morn or even,\nTo hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,\nMade vocal by my song, and taught his praise.\nHail, universal Lord, be bounteous still\nTo give us only good; and if the night\nHave gathered aught of evil, or concealed,\nDisperse it, as now light dispels the dark!\nSo prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts\nFirm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.\nOn to their morning's rural work they haste,\nAmong sweet dews and flowers; where any row\nOf fruit-trees over-woody reached too far\nTheir pampered boughs, and needed hands to check\nFruitless embraces: or they led the vine\nTo wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines\nHer marriageable arms, and with him brings\nHer dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn\nHis barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld\nWith pity Heaven's high King, and to him called\nRaphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned\nTo travel with Tobias, and secured\nHis marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.\nRaphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth\nSatan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,\nHath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed\nThis night the human pair; how he designs\nIn them at once to ruin all mankind.\nGo therefore, half this day as friend with friend\nConverse with Adam, in what bower or shade\nThou findest him from the heat of noon retired,\nTo respite his day-labour with repast,\nOr with repose; and such discourse bring on,\nAs may advise him of his happy state,\nHappiness in his power left free to will,\nLeft to his own free will, his will though free,\nYet mutable; whence warn him to beware\nHe swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal\nHis danger, and from whom; what enemy,\nLate fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now\nThe fall of others from like state of bliss;\nBy violence? no, for that shall be withstood;\nBut by deceit and lies:  This let him know,\nLest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend\nSurprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.\nSo spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled\nAll justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint\nAfter his charge received; but from among\nThousand celestial Ardours, where he stood\nVeiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,\nFlew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,\nOn each hand parting, to his speed gave way\nThrough all the empyreal road; till, at the gate\nOf Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide\nOn golden hinges turning, as by work\nDivine the sovran Architect had framed.\nFrom hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,\nStar interposed, however small he sees,\nNot unconformed to other shining globes,\nEarth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned\nAbove all hills.  As when by night the glass\nOf Galileo, less assured, observes\nImagined lands and regions in the moon:\nOr pilot, from amidst the Cyclades\nDelos or Samos first appearing, kens\nA cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight\nHe speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky\nSails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing\nNow on the polar winds, then with quick fan\nWinnows the buxom air; till, within soar\nOf towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems\nA phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,\nWhen, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's\nBright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.\nAt once on the eastern cliff of Paradise\nHe lights, and to his proper shape returns\nA Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade\nHis lineaments divine; the pair that clad\nEach shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast\nWith regal ornament; the middle pair\nGirt like a starry zone his waist, and round\nSkirted his loins and thighs with downy gold\nAnd colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet\nShadowed from either heel with feathered mail,\nSky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood,\nAnd shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled\nThe circuit wide.  Straight knew him all the bands\nOf Angels under watch; and to his state,\nAnd to his message high, in honour rise;\nFor on some message high they guessed him bound.\nTheir glittering tents he passed, and now is come\nInto the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,\nAnd flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;\nA wilderness of sweets; for Nature here\nWantoned as in her prime, and played at will\nHer virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,\nWild above rule or art, enormous bliss.\nHim through the spicy forest onward come\nAdam discerned, as in the door he sat\nOf his cool bower, while now the mounted sun\nShot down direct his fervid rays to warm\nEarth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:\nAnd Eve within, due at her hour prepared\nFor dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please\nTrue appetite, and not disrelish thirst\nOf nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,\nBerry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called.\nHaste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold\nEastward among those trees, what glorious shape\nComes this way moving; seems another morn\nRisen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven\nTo us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe\nThis day to be our guest.  But go with speed,\nAnd, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour\nAbundance, fit to honour and receive\nOur heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford\nOur givers their own gifts, and large bestow\nFrom large bestowed, where Nature multiplies\nHer fertile growth, and by disburthening grows\nMore fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.\nTo whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould,\nOf God inspired! small store will serve, where store,\nAll seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;\nSave what by frugal storing firmness gains\nTo nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:\nBut I will haste, and from each bough and brake,\nEach plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice\nTo entertain our Angel-guest, as he\nBeholding shall confess, that here on Earth\nGod hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.\nSo saying, with dispatchful looks in haste\nShe turns, on hospitable thoughts intent\nWhat choice to choose for delicacy best,\nWhat order, so contrived as not to mix\nTastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring\nTaste after taste upheld with kindliest change;\nBestirs her then, and from each tender stalk\nWhatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields\nIn India East or West, or middle shore\nIn Pontus or the Punick coast, or where\nAlcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat\nRough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,\nShe gathers, tribute large, and on the board\nHeaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape\nShe crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths\nFrom many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed\nShe tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold\nWants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground\nWith rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.\nMean while our primitive great sire, to meet\nHis God-like guest, walks forth, without more train\nAccompanied than with his own complete\nPerfections; in himself was all his state,\nMore solemn than the tedious pomp that waits\nOn princes, when their rich retinue long\nOf horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,\nDazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.\nNearer his presence Adam, though not awed,\nYet with submiss approach and reverence meek,\nAs to a superiour nature bowing low,\nThus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place\nNone can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;\nSince, by descending from the thrones above,\nThose happy places thou hast deigned a while\nTo want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us\nTwo only, who yet by sovran gift possess\nThis spacious ground, in yonder shady bower\nTo rest; and what the garden choicest bears\nTo sit and taste, till this meridian heat\nBe over, and the sun more cool decline.\nWhom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.\nAdam, I therefore came; nor art thou such\nCreated, or such place hast here to dwell,\nAs may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,\nTo visit thee; lead on then where thy bower\nO'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,\nI have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge\nThey came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,\nWith flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,\nUndecked save with herself, more lovely fair\nThan Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned\nOf three that in mount Ida naked strove,\nStood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil\nShe needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm\nAltered her cheek.  On whom the Angel Hail\nBestowed, the holy salutation used\nLong after to blest Mary, second Eve.\nHail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb\nShall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,\nThan with these various fruits the trees of God\nHave heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf\nTheir table was, and mossy seats had round,\nAnd on her ample square from side to side\nAll autumn piled, though spring and autumn here\nDanced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;\nNo fear lest dinner cool; when thus began\nOur author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste\nThese bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom\nAll perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,\nTo us for food and for delight hath caused\nThe earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps\nTo spiritual natures; only this I know,\nThat one celestial Father gives to all.\nTo whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives\n(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part\nSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be found\nNo ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure\nIntelligential substances require,\nAs doth your rational; and both contain\nWithin them every lower faculty\nOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,\nTasting concoct, digest, assimilate,\nAnd corporeal to incorporeal turn.\nFor know, whatever was created, needs\nTo be sustained and fed:  Of elements\nThe grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,\nEarth and the sea feed air, the air those fires\nEthereal, and as lowest first the moon;\nWhence in her visage round those spots, unpurged\nVapours not yet into her substance turned.\nNor doth the moon no nourishment exhale\nFrom her moist continent to higher orbs.\nThe sun that light imparts to all, receives\nFrom all his alimental recompence\nIn humid exhalations, and at even\nSups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees\nOf life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines\nYield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn\nWe brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground\nCovered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here\nVaried his bounty so with new delights,\nAs may compare with Heaven; and to taste\nThink not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,\nAnd to their viands fell; nor seemingly\nThe Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss\nOf Theologians; but with keen dispatch\nOf real hunger, and concoctive heat\nTo transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires\nThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire\nOf sooty coal the empirick alchemist\nCan turn, or holds it possible to turn,\nMetals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,\nAs from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve\nMinistered naked, and their flowing cups\nWith pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence\nDeserving Paradise! if ever, then,\nThen had the sons of God excuse to have been\nEnamoured at that sight; but in those hearts\nLove unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy\nWas understood, the injured lover's hell.\nThus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,\nNot burdened nature, sudden mind arose\nIn Adam, not to let the occasion pass\nGiven him by this great conference to know\nOf things above his world, and of their being\nWho dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw\nTranscend his own so far; whose radiant forms,\nDivine effulgence, whose high power, so far\nExceeded human; and his wary speech\nThus to the empyreal minister he framed.\nInhabitant with God, now know I well\nThy favour, in this honour done to Man;\nUnder whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed\nTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,\nFood not of Angels, yet accepted so,\nAs that more willingly thou couldst not seem\nAt Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare\nTo whom the winged Hierarch replied.\nO Adam, One Almighty is, from whom\nAll things proceed, and up to him return,\nIf not depraved from good, created all\nSuch to perfection, one first matter all,\nEndued with various forms, various degrees\nOf substance, and, in things that live, of life;\nBut more refined, more spiritous, and pure,\nAs nearer to him placed, or nearer tending\nEach in their several active spheres assigned,\nTill body up to spirit work, in bounds\nProportioned to each kind.  So from the root\nSprings lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves\nMore aery, last the bright consummate flower\nSpirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,\nMan's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,\nTo vital spirits aspire, to animal,\nTo intellectual; give both life and sense,\nFancy and understanding; whence the soul\nReason receives, and reason is her being,\nDiscursive, or intuitive; discourse\nIs oftest yours, the latter most is ours,\nDiffering but in degree, of kind the same.\nWonder not then, what God for you saw good\nIf I refuse not, but convert, as you\nTo proper substance.  Time may come, when Men\nWith Angels may participate, and find\nNo inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;\nAnd from these corporal nutriments perhaps\nYour bodies may at last turn all to spirit,\nImproved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend\nEthereal, as we; or may, at choice,\nHere or in heavenly Paradises dwell;\nIf ye be found obedient, and retain\nUnalterably firm his love entire,\nWhose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy\nYour fill what happiness this happy state\nCan comprehend, incapable of more.\nTo whom the patriarch of mankind replied.\nO favourable Spirit, propitious guest,\nWell hast thou taught the way that might direct\nOur knowledge, and the scale of nature set\nFrom center to circumference; whereon,\nIn contemplation of created things,\nBy steps we may ascend to God.  But say,\nWhat meant that caution joined, If ye be found\nObedient?  Can we want obedience then\nTo him, or possibly his love desert,\nWho formed us from the dust and placed us here\nFull to the utmost measure of what bliss\nHuman desires can seek or apprehend?\nTo whom the Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth,\nAttend!  That thou art happy, owe to God;\nThat thou continuest such, owe to thyself,\nThat is, to thy obedience; therein stand.\nThis was that caution given thee; be advised.\nGod made thee perfect, not immutable;\nAnd good he made thee, but to persevere\nHe left it in thy power; ordained thy will\nBy nature free, not over-ruled by fate\nInextricable, or strict necessity:\nOur voluntary service he requires,\nNot our necessitated; such with him\nFinds no acceptance, nor can find; for how\nCan hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve\nWilling or no, who will but what they must\nBy destiny, and can no other choose?\nMyself, and all the angelick host, that stand\nIn sight of God, enthroned, our happy state\nHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;\nOn other surety none:  Freely we serve,\nBecause we freely love, as in our will\nTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:\nAnd some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,\nAnd so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall\nFrom what high state of bliss, into what woe!\nTo whom our great progenitor.  Thy words\nAttentive, and with more delighted ear,\nDivine instructer, I have heard, than when\nCherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills\nAereal musick send:  Nor knew I not\nTo be both will and deed created free;\nYet that we never shall forget to love\nOur Maker, and obey him whose command\nSingle is yet so just, my constant thoughts\nAssured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest\nHath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,\nBut more desire to hear, if thou consent,\nThe full relation, which must needs be strange,\nWorthy of sacred silence to be heard;\nAnd we have yet large day, for scarce the sun\nHath finished half his journey, and scarce begins\nHis other half in the great zone of Heaven.\nThus Adam made request; and Raphael,\nAfter short pause assenting, thus began.\nHigh matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,\nSad task and hard:  For how shall I relate\nTo human sense the invisible exploits\nOf warring Spirits? how, without remorse,\nThe ruin of so many glorious once\nAnd perfect while they stood? how last unfold\nThe secrets of another world, perhaps\nNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy good\nThis is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach\nOf human sense, I shall delineate so,\nBy likening spiritual to corporal forms,\nAs may express them best; though what if Earth\nBe but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein\nEach to other like, more than on earth is thought?\nAs yet this world was not, and Chaos wild\nReigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests\nUpon her center poised; when on a day\n(For time, though in eternity, applied\nTo motion, measures all things durable\nBy present, past, and future,) on such day\nAs Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host\nOf Angels by imperial summons called,\nInnumerable before the Almighty's throne\nForthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared\nUnder their Hierarchs in orders bright:\nTen thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,\nStandards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear\nStream in the air, and for distinction serve\nOf hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;\nOr in their glittering tissues bear imblazed\nHoly memorials, acts of zeal and love\nRecorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs\nOf circuit inexpressible they stood,\nOrb within orb, the Father Infinite,\nBy whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,\nAmidst as from a flaming mount, whose top\nBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.\nHear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nHear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.\nThis day I have begot whom I declare\nMy only Son, and on this holy hill\nHim have anointed, whom ye now behold\nAt my right hand; your head I him appoint;\nAnd by myself have sworn, to him shall bow\nAll knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:\nUnder his great vice-gerent reign abide\nUnited, as one individual soul,\nFor ever happy:  Him who disobeys,\nMe disobeys, breaks union, and that day,\nCast out from God and blessed vision, falls\nInto utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place\nOrdained without redemption, without end.\nSo spake the Omnipotent, and with his words\nAll seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.\nThat day, as other solemn days, they spent\nIn song and dance about the sacred hill;\nMystical dance, which yonder starry sphere\nOf planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels\nResembles nearest, mazes intricate,\nEccentrick, intervolved, yet regular\nThen most, when most irregular they seem;\nAnd in their motions harmony divine\nSo smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear\nListens delighted.  Evening now approached,\n(For we have also our evening and our morn,\nWe ours for change delectable, not need;)\nForthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn\nDesirous; all in circles as they stood,\nTables are set, and on a sudden piled\nWith Angels food, and rubied nectar flows\nIn pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,\nFruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.\nOn flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,\nThey eat, they drink, and in communion sweet\nQuaff immortality and joy, secure\nOf surfeit, where full measure only bounds\nExcess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered\nWith copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.\nNow when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled\nFrom that high mount of God, whence light and shade\nSpring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed\nTo grateful twilight, (for night comes not there\nIn darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed\nAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;\nWide over all the plain, and wider far\nThan all this globous earth in plain outspread,\n(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,\nDispersed in bands and files, their camp extend\nBy living streams among the trees of life,\nPavilions numberless, and sudden reared,\nCelestial tabernacles, where they slept\nFanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,\nMelodious hymns about the sovran throne\nAlternate all night long: but not so waked\nSatan; so call him now, his former name\nIs heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,\nIf not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,\nIn favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught\nWith envy against the Son of God, that day\nHonoured by his great Father, and proclaimed\nMessiah King anointed, could not bear\nThrough pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.\nDeep malice thence conceiving and disdain,\nSoon as midnight brought on the dusky hour\nFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved\nWith all his legions to dislodge, and leave\nUnworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,\nContemptuous; and his next subordinate\nAwakening, thus to him in secret spake.\nSleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close\nThy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree\nOf yesterday, so late hath passed the lips\nOf Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy thoughts\nWast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;\nBoth waking we were one; how then can now\nThy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed;\nNew laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise\nIn us who serve, new counsels to debate\nWhat doubtful may ensue:  More in this place\nTo utter is not safe.  Assemble thou\nOf all those myriads which we lead the chief;\nTell them, that by command, ere yet dim night\nHer shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,\nAnd all who under me their banners wave,\nHomeward, with flying march, where we possess\nThe quarters of the north; there to prepare\nFit entertainment to receive our King,\nThe great Messiah, and his new commands,\nWho speedily through all the hierarchies\nIntends to pass triumphant, and give laws.\nSo spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused\nBad influence into the unwary breast\nOf his associate:  He together calls,\nOr several one by one, the regent Powers,\nUnder him Regent; tells, as he was taught,\nThat the Most High commanding, now ere night,\nNow ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,\nThe great hierarchal standard was to move;\nTells the suggested cause, and casts between\nAmbiguous words and jealousies, to sound\nOr taint integrity:  But all obeyed\nThe wonted signal, and superiour voice\nOf their great Potentate; for great indeed\nHis name, and high was his degree in Heaven;\nHis countenance, as the morning-star that guides\nThe starry flock, allured them, and with lies\nDrew after him the third part of Heaven's host.\nMean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns\nAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,\nAnd from within the golden lamps that burn\nNightly before him, saw without their light\nRebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread\nAmong the sons of morn, what multitudes\nWere banded to oppose his high decree;\nAnd, smiling, to his only Son thus said.\nSon, thou in whom my glory I behold\nIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might,\nNearly it now concerns us to be sure\nOf our Omnipotence, and with what arms\nWe mean to hold what anciently we claim\nOf deity or empire:  Such a foe\nIs rising, who intends to erect his throne\nEqual to ours, throughout the spacious north;\nNor so content, hath in his thought to try\nIn battle, what our power is, or our right.\nLet us advise, and to this hazard draw\nWith speed what force is left, and all employ\nIn our defence; lest unawares we lose\nThis our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.\nTo whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,\nLightning divine, ineffable, serene,\nMade answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes\nJustly hast in derision, and, secure,\nLaughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,\nMatter to me of glory, whom their hate\nIllustrates, when they see all regal power\nGiven me to quell their pride, and in event\nKnow whether I be dextrous to subdue\nThy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.\nSo spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,\nFar was advanced on winged speed; an host\nInnumerable as the stars of night,\nOr stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun\nImpearls on every leaf and every flower.\nRegions they passed, the mighty regencies\nOf Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,\nIn their triple degrees; regions to which\nAll thy dominion, Adam, is no more\nThan what this garden is to all the earth,\nAnd all the sea, from one entire globose\nStretched into longitude; which having passed,\nAt length into the limits of the north\nThey came; and Satan to his royal seat\nHigh on a hill, far blazing, as a mount\nRaised on a mount, with pyramids and towers\nFrom diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;\nThe palace of great Lucifer, (so call\nThat structure in the dialect of men\nInterpreted,) which not long after, he\nAffecting all equality with God,\nIn imitation of that mount whereon\nMessiah was declared in sight of Heaven,\nThe Mountain of the Congregation called;\nFor thither he assembled all his train,\nPretending so commanded to consult\nAbout the great reception of their King,\nThither to come, and with calumnious art\nOf counterfeited truth thus held their ears.\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nIf these magnifick titles yet remain\nNot merely titular, since by decree\nAnother now hath to himself engrossed\nAll power, and us eclipsed under the name\nOf King anointed, for whom all this haste\nOf midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,\nThis only to consult how we may best,\nWith what may be devised of honours new,\nReceive him coming to receive from us\nKnee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!\nToo much to one! but double how endured,\nTo one, and to his image now proclaimed?\nBut what if better counsels might erect\nOur minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?\nWill ye submit your necks, and choose to bend\nThe supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust\nTo know ye right, or if ye know yourselves\nNatives and sons of Heaven possessed before\nBy none; and if not equal all, yet free,\nEqually free; for orders and degrees\nJar not with liberty, but well consist.\nWho can in reason then, or right, assume\nMonarchy over such as live by right\nHis equals, if in power and splendour less,\nIn freedom equal? or can introduce\nLaw and edict on us, who without law\nErr not? much less for this to be our Lord,\nAnd look for adoration, to the abuse\nOf those imperial titles, which assert\nOur being ordained to govern, not to serve.\nThus far his bold discourse without controul\nHad audience; when among the Seraphim\nAbdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored\nThe Deity, and divine commands obeyed,\nStood up, and in a flame of zeal severe\nThe current of his fury thus opposed.\nO argument blasphemous, false, and proud!\nWords which no ear ever to hear in Heaven\nExpected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate,\nIn place thyself so high above thy peers.\nCanst thou with impious obloquy condemn\nThe just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,\nThat to his only Son, by right endued\nWith regal scepter, every soul in Heaven\nShall bend the knee, and in that honour due\nConfess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,\nFlatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,\nAnd equal over equals to let reign,\nOne over all with unsucceeded power.\nShalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute\nWith him the points of liberty, who made\nThee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven\nSuch as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?\nYet, by experience taught, we know how good,\nAnd of our good and of our dignity\nHow provident he is; how far from thought\nTo make us less, bent rather to exalt\nOur happy state, under one head more near\nUnited.  But to grant it thee unjust,\nThat equal over equals monarch reign:\nThyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,\nOr all angelick nature joined in one,\nEqual to him begotten Son? by whom,\nAs by his Word, the Mighty Father made\nAll things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven\nBy him created in their bright degrees,\nCrowned them with glory, and to their glory named\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,\nEssential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,\nBut more illustrious made; since he the head\nOne of our number thus reduced becomes;\nHis laws our laws; all honour to him done\nReturns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,\nAnd tempt not these; but hasten to appease\nThe incensed Father, and the incensed Son,\nWhile pardon may be found in time besought.\nSo spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal\nNone seconded, as out of season judged,\nOr singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced\nThe Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.\nThat we were formed then sayest thou? and the work\nOf secondary hands, by task transferred\nFrom Father to his Son? strange point and new!\nDoctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw\nWhen this creation was? rememberest thou\nThy making, while the Maker gave thee being?\nWe know no time when we were not as now;\nKnow none before us, self-begot, self-raised\nBy our own quickening power, when fatal course\nHad circled his full orb, the birth mature\nOf this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.\nOur puissance is our own; our own right hand\nShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try\nWho is our equal:  Then thou shalt behold\nWhether by supplication we intend\nAddress, and to begirt the almighty throne\nBeseeching or besieging.  This report,\nThese tidings carry to the anointed King;\nAnd fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.\nHe said; and, as the sound of waters deep,\nHoarse murmur echoed to his words applause\nThrough the infinite host; nor less for that\nThe flaming Seraph fearless, though alone\nEncompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.\nO alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,\nForsaken of all good!  I see thy fall\nDetermined, and thy hapless crew involved\nIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spread\nBoth of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth\nNo more be troubled how to quit the yoke\nOf God's Messiah; those indulgent laws\nWill not be now vouchsafed; other decrees\nAgainst thee are gone forth without recall;\nThat golden scepter, which thou didst reject,\nIs now an iron rod to bruise and break\nThy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise;\nYet not for thy advice or threats I fly\nThese wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath\nImpendent, raging into sudden flame,\nDistinguish not:  For soon expect to feel\nHis thunder on thy head, devouring fire.\nThen who created thee lamenting learn,\nWhen who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.\nSo spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found\nAmong the faithless, faithful only he;\nAmong innumerable false, unmoved,\nUnshaken, unseduced, unterrified,\nHis loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;\nNor number, nor example, with him wrought\nTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,\nThough single.  From amidst them forth he passed,\nLong way through hostile scorn, which he sustained\nSuperiour, nor of violence feared aught;\nAnd, with retorted scorn, his back he turned\nOn those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.",

In a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat butter, oil, and both sugars until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla until it is combined. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Mix to combine. Gently stir in the peeled, shredded apples. Generously grease and flour a standard size bundt cake pan. Transfer the batter to the bundt pan and use a spatula to gently even out the top. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes before flipping the cake to remove the cake from the pan. Completely cool the cake on a wire rack. You can freeze the cake before icing by wrapping the cooled cake tightly in plastic wrap. For the maple glaze: Sift the icing sugar into a small bowl. This will prevent any lumps in your icing. Add the milk and maple extract. Mix well to combine. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake.",

In a microwave-safe bowl, combine butter, milk and water. Heat for 2 minutes. Test with your finger; if the mixture is too hot to the touch, it will be too hot for your yeast. Add liquid ingredients to the dry mixture. Mix. Now add the eggs and mix well. Add 6 cups of flour. This will give you a very sticky dough. Add 2 1/2 cups of flour and knead in. Knead for 5 minutes. Your dough will be still be a little sticky. Add the oil to a bowl and roll your dough in it. Let rise for 2 hours, punch down and rise for another hour. For the filling: Divide your dough in half. Take one half and split it into 3 sections. You will need to roll this out in a long oval. Spread a little melted butter across the dough. You do not want too much or it will make your dough very soggy. Mix cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg together. Now sprinkle your mixture of sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg over the dough. (Don't use too much. This mixture will make two whole braids or 6 rolled out sections.) Once you have done this, roll up the dough. Now do this two more times. Once you have 3 pieces done, braid them together. Do the other half to the dough the same way. Tuck the ends under and let rise for 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees for 28 to 30 minutes. This recipe makes two braids! For the glaze: Mix the melted butter, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla together. Take a spoon and drizzle over a cooled braid. Top with pecans and 3 cherries. Serve with coffee, milk or orange juice on Christmas morning. This is AMAZING!",
    "1 1/2 Tbl. grated ginger\n1 lemon\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 teaspoon yeast\ncool water\nclean 2-liter bottle or growler jug\n1. Juice the lemon and set it aside.  2. Pour the sugar into the bottle.  4. Pour the yeast into the bottle. Shake the bottle so that the yeast and sugar are mixed well.  5. Pour the ginger and the lemon juice into the bottle.  6. Fill the bottle about one-quarter full of cold water and shake well again, so that everything's mixed well and the sugar and yeast are dissolved.  7. Fill up the bottle with water until nearly but not quite full, leaving an inch or two of space from the lid.  8. Leave out the bottle in a warm spot for 2-3 days, or until it's carbonated to the degree you want. Then chill the ginger ale in the fridge and enjoy. (You'll probably want to filter the ginger ale as you pour it into the glass. Otherwise you'll get little bits of grated ginger stuck on your lips.)  Warning: If you leave the bottle too long in the warmth, you risk the bottle exploding.  Feel free to fiddle around with the amounts of ginger, lemon or sugar, as you like. Personally, I've found that 1 cup of sugar seems the perfect amount, for me, at least. Even a scant bit less makes the soda bland; a little bit more gets syrupy sweet.",
    "3 cups all-purpose flour\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n1 3/4 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n1 large egg\n6 tablespoons ice water\n1. Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and mix together with your fingertips or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. 2. Mix the egg with the water in a small bowl. Toss the mixture gently with the butter mixture until the dough comes together; do not overwork it. Divide the dough in half. Flatten each half with the palm of your hand to form a thick disk. Wrap both disks in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. 3. Remove 1 disk of dough from the refrigerator. Unwrap it and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface or between 2 sheets of wax paper to form a circle about 1/8-inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pie plate. Work quickly, as the dough can become sticky. 4. Use a spatula to help lift the dough and fold it loosely in half, then in quarters. Gently transfer the dough to the pie plate, placing the corner of the dough in the center of the plate. Open up the dough and press it lightly into the plate to fit. (If the dough should tear, just press it gently together.) Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. 5. Repeat the rolling process with the second disk of dough to make the top crust. The circle of the top crust should be 10 inches in diameter.",
    "1 chicken carcass or leftover bones from several legs, wings etc.\n1 stalk celery\n1 onion\n1 carrot\n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed (optional)\n3-4 cloves garlic, crushed (optional)\n1 bunch fresh thyme or 2-3 tsp dry\nPut everything in a big pot. Pour in enough water to cover the bones and veggies. Bring to a boil then turn to low heat. Skim off any foamy stuff that comes to the top of the broth. Simmer for about 3 hours (split up the time throughout the day if necessary - if you can watch the stove so long). Check periodically to stir up a little and add more water if it has evaporated too much (keep it at the level you started). After cooking, remove all the big pieces of chicken bones and vegetables with tongs or a spoon. There's no more flavor left in the vegetables or meat, so you can discard. The broth should look golden and delicious :) Let cool then strain out the broth to get rid of any small pieces of veggies, etc. and put in a big tupperware, or jar. If freezing, store in a freezer safe container or zip-lock bags after cooling. One easy way to use the fresh broth right away is to make a vegetable soup! Cut up your favorite veggies into small pieces (I used onion, celery, carrots, potatoes and cauliflower). Saute the veggies in a little olive oil, then pour in some broth to cover. Cook until vegetables are tender. This is also great to add noodles (and leftover chicken) too for chicken noodle soup!",

Add the salt and sugar and cook until dissolved. Add the fennel seeds, garlic, thyme and fennel fronds and remove from the heat. Let cool completely (or reduce the amount of water in the brine by 2 cups and add 4 cups ice cubes to cool down immediately). Transfer the brine to a plastic container, add the pork, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. For the smoked pork: Remove the pork from the brine, rinse well with cold water and pat dry. Put on a rack set over a baking sheet and refrigerate (to allow a crust, or skin, to form on the outside) for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours. Remove the grill grate and ceramic plate from the cooker. Add the hot hardwood charcoal and scatter the soaked wood chips over the top. Put on the ceramic plate and the grill rack, close the cover, bring the temperature to between 300 and 325 degrees F and allow to smoke for 10 minutes. Brush the entire loin with oil and sprinkle with pepper. Place on the rack, close the cover and smoke at 140 degrees F until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers, 1 to 1 hour 30 minutes. While the pork smokes, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey. Start brushing it on the pork about 30 minutes before it is done. When done, remove, loosely tent and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. For the fennel gremolata: Cut the fennel into small dice and coarsely chop the fronds; put in a bowl. Add the zest and juice and drizzle with a little olive oil; mix to combine. Let sit at room temperature.

Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy and begins to smell of yeast. Add the flour and butter to the yeast mixture. Attach the dough hook to the stand mixer and, on medium-low speed, combine the mixture until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and appears shiny, roughly 4 to 5 minutes. Spray a large bowl with non-stick spray (or lightly grease with vegetable oil) and place dough in greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Place bowl in a warm area and let dough rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Place an oven rack in the top third of your oven, and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Spray parchment paper with non-stick spray. Set aside. In a large pot, bring the 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a rolling boil. Place the dough on a greased surface, and divide into 16 equal pieces (If you weigh dough, like I do, they will be about 2.20 oz. each). Roll each piece into a long rope, roughly 12 inches long. Carefully wrap half of each piece around a third of a hot dog. Pinch the ends together to seal the dough. If you run out of hot dogs before dough, make regular pretzels. Cut a little more dough off (3 oz.), and shape as desired. Place each shaped pretzel on the parchment lined baking sheet. Boil the shaped pretzels and pretzel dogs, one at a time, in the baking soda water for 30 seconds each. Using a slotted spatula or spider strainer, remove each pretzel dog from the water and place it on a drying rack to allow any extra baking soda mixture to drip off. Place the boiled pretzel dogs back on the parchment lined baking sheets. Brush with beaten egg yolk and sprinkle with pretzel or kosher salt. Bake until golden brown, roughly 10 1/2 minutes (14 to 15 minutes for large pretzels). Transfer pretzel dogs to a cooling rack for a few minutes before serving. Serve with a variety of mustards or cheese sauce.",

    "2 poblano/pasilla peppers\n1 onion, chopped\n3 fresh corn, kernels cut off\n1/2 cup chicken/veggie broth or water\nsplash cream/whole milk\n1/4 pound queso fresco, cubed\nChar the peppers. Poblano pepper skins have a slightly bitter taste so you need to get it off. In order to do this you have 2 options. If you have a gas stove that produces a flame, char the peppers over the flame until the skin is black and blistered over the whole pepper. I have an electric stove so what I do is set the oven to broil and move one of the racks up to the very top. Broil the peppers, rotating as soon as the skin by the broiler is black, until it's charred on all sides. Put the charred peppers in a plastic bag or in a bowl covered in plastic as soon as they're done being charred to steam it so the skin peels off easily. Peel the peppers. Some peppers are a little spicy so wearing gloves could be useful. Peel all the skin off the peppers. Then remove the stem, seeds and veins. Slice into strips. Heat some olive or vegetable oil over medium heat in a pan big enough to hold all the corn and peppers. Saute the onion until clear and fragrant. Add the corn kernels, peppers and broth. Simmer covered for about 15 minutes. Add the splash of cream and remove from heat. Stir in cheese and enjoy.",

Add the sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, orange zest and cloves and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for about an hour. In the meantime, make the chocolate sauce. Combine the chocolate and cream in a small saucepan and set over low heat. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is just melted, and then remove from the heat and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the vanilla, cinnamon and cayenne pepper. If necessary, whisk in a little bit of water to loosen the sauce. Set aside in a warm place. Pour about an inch of oil into a wide, shallow saucepan and set over medium-high heat. When a small piece of batter sizzles after you drop it into the oil, you are ready to fry. Drop rounded teaspoons of the batter into the oil in small batches and fry for about 2 minutes on each side, turning once, until golden brown. Drain the fritters on paper towels, dust with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately with the chocolate sauce (if it has thickened too much, you may need to reheat the sauce gently, whisking constantly, and add a bit more water).",
    "2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter\n1 1/4 cups superfine sugar\n4 cups all-purpose flour\nBlanched almonds or pistachio nuts to decorate\nCream the butter and beat it until it becomes white. Add the sugar, beating constantly for about 5 minutes, until it is a smooth cream. Add flour gradually, working it in by hand. Although no liquid is added, this makes a very soft dough. If the dough is too soft, add a little more flour. Take walnut-sized lumps, roll them into balls, and flatten them slightly. Place them on a baking sheet a little apart from each other, as they spread slightly. Stick a blanched almond or pistachio on top of each one. Bake in a 325F oven for 2030 minutes. Do not let the ghorayebah overcook. They must remain very white: they taste quite different if they are even slightly brown. Let them cool before you try to move them. An exquisite variation is to replace 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup ground hazelnuts. You can flavor the dough with a grating of nutmeg, or 12 teaspoons of cinnamon or ground cardamom. Another traditional shape for ghorayebah is little bracelets. Roll the dough into 4-inch-long sausage shapes about 1/2 inch thick, and bring the ends together to make bracelets. Decorate with split almonds or pistachios.",

But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

Dust mites are something I’ve always suspected but was not officially diagnosed with it until I took the test. Growing up, I’ve always had cold urticaria but that seem to have disappeared only to be replaced with sun sensitivity. And there’s so little known about PMLE like I just wanna know what’s going on with my body. I feel so helpless. I just wanna be out and sunbathe and not to be so itchy the next day.",
    "Me and my wife moved to Alabama to take care of my grandparents, my grandfather has dementia and my grandma, Well she just has a bad habit of not doing stuff and just praying everything will work out. They moved to Alabama to our current house to live with my great uncle. He passed away without an updated will while verbally he said the house was going to my grandparents his will was made in the 1990s. We got the house probated and my grandpa ended up being the owner of the estate. My grandma told me that they had it put in their name and that they were going to make a will. After my grandpa passed away I found out that they neither put the house in their name nor did they make a will. Dose my grandma inherit the estate of my great uncle? Or are we going to have to probate the house again?",
    "Kind of following up on my earlier post. I've managed to get Mech Assault's .xiso extracted and onto my console's hdd via ftp networking but it won't boot. Am I missing something? When I try to rip it with dvd2xbox, it says it failed to get like 5 out of 90 files. I've tried ripping it twice with the same results. I don't want to keep trying to rip it or play it off the disc and contribute to burning out my disc drive. Not sure why the install isn't working. Anything obvious I'm missing? I was also wondering if anyone has actually played Mech Assault on a modded og xbox. Maybe there's just a compatibility issue with Evo x and the game. The game boots up and plays just fine if I do try to play it off the disc and it doesn't look damaged so I don't think it's a problem with the disc",
    "Missing 411 cases fascinate me in part because they really come closest to feeling like the closest real-life analogue to a Cthulhu-esque horror. In the Cthulhu books, these types of beings were portrayed as completely alien and unfathomable, like there is no way to understand their intentions or desires, they are just on another level entirely. They are also irresistibly powerful, mere humans have no hope of overpowering them or defeating them. In Missing 411 cases, we have no idea why this is done to people and what they get out of it, but there is a clear intelligence to which victims are taken, when they are taken, and how they are taken. Also, the entity responsible seems to have no constraints, taking people even from crowded areas and always being able to avoid being witnessed by other people or even security cameras. The implications of this phenomena are utterly terrifying and fascinating.",

    "Hi everyone, I’ve been selling for just over a year, launched 3 relatively successful products, and recently launched a fourth in the health and beauty category which has been a complete disappointment. I felt I had done my research, had invested in great photos and spent time making a keyword rich listing, but found the lower price point to be far lower than I expected to get even one or two sales. Long term I am struggling to see how I can make profit margins when I include PPC/VAT. Seems like there is now an ongoing price war in the niche and I can’t see anyone making money. I can always try to drive external traffic sources, improve the listing and drive more reviews, but when do you decide it’s not worth the investment with this ASIN and move on? A lot of gurus online talk about their biggest “failures”, but I had always felt there was a solution to most challenges that can be overcome by improvements to the listing or advertising approach before giving up. At what point do people pull out of a product line and decide this is a “failure” and not worth further investment?",
    "I’ve been talking to this girl for a while now and even though she tells me that she feels comfortable with me, it doesn’t feel like she is. She doesn’t send many pictures of herself even though I do and I also tell her she’s very pretty when she sends a picture or when she turns her camera on when we call. But she just doesn’t seem very comfortable with showing her face a lot. Also sometimes I feel like maybe I’m too clingy and I just want to be talking to her all the time and maybe that makes her uncomfortable. I’m also very open about how I feel about us and how I hope that in the future we can be together and even though she has told me that she wants to be with me too, sometimes it doesn’t feel like it. I don’t know maybe I’m just overthinking the whole thing and she does want to be with me but she’s just not as open about her feelings as I am.",
    "I'm slowly starting back up in the dating pool after a long term relationship and I think that probably the worst part about it is I relocated due to my job, and the city I'm in is considered one of the worst in the US for trying to find a relationship. So many reports of how the hookup culture hears vastly outweighs the dating culture. Definitely made me a bit worried, but maybe I'll get lucky. Also, aside from how bad dating apps have gotten from all of the extra features that help less and the addition of triple the pay walls for some apps, is it just me or has the landscape gotten more kinky? I mean, I look around and there are so many who mention that they have a kink. It definitely makes me a proven vanilla that much harder to find someone out there, and I'm already looking in a smaller pool of potential dates since I would love someone on the more nerdy/geeky side",
    "I think the title is self explanatory. It’s true. When I have a crush I hate myself for having a crush on them. Because I know that I can’t do anything about it. And although I would like to confess I’m actually scared of them saying yes. Weird right? I mean I’m supposed to happy if my crush says yes to goin g out with me but for me it’s the opposite. Because I know that when we’re together all I’m going to think about is when we break up. Where I’m going to break up with them. What the reason should be for me breaking up with them. And how I should break up with them. And that feeling makes me feel so guilty because this precious person is giving me their all and here I am being a half-assed person. But I can’t help myself from having a crush, it just happens. I feel sorry for whoever I come to like and come to date. I feel like I’m going to be lonely until the end of time.",
    "So I spent a day with my boy bestfriend and we went out and got food and spoke and we just had fun. Later when we were at his house he was being really comfortable and he cuddled me and was being different. I felt bad for liking it and wanting to take it further. It felt wrong to be like that with him so I broke up with my boyfriend. But that wasn't the only reason I broke up with him, I realized I didn't want to kiss him or anything anymore and I feel like I subconsciously moved him back to \"friend\" in my mind. And I'm 17 and realized I didn't really want such a serious relationship right now, or a relationship at all rn. So after that my boy bestfriend made a move and now he wants a relationship but I don't, but I liked it when he kissed me. So I don't know what to do",
    "I believe that the tech market will be down on Monday. The report was quite positive, smashing expectations for new jobs. There is other stuff. But I see value stocks back in play for Monday. Rotation out of tech for a day or two, and then back into tech for April. The fact that the report was positive sounds positive overall, but more jobs means more workers, and more people being out and about and spending on basic necessities that they needed. I can’t imagine this translating to more spending on tech stocks. I think there’s still value in some tech stocks, which is why I say April will be green overall, but I’m talking Monday open after Easter. Historically seems to be more favored to a down day also. Thoughts?",
    "My mom notably would always say she was gonna “drive away from the house” and leave, and stuff similar to that. My parents would always fight and actually get in legitimate fights with each other and I remember once when I was younger, they made me pick between which parent I wanted to stay with because I thought they were moving away from each other. I used to look back on this stuff and not think it was horrible, I don’t even know if I think it’s horrible now because I’m used to it. I remember once my dad would chase me with his belt around a table, I don’t know why he did this but he did, I must’ve done something to deserve it.. I remember being beaten/hit by both of them for reasons i don’t even know. i think being afraid of saying something wrong and having my stuff taken away from me as a consequence transferred over to me being this antisocial person that has trouble talking and being vulnerable with people.. anyway enough rambling, does that stuff cause abandonment issues/other things?",
    "For those freaking out about the price differences, think of it in comparison to the credit bureaus. Your credit scores are not the same across the board. Each bureau has a different way of calculating your score, and some have different information. But eventually, it all all even up and be closer to one another. If you are already getting restless and impatient, maybe you shouldn’t be investing in crypto or stocks for that matter. Everyone needs to take a chill, sit back and enjoy the ride. Buy the dips if you want to get more, but hold on to your coins and let the system do the work for you. If you are super worried about losing money, just pull out your initial investment once you make money, and let your profit do the work. But you’re gonna regret it when it takes off and you sold potential millions.",
    "Brief as backstory. My mother is emotionally damaged, severely, not her fault, but resulted in an upbringing where by the age of 9 I was taken to a lot of psychologists to find out “ what was wrong with me”. I left home when I was 14, stayed an aunt until I was 17, moved out and made my own life. Fast forward 13 years, I have a degree, job, house, kids everything I wanted, 2 weeks ago my mum was supposed to be attending a family event but decided not to go, but wanted to come and visit my kids and stay at our house. It’s been 1.5 years since we saw her last so I said yes. She came, was her typical self, this time I felt sorry for her as supposed to getting angry at her for her behaviours - she’ll tell my daughter they’ll go do something then say no she’s too tired. Anyway, since she’s left, I cannot shake the feeling of how I used to feel when I was 14. Things were never good enough, I wasn’t going to go far in life, my achievements aren’t really achievements. Then she texts and asks about only ONE of her grandchildren, typical her behaviour. I’ve talked to my husband about it, I’ve trained hard at the gym gone for extra runs. I’m short with my own kids which isn’t usual for me, I cannot fathom why she is doing the exact same thing she did to me and my brothers now she’s trying to divide my kids, she knew exactly what she was doing, she’s horrible - asked multiple times when my second child’s birthday was. I can’t seem to calm down from this, like I say, I’ve reverted right back to 14 and all those feels associated with that and it sucks.",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "This is like day 5 and i woke up this morning with like no withdrawal symptoms and no cravings. I basically just took supplements, drank a lot of water and coffee, and smoked weed at night. Honestly i think the supplements are what helped the most I strongly encourage who ever is quitting to take ashwagandha, Htp-5, and Rhodiola Rosea Extract two of each twice a day. Its been giving me the biggest boosts of serotonin and as i did feel the withdrawal symptoms this dramatically reduced them. I’m telling you if you are struggling take these and you will feel soo much better. And also smoke weed or take CBD if you like, it kinda takes the edge off. But i like these supplements so much I’ll probably take them for a long time",
    "I use syncthing on my Android phone and my PC to sync photos and ebooks etc. I thought it might be a good idea to tell my client to then only sync when I'm on my home network to save a bit of battery when I'm out and about and need it more. I don't really need it to sync to my PC while I'm out anyway, I can wait for it to do so automatically when i get home. I enabled location permissions and got it working, but was bummed to find that out requires location to be on to figure out what network I'm connected to. I never turn my location on at home because I don't need to use GPS to find my way around my house, 😆. Seems a really weird and silly way for this to work. Why can't it tell what SSID I'm on and figure without turning on my GPS. Are there any good workarounds besides leaving sync on all the time or turning location on when I'm at home?",
    "I have been taking klonopijn daily for around 5 years now. Recently since the pandemic started and my life started to fall apart before my eyes, I was upped in my dosage. Then I was upped again, and again, and again. Now I am at the point of taking 6mg-8mg/day. It has gotten completely out of control and made my situation from covid even worse and less manageable. and I almost have no tolerance. I want to start a taper, not an aggressive one, that will help bring me back down to at least 1mg/day. Could this be done in a couple of months? If so does anyone have good taper recommendations. Furthermore, considering the stress will feel at times almost unbearable, does anyone know of any good anti stress replacements or anything that can be taken during this process?",
    "Argus new changes in the advanced server is really bad. This is due to his base Physical Atk and growth being nerfed significantly. Furthermore we got a stun duration nerf for a range buff, but a range buff wasn’t needed yet that stun duration is crucial and the reason why i would even call it argus best skill.  all of this huge nerfs just for passive being 320% yet this depends on his physical atk so the nerfs actually nerfs this buff as well. So in conclusion. This changes overall nerfs argus. Current live argus is great tbh. a small buff instead to like 280% is suffice or just the quality of life like the animation stop i would say instead of basically nerfing him more in terms of dmg cause -75 is A LOT",

    "Every so often I have troubles getting an erection. I’m a 24yo male and shouldn’t have this issue. With my ex it was like a gust of wind could get it up. Now not so much. And as this happens every so often it affects my perspective of my feelings for her. It makes me question if I love her or not or if it’s my body telling me I am not attracted when I don’t actually feel that way. It’s depressing and I am on lexapro and know that can be a factor but am I crazy for thinking this . Is it just a snowball effect because of that? Is this a normal occurrence for people sometimes.

I've known what it's like to be in the darkest place in the world, and I really don't want to go back. Today, I had a lot of fun going out with a friend to watch Godzilla vs Kong and walk around town for a bit. At the end of the day, I came back home and just realized \"Man, everything is so damn awful when we aren't hanging out\". That led to a lot more thinking about how much I'm fucking up my life by failing tons of my classes, how much time I spend sitting here being a worthless person, and how I'm such a burden on everyone. Literally nothing seems fun unless I'm around them, and I think it's sad that, even though I have blood relatives, the only person I consider to be family is him. I guess I don't want to be loved, I want to feel loved. I really hope this is just an episode and not something worse. Sorry for the rant, but hey, I didn't make you read this.",

Couldn’t possibly imagine being prepared for a ton of people trying to play and having your server situation figured out beforehand so you don’t look as incompetent as every other crap gaming company in existence today.

    "Hey y’all, struggling Christian here with a question. When I pray alone I feel like I’m talking to myself. It feels weird because prayer is kind of like a letter to god so it shouldn’t feel like a conversation. But then I started think that all of the good feelings I get come from within me like happiness, joy, or excitement. Those are all internal feeing that can show through my expressions and words but at their core they are from my brain. And I used to think I needed to thank God for those feelings because he was the one that put them there. But now I feel like those good feelings I get are just a reaction based on what’s happening around me and to me. So my questions is: is it possible gods love comes from ourselves rather then from him? And if so why would I need God anymore?",

I also live with my fiancé and so when they interviewed me she asked all about him as well since we live in the same household. I figured we wouldn't receive any benefits because he made okay money then and was not laid off. At the time of the interview I did verbally tell my caseworker that he was not working at that moment only due to complications with covid shut down everything. She still had me send over his last 2 check stubs and then we ended up getting approved. I was shocked but excited. Cut to now.

One thing I’ve learned about is how much I dissociate and how this has been a defense mechanism since was a kid.  She has been gently letting me know that I may have some degree of DID or dissociative identity disorder.  This was pretty scary at first but I’m thinking that she may be on to something.  I don’t have multiple identities on the outside that anyone would notice, but it’s clear that my childhood trauma caused me to have splintered off parts of self that have never been integrated.  Those parts of self are in regular conflict with each other and the result is anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.

I think short sides and longer hair on top is so attractive and I want to look like that but I’m always worried I couldn’t pull it off.

Something along the lines of \"this type of trap has active and dynamic effects, and different aspects of it may have countermeasures\", kind of thing?  Or should I leave it to them to figure out.  I don't want to hand hold too much, but it also kind of sucks to be taking part in a 'mini-game' and not even know its happening.

I have also in recent years educated myself on basic programming so I also have an interest in how the stock market is run by computer. The program/s that run it is no doubt a monster. So, that leads me to a question. What is the likely hood that a stock can be 'throttled' so it doesn't rise as it should? The calculations tweaked so it is less responsive to growth. Assuming the rise of a stock is a linear rise, what if they set it so that it is a non-linear rise, finally topping out at a pre-specified amount? Who runs the software and servers that handle all of this? Is there a company that does it? The government? I've never heard anything on this subject, ever.",

My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

And on the internet I thought I had a chance to feel more comfortable, and act freely to be myself.

I try to be outgoing and social, but when people tell me Im being annoying it makes me feel stupid. And sometimes I tell myself, “be yourself”.

We broke up about 6 years ago. And while she moved on after couple of months Ive not been able to do the same thing even after 6 years. Not a day goes by when I don’t think about her. We haven’t talked since several years and i don’t want to disturb her life now. Every-time I initiate dating someone all i see is her face what would be her reaction on that joke or how would she react. She has a boyfriend now. While I’m still miserable. Trust me Ive tried moving on. Tried online dating. Tried everything. But she just cant go away from my mind. Her memories have become a painful comfort. Why do you think this is happening and what should I do to get over her? Ive tried therapy Ive tried burning mementos. But she is tattooed inside my mind.",
    "Covid is a contagious and deadly virus, no matter what people have read on their shady \"news\" sites or watched in YouTube videos. Actual experts and their advice exist. However, as a therapist, I am expected to validate thoughts and resulting ignorant actions as though it could be truth. I'm tired of it. Adults have a responsibility to educate themselves and recognize propaganda. In this case, the ignorance is killing people. Yet, I have to look them in the eye and pretend to understand their views so that I don't cause THEM more psychological harm as they breathe freely in my space without masks during a deadly pandemic. I don't love shaming people but if anyone should be, it is them. People I know have suffered. Some have died. But I can't, because somehow it is just expected that I'll put my health at risk daily, and not doing so could cost me my job, license, etc. I'm just over it, and over these ignorant folks.",
    "Hi. I want help if anyone can spare a few words of encouragement. I wrote religious on the topic of this because I am kind of a religious. I grew up catholic and I don’t follow the church a lot but I do have faith. I’ve posted her before about how my dad treats me. I’m the oldest daughter and I feel like my mom and I are used as the scapegoat to why everything is horrible for my dad. Anyway, I feel alone a lot. I pray and I feel like no one is listening. Does anyone have some scripture or words of encouragement from the Bible? I sometimes feel like I am the one in the wrong because my dad uses God and my faith against me. Anything would be great. I am going to get a keepsake with the Virgin Mary on it to keep me safe and to remind myself she is there with me. Anyway, thank you to this group. It makes me feel less alone.",
    "I’m a 23 y/o female, 5’2”, and currently weigh 141lbs. I work out 3-4 times a week and am on my feet constantly at work. I’d say I eat an overall healthy diet, cook majority of the time at home, and would describe  myself as moderately active. My concern is over the past year I have gained 10lbs and not changed any of these practices. I’ve been told the weight could be muscles or due to recently returning to school and undergoing stress but I find myself ashamed and unmotivated to continue working out and pushing myself harder. I love weights and cardio but have been finding it hard to motivate myself when I see the number on the scale going up. Am I just psyching myself out or do I need to revisit my overall health routine?",
    "My grandma passed away when I was 8 years old, over 25 years ago. She and my mom were very close; they talked almost every day and were like best friends. After she passed away it was like a light went out in my mom. Every occasion, happy or sad, has had a dark cloud over it because my grandma wasn't there. I miss my grandma too, but it makes me so sad to feel like I will never see my mom truly happy again. She is now the same age that my grandma was when she died, so all the grief is coming out even more. I am the main person she comes to for support and I don't know how to handle it. She calls me crying and says things like, \"I'm just so sad. My life would be so much better if she was still alive.\" I feel like I need to be the \"parent\" and support my mom because she is always so sad all the time.  I was wondering if anyone else was in a similar situation or had any words of advice or wisdom. Thank you.",
    "I had a dream when I was sitting on my couch at night with a girl I didn’t recognize. Although I didn’t recognize her she felt so familiar and it felt like I knew every thing about her. Her brother walked in through the front door and said something that frustrated her. I put my arm around her and then realized that I don’t know her, but she looked at me and put my hand back around her. We fell asleep like that and when I woke up she was gone. I went into my room and there were all these clues left around pointing to seemingly nothing. The only one I can remember is that there was an extra sticker near a power outlet that was a brand which I didn’t use. I recognized this bc I had always used a rival brand. All I can say is that the rest of the dream was me trying to find her and I never did. This last part was very vague.",

    "As a young person and recent defector of the Liberal/Democrat ideology, I have been thinking about the state of our culture and time here in America. Every day I feel myself compelled to stand up and speak in an act of revolution against the status quo. I feel as if God is telling me to follow my heart and speak the truth as an artist against the untruth. But fear is prevalent. Most art, film, music, writing are dominated by ideologically liberal leaning people. Websites where artists gather to advertise their work like YouTube and Facebook are censoring and banning voices that have Conservative values and ideas. How far can I get as an artist down this path? I feel like a bird being forced to crawl on the ground feeling so desperate and hopeless wanting to use the gift and passion my God has given me. In this time when the voice of a conservative is a revolutionary act, are there enough minds out there that would support or be interested in conservative art? I want myself to be economically stable enough to support myself, my future wife, and children. Or should I find another passion?",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

But it doesn’t end there, ladies and gentlemen, I respond with “hitler was a nazi”. He says that anyone who apposes the left is a nazi so that makes him the same as a republican. I said that not everyone who apposes him is a nazi, and he replied with “that’s why we need to imprison everyone who disagrees with the left first because they are the violent ones who want to kill us.” What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People? Better watch out, this guy is gonna run for president and imprison every “nazi” so that it is only pure people with his beliefs.

    "So, I’m currently trying to teach myself astrology. I find that looking at each thing in my chart helps with understanding parts of it. Like for example, my Mars in Libra is what helps me approach things more calmly and my Mercury in Capricorn helps me to formulate my sentences before saying them. But what I have trouble with is putting everything together. I’ve been reading up on aspects and patterns as well, but I just get so confused. It’s like I have the puzzle pieces but I don’t know how to put them together. So I was wondering how everyone here got the hang of reading charts as a whole instead of just their parts?

Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",
    "With such an epic story, you would think someone like Stone would produce an epic film. From the random accents of the characters (specifically, I have no idea what Jolie was trying to do), to some pretty atrocious acting from Farrell-he's capable of much better, but this was at the height of his grandiosity and ego. There are so many moments where it feels like the film is onto something, only to have it stop and spin off into another, pointless direction. Bottom line: a $155 mil film about Alexander the Great should have been iconic, but Alexander falls flat on its face from the weight of the egos involved.",
    "The film is dark humoured, satiric and mocking mirror of society reflecting on human's obsession to fit in certain rules of society, despite how ridiculous they are. We step on our primary feelings and ignore our instincts just to play by the rules, to belong. And even it was the clear theme of being obsessed with being in a couple, I see it as a bigger reflection of society. After the main character runs into the woods, where he finds rebels of coupling, it's clear that they are as extreme as the hotel people. It looks like it's shown that people have to belong to survive, but options are limited and you have to obey, pretend or risk to be destroyed. Various examples of dysfunctional relationships are shown in the film, which looks so familiar – pretending to have something in common, pretending that you understand that you are the same. Desperation, rejection, cruelty in the relationships – we have seen and know it all, but director found the way to remind it with a lighter tone, with the possibility to laugh at ourselves and society. All the characters acted and talked in the same hyper-polite manner – that's what we do, so often we dance around difficult and extreme situations with our repressed feelings. And despite how similar everyone talked, with the same tone and politeness, we can see through that and find individuality of the characters, and it shows that we are more than just rules, etiquette  The obsession to have something in common with you partner reached the peek at the end. It looked like even David and blind women are still in love, but a realisation that in society norms they don't have anything real in common drives to an extreme decision. It shows that we sacrifice so much if we love someone different, and all just to be more acceptable in the society, but at the end society doesn't care, so do we just have to be braver? This film makes more think than feel. The audience who is used to relate to the characters might find it difficult, as even the main character is not very lovable, he is a week and very human in other words. It's not a 'feel good' film but not miserablism, it's smart and innovative reminder",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "I just watched this movie last night for the first time. I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.<br/><br/>The movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.<br/><br/>I feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.<br/><br/>If I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it. It's too late now - I can't get it out of my head. I don't think I've ever been affected this much by a movie.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "First of all, Seven Years In Tibet is a very aesthetically pleasing film. The snowy Himalayas, the Tibetan villages, and the amazing costumes and religious ceremonies are all filmed beautifully, with rich colours and lighting. The music by John Williams is also excellent, and it's fascinating to hear how it blends with the unusual Tibetan music.<br/><br/>It's not all surface though, there's depth here too. Don't believe the negative comments about Brad Pitt's acting. Admittedly his accent slips a bit in places, but he does a great job as Heinrich, both the unpleasant, arrogant character at the beginning, and the more gentle and wise man that he becomes as the film progresses. His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental. The film is well edited; scenes are not drawn out any longer than they need to be. As a whole, it is fast paced but also peaceful, tender and moving. You don't get bored but you're not bombarded with pointless action scenes either.<br/><br/>It's a pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood film where women and other cultures aren't treated as objects, and are allowed to be full, complex characters. It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.<br/><br/>Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended.",
    "Ice age 3 was really funny and it stays true to the series. Same old characters, a whole new adventure that everyone at any age can enjoy.<br/><br/>I saw the critics and I thought to my self that it would be good, but I didn't expect much, but I really did enjoy it more than I thought. It may not be the best compared to the other Ice Age films, but it still a great thrill ride that the audience can enjoy.<br/><br/>And if you find a theater near you that has it in digital 3D, go and watch it in 3D, because the action and adventure will excite you even more than it actually does.<br/><br/>Normally people think since it's a third part, then the movie won't be that great, but hear me when I say that keep that thought out of your mind and parents, take your kids with you, they are sure to leave with a smile and a long lasting excitement for more.<br/><br/>100% enjoyable, its a 10!",
    "I love this movie! It was so adorable, so charming & the writing was absolutely terrific! I love the animation & the characters (including the minions) were all fantastic! A MUST WATCH!",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. <br/><br/>The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! <br/><br/>For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it. Go see this.",
    "I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.<br/><br/>Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "I am written this review In Memorie of my all time favorite the best horror director Wes Craven that sadly is no longer with us anymore. On August 30th 2015, Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him. <br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. <br/><br/>The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death, I love it!!! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my number 1 favorite film in the franchise it stays in my heart forever. I am a big fan of this film I even have a poster hang on door in my room, my girlfriend give it to me as gift. I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare, Scream, Shocker,The People Under the Stairs, Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross $26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream , New Nightmare, Shocker and The People Under the Stairs. <br/><br/>The first film is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams, a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers, can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams, you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger, she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams, but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever, smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put booby-traps for Freddy? Awesome!<br/><br/>Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss, is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. <br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. <br/><br/>Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films. <br/><br/>John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson, Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome, I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. <br/><br/>I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is the best classic slasher film,one of the best horror movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. My number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film, it is fast paced, entertaining, not boring or over long film, but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
    "Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as \"Sergeant Major Dickerson\",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.",
    "We all remember being a teenager.  A crazy, intense time when your high were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant.<br/><br/>John Hughes movie brilliantly captures that environment, that era in our lives, and all the social rifts that we all helped to create for ourselves. I have heard it said that \"The Breakfast Club\" is melodramatic, overacted, and simplistic.  If you subscribe to that flippant perspective you might as well join Vernon in his office because you are doing the same thing that he did.  Seeing the movie as you want to see it, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.<br/><br/>If you really want to understand this film, think back to your own high school days.  Think about your last year there.  Dig out your old diary or book of angstful poems and reaquaint yourself with who you were then, when you felt things more deeply.  \"The Breakfast Club\" does not exist not for highschool kids, as some suggest.  Why would they need it?  They live there. It exists for all of us who have already been through there, who feel that they are above it now.  It exists so that we can remember what it was like and better understand ourselves, and the next generation.  Because you can't dismiss something you understand.",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br/><br/>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br/><br/>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br/><br/>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br/><br/>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br/><br/>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br/><br/>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are great again<br/><br/>Charm returns<br/><br/>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Only one movie with Baby Groot?

    "I have only ever seen this film once, I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence.  I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment.",
    "As most are undoubtedly aware this is the film that the director virtually expunged from his repertoire. But why did Stanley Kubrick really disown SPARTACUS (1960)? The answer can be summed up in two words: absolute control. Kubrick wanted total administrative as well as artistic authority over the making of the film about a revolt of gladiators and slaves in ancient Rome.<br/><br/>But you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY (1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well. Only three weeks into what would prove to be an incredibly complex and arduous production, Douglas fired venerable director Anthony Mann (RAW DEAL, RAILROADED,THE FURIES, THE NAKED SPUR, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, MAN OF THE WEST, etc.) from SPARTACUS. With only two days notice, Kubrick was hired to replace him.<br/><br/>Shooting PATHS OF GLORY, Douglas had confined his criticisms and objections to Kubrick's failed rewriting of the script (they went with the original screenplay). Douglas' complaints and artistic influence were far greater on SPARTACUS, much to Kubrick's chagrin. Though the director craved autonomy over every aspect of the film, Douglas would not budge. A tense compromise was reached but ultimately Douglas had the last word. Kubrick saw himself as just a hired gun. And he would never allow himself to be placed in this position again.<br/><br/>Later, both men would complain about the film's outcome and each other. They never made another movie together. <br/><br/>But SPARTACUS is no uneven patchwork of divergent ideas. The film is cohesive and arresting. At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.",
    "I think this film is wonderful. It is sheer entertainment for kids and hilarious for adults.<br/><br/>I first watched this movie age 7, and i loved it...now i watch it again age 14 and I'm howling with laughter. The 'You wanna buy a sundial?' sequence renders me unable to breathe for laughter, whilst when i was younger it got not so much as a giggle.<br/><br/>As with all Disney films, the jokes are for the 'big kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!<br/><br/>Overall - 8/10",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.<br/><br/>And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.<br/><br/>Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.<br/><br/>The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.<br/><br/>O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",
    "This film was exceptional and one of the best I've seen this year. Watiti has great comedic vision and the cast is phenomenal. Jojo Rabbit was wierd , funny , heartwarming and heartbreaking and I think its definitely worth the watch.",
    "I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no \"Finding Nemo\" or \"Toy Story.\" But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!<br/><br/>In my opinion, Cars 1 was a little slow. It dragged a little too long in certain parts. Cars 2 suffers from no such thing.<br/><br/>To sum it up; Cars 2 may not be Toy Story but it sure is FUN and ENTERTAINING.",
    "I am truly sadden that this film got bashed so much. I hear reviews saying this film \"sucks\" or it has too many inaccuracies. Movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List have also \"some\" inaccuracies in them. (They are Masterpieces) It is pretty sad this film has been getting this bashed. It doesn't deserve to be.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is full of suspense and is directed beautifully by Kathryn Bigelow. I'd have to say this is movie truly captures the Iraq War. What a dangerous war it was for our soldiers. This movie shows us what our soldiers went through. This isn't bashing the American soldiers at all or even War. It gives us a great deal of appreciation for our troops who are risking their lives every single day for Us, Freedom and the U.S.A.<br/><br/>The true purpose of this movie is to not just praise the soldiers. But for one of the military's unrecognized heroes which are the technicians of the bombs squads who risk their lives to save others. This is the purpose of the movie to let everyone know what these people do.<br/><br/>This time and I know all of you out there, don't want to hear it, the critics are actually right. This movie is fantastically directed by Kathryn Bigelow and she rightfully deserved her Oscar for best director.<br/><br/>I know many Avatar fans out there probably rated this movie a 1, without even seeing it because it won Best Picture and Avatar didn't. This movie seems its suffering from the curse of Best Picture. More people have watched Avatar than the Hurt Locker. So of course this film has gotten bashed by so many. I think SOME of the bad reviews are the Avatar Fanboys who are just angry Avatar didn't win Best Picture.<br/><br/>Please don't just go along with the bad reviews this film has gotten from IMDb. Just try and watch this film.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a war epic, that I hope it becomes appreciative as time passes. 9/10 Highly recommended.",
    "It's funny, but I notice most of the prior comments are from guys, but speaking as a woman, this is by no means just a guy's flick. It's been one of my favorite films since the day it came out. It's got everything- drama, romance, action, and an honest to goodness story. There are even interesting themes, like the moral dilemma that Wyatt finds himself in-- Is he compelled to help fight the Cowboys even though he's \"retired\" and just wants to live out his life in peace? Is there a moral equivalence between killing for justice and killing for retribution? How far can a man go to sacrifice his own integrity and better judgment? Even though the Earps are the \"good guys\", the movie doesn't glamorize violence. Doc Holliday and some of the Earps' other sidekicks (\"Creek Johnson\" and \"Texas Jack\") are obviously pretty shady characters, but at the end of the day, are forced to choose between right and wrong, and they choose correctly. It doesn't get much better than Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and I can't for the life of me understand why he didn't get nominated for it. I also appreciate the fact that the love story between Wyatt and Josephine didn't dominate the film and take away from the real plot, ala \"Titanic\". The love story simply served its purpose in helping viewers to better understand the character of Wyatt. Also the friendship between Wyatt and Doc was portrayed tenderly but not wussily. And okay, as a woman, let me just say that there is no one sexier than Sam Elliot. Man alive, if there ever was a person born to portray a cowboy, that guy is IT. If you've never seen a Western, or are not a fan, try this movie. It will make a believer out of you.",

    "SAW III in my opinion is tied with the original as the best in the series. For many reasons- one reason being that it keeps it simple. Instead of dealing with multiple characters that sacrificed any kind of character development like in SAW's II, IV, and V, SAW III, like the original, has much fewer characters, leading to a more intimate setting where we can connect to everyone. And while it does have sub-plots, they don't feel out of place, they're not just randomly thrown in to shock audiences. They feel organic, they all connect smoothly at the end and make sense as to why.<br/><br/>If you've seen a SAW film, you know the story is going to have twists, turns, and violence/gore to accompany them. But at least SAW III does it very well. It expands on characterization and back stories for these characters and ties up the loose ends as believably as this franchise can do. We also get a deeper look at the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, knowing more about how the two really look at each other. Jigsaw is the calm, cancer-stricken anti-hero who does these evil things to prove a moral standpoint. Amanda, on the other hand, doesn't seem to grasp this - instead using the traps to torture her victims as a way to get back at innocent people for the way she was tortured herself with suicidal tendencies and drug abuse. With these two extremes, we see how much Jigsaw is trying to mentor her in his vision while she struggles with her own demons. And when Jigsaw gets ill, we see that Amanda really isn't a fitting apprentice to carry on his legacy as her vindictiveness comes out.<br/><br/>SAW III is also supported by the fact that the two protagonists are developed deeply. Maybe not as much as our two anti-heros, but we understand where they're coming from. From Lynn's dour nature to devastated Jeff's situation. The subplot with Jeff by the way adds some great underlying messages to the film. These messages shows us that hate, vengeance, revenge, and complacency brings more pain than anything else, and does not solve anything. It ruins families, destroys relationships, clouds judgment, and at the end: self-destruction. Leigh Whannell, who wrote the first two films with James Waan and flew solo writing the screenplay for this one, does a nice job giving the spotlight to all the characters instead of just focusing on Jigsaw and Amanda. He makes SAW III more of a character study than any of the other installments and that's one of the essential reasons why this installment scores high.<br/><br/>Darren Lynn Bousman directs a much more subtle film than he did with SAW II and SAW IV. The quick edits are kept to a bare minimum (thank God) and the film has a lot of dread going for it. Very moody and darkly atmospheric. He focuses on the drama and emotion at hand, which was a vast improvement on SAW II and especially SAW IV. He lets the acting and the situations do the work for him instead of being extra-fancy with the camera work. Lastly, the cinematography is a plus. Darren shoots the film with a vibrant and kinetic feel and uses good, non-queasy camera movements. I love the lighting most of all though; he uses a wide arrange in the color palette (from lime green to icy blue). He definitely proves here that he knows how to grasp the material and visualize it. His direction of III ranks alongside James Waan's mindblowing direction of the original.<br/><br/>The acting is hardly an issue. It's usually good or better. Tobin Bell can play John Kramer in his sleep by now for gods sake! He shows excellent range and is always effective in the role because he gives the character more depth than what the script probably provides. Shawnee Smith is superb as Amanda, who will always be one of my favorite characters in the series. This is without a single doubt her shining moment, her most dramatic portion in the series. You really want to hate her but you just can't because you pity her. Smith could have easily played the character as an annoying nutjob, but she gives the character substance and unbelievable humanality. Angus Macfadyen as Jeff is superb in his role as well; he makes Jeff the most realistic and sympathetic character within the entire series. As far as I'm concerned, McFayden nailed the mourning father act. Bahar Soomekh was decent but always outshone by Bell, Smith, and McFayden. Her acting was a bit flimsy at times, but for the most part she gave a nice performance and made her character likable.<br/><br/>The suspense and tension, while not as impressive as the original, is still great. Hardly any other Saw film or horror film in general for that matter (with the exception of Eden Lake from last year and Inside from 2007) has been so edge-of-your-seat gripping, so exciting. The slow pacing allows you to gradually absorb everything in, and this makes it all the more better.<br/><br/>There is a lot of extreme gore in this film, but unlike some other installments like Saws IV and V, it's done very well and serves a purpose. Jeff's bloody trials are in a lot of ways cathartic. You're enduring these horrific scenes along with Jeff, and the relief at the end that the horror is over really fits with the theme of redemption through forgiveness. Moreover, the revelation that the horror isn't over, and what you feel as a result, drives home the Shakespearean tragedy in a very personal way because you the audience have to keep enduring it.<br/><br/>SAW III is clever, solidly written, has the best characters, succeeds with the emotional aspect it was going for, and ties up loose ends perfectly. For a third installment in a horror series, it's incredibly strong.",
    "And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive \"Spider-Man\" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.",

Sure she could be scared (of being revealed to be a fraud by the true her) but not of a shadow. Again, purposeful misleading to set up the twist.<br/><br/>3. Why does the good version go insane and deciude the only way to get revenge on her evil self is to raise an army of evil duplicates that murder their good halves? Again, contrived and makes no sense.<br/><br/>4. Why didn't/ couldn't the good version of the girl use the escalators to escape the evil realm? This really doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>5. How the hell did all of the evil versions have enough food/ water to survive?<br/><br/>6. Surely not every single copy of everyone in the world was stored in the one bunker shown. So how did the \"Good\" girl convince all of the evil copies (of all the rest of the world) to arise??<br/><br/>There are probably many many MANY more issues with this film. But god does it destroy itself trying way too hard to set up a profound twist that is just completely illogical.",
    "Don't believe the negative reviews on this one. Its easily the most underrated movie I have come across, and can best be described as a hidden gem for the ones who like historical adventure/action-movies (Braveheart/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/Robin Hood) and fantasy-movies. <br/><br/>Others have described it better here on IMDb, so I am just going to say this: It is not a historical correct piece, and do not try to be. It should be viewed as a fantasy, even though the vikings portrayed and their buildings/settlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.<br/><br/>Btw: To all you who like the above-mentioned movies for the big battle-scenes and sword-fighting, don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area (even though it got them). On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in pre-medieval times. Instead of having the one super-hero defying all logic, you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie, with Banderas, Storhøi and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.<br/><br/>This is a great adventure of a movie, which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.<br/><br/>9/10 - Must see for all who like adventure/fantasy",
    "Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head. You can't help but incredulously laugh at what happens. This is all about oddballs.<br/><br/>The good. Excellent acting. Totally off the wall characters, actions and situations, yet completely logical. Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.<br/><br/>The actors. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovich play disturbingly crazy roles stuffed with delusion and heavily dosed with stupidity. While Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons seem almost out of place as the standard bearers of reason.<br/><br/>The bad. Since it's so bizarre, it won't please everyone.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. Offbeat and cooky comedy. Don't think you'll see your run of the mill kind of film and you'll have fun.",
    "I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on \"the list\" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like \"Superbad\", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of \"40 Year Old Virgin\", \"Superbad\", or \"Knocked Up\".<br/><br/>For starters, there was a definite presence of the \"TV actors on the big screen\" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of \"That 70s Show\" didn't follow her to \"Forgetting\"'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that \"Forgetting\" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than \"American Psycho 2\" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.<br/><br/>The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.<br/><br/>The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on \"CSI\") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious \"American Psycho 2\"); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with \"Superbad\"). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt \"Knocked Up\"). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write \"Fun with Dick and Jane\".<br/><br/>All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'. <br/><br/>The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events. <br/><br/>In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.<br/><br/>One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.<br/><br/>Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games). <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work. <br/><br/>These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.<br/><br/>Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.<br/><br/>What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children. <br/><br/>Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain.",
    "In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:<br/><br/>First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: \nIs Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?<br/><br/>Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.<br/><br/>During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",
    "I was talked into seeing this, and I have to shout it out, because it is a RIOT! I don't write many reviews, but when I love a film, I have to. If I have any complaint on this one, it's the title. I expected gross-out humor (\"crude\"). There isn't any, really. It's actually extremely unpredictable, subtle and extremely smart humor.<br/><br/>It has a story arc that you begin to somewhat anticipate, but you don't feel you're being patronized. Instead, you're left feeling that very intelligent people put this thing together in hopes that everyone would find something to love about it.<br/><br/>The cast is great, the animation is fun, and it's non-dizzying 3-D.<br/><br/>When I saw it, the entire audience clapped at the end, because we were entertained throughout, and found the ending really satisfying.<br/><br/>What else? Sweet emotions crop up because we can all relate to the family dynamics. Every family has the screw-up, the salt of the earth, the rebel, and the stubborn one. And it has one of the funniest babies ever put on film. A baby unlike any baby you'll ever see anywhere.<br/><br/>Very, very funny. Definitely recommend.",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.<br/><br/>Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to \"Christmas Town\". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.<br/><br/>People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! <br/><br/>10/10",
    "\"Atonement\" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. <br/><br/>Act I begins like an upper-class comedy of manners. The setting is the Tallis family's stately home, on a hot summer's day in 1935. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old with ambitions to be a writer, has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins, but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them. Robbie has fallen in love with Cecilia and accidentally sends her a sexually explicit love-letter. In other circumstances this might have resulted in disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one. The tone of the film changes abruptly, however, when Briony's cousin Lola is sexually assaulted. Lola cannot identify her assailant, but Briony, who was a witness, falsely accuses Robbie. As a result, he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison. <br/><br/>In Act II, set in 1940, Robbie, released from jail, is now a soldier with the British Army in France. He is desperately trying to reach Dunkirk ahead of the advancing Germans, kept going not by fighting spirit or patriotism, but by the hope of returning to Cecilia, who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment, becoming estranged from her family as a result. In Act III we see Briony, now eighteen, as a volunteer nurse in a London hospital. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help him clear his name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apart.<br/><br/>After \"The Last King of Scotland\" and \"Becoming Jane\", James McEvoy is the rising male star of the British cinema, and his performance here is the best yet that I have seen. Whereas Dr Garrigan in \"The Last King\" was morally flawed, and Lefroy in \"Becoming Jane\" hid his better nature beneath a roguish exterior, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy succeeds in conveying his character's basic decency, achieving the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is another rising British star, and this is her second film with director Joe Wright after \"Pride and Prejudice\". Although she was good in the comedy \"Bend it like Beckham\", I think that her films with Wright are her best, suggesting that her future lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" in which she seemed miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the loveliest, but also the liveliest and most spirited heroine of any film I have seen recently. Special mentions must also go to Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and to Vanessa Redgrave who plays the now-elderly Briony in the epilogue, set in 1999. I felt, however, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. <br/><br/>This was only Wright's second feature film, and he has already established himself as an accomplished director. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a good film, but \"Atonement\" is better. Ian McEwan's book is among the best novels of recent years, and I doubt if any cinematic treatment could capture all its nuances. One of its themes in particular, the debate between literary traditionalism and modernism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wright and the scriptwriter Christopher Hampton wisely steer clear of it. Hampton, who has turned the book into a very good screenplay, keeps McEwan's final twist, although it is here presented in a different way, with Briony revealing the truth in an TV interview. <br/><br/>If, however, the film does not capture all the literary nuances of the novel, Wright makes up for this with his extraordinary visual imagination, something sometimes lacking in films based upon novels. \"Atonement\" joins that list of films (\"Far from Heaven\" and \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" are other examples that come to mind) where almost every scene seems composed like a painting. This is true not only of Act I, set in that beautiful stately home (actually Stokesay Court in Shropshire), but also of Act II, where Wright can find a terrible beauty even in war, especially in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot of the Dunkirk beaches in the grey morning light. Particularly moving was the scene where the British soldiers sing \"Dear Lord and Father of Mankind\". The second line of John Greenleaf Whittier's hymn is, of course, \"Forgive Our Foolish Ways\"- a particularly apt comment on war, and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the characters.<br/><br/>Also very good was Dario Marianelli's musical score, which (appropriately for a film in which writing plays an important part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping. Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that its British origins and late summer (traditionally blockbuster season) release date will not prejudice the Academy against it when it comes to next year's Oscars. 9/10",

    "Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised \" Esther's secret\" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the \"secret\" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a \"creepy\" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",
    "I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.<br/><br/>At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.<br/><br/>There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.",

    "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \"Scarface\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \"American Dream\".<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about the \"cheesiness\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.<br/><br/>This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.<br/><br/>The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.<br/><br/>Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \"Scarface\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original \"Willy Wonka\" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",

    "Mass amateurization refers to the capabilities that new forms of media have given to non-professionals and the ways in which those non-professionals have applied those capabilities to solve problems (e.g. create and distribute content) that compete with the solutions offered by larger, professional institutions. Mass amateurization is most often associated with Web 2.0 technologies. These technologies include the rise of blogs and citizen journalism, photo and video-sharing services such as Flickr and YouTube, user-generated wikis like Wikipedia, and distributed accommodation services such as Airbnb. While the social web is not the only technology responsible for the rise of mass amateurization, Clay Shirky claims Web 2.0 has allowed amateurs to undertake increasingly complex tasks resulting in accomplishments that would seem daunting within the traditional institutional model. In addition to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed a variety of digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, trackbacks, and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during the first decade of the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media. Mass amateurization is a social, cumulative and collaborative activity, wherein ideas will flow back up the pipeline from consumers and they will share them among themselves.",

    "Bass–Serre theory is a part of the mathematical subject of group theory that deals with analyzing the algebraic structure of groups acting by automorphisms on simplicial trees. The theory relates group actions on trees with decomposing groups as iterated applications of the operations of free product with amalgamation and HNN extension, via the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. Bass–Serre theory can be regarded as one-dimensional version of the orbifold theory. History\nBass–Serre theory was developed by Jean-Pierre Serre in the 1970s and formalized in Trees, Serre's 1977 monograph (developed in collaboration with Hyman Bass) on the subject. Serre's original motivation was to understand the structure of certain algebraic groups whose Bruhat–Tits buildings are trees. However, the theory quickly became a standard tool of geometric group theory and geometric topology, particularly the study of 3-manifolds. Subsequent work of Bass contributed substantially to the formalization and development of basic tools of the theory and currently the term \"Bass–Serre theory\" is widely used to describe the subject.",
    "Hemoglobin Barts, abbreviated Hb Barts, is an abnormal type of hemoglobin that consists of four gamma globins. It is moderately insoluble, and therefore accumulates in the red blood cells. Hb Barts has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, so it cannot release oxygen to the tissue. Therefore, this makes it an inefficient oxygen carrier. As an embryo develops, it begins to produce alpha-globins at weeks 5–6 of development. When both of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes which code for alpha globins becomes dysfunctional, the affected fetuses will have difficulty in synthesizing a functional hemoglobin. As a result, gamma chains will accumulate and form four gamma globins. These gamma globins bind to form hemoglobin Barts. It is produced in the disease alpha-thalassemia and in the most severe of cases, it is the only form of hemoglobin in circulation. In this situation, a fetus will develop hydrops fetalis and normally die before or shortly after birth, unless intrauterine blood transfusion is performed. Since hemoglobin Barts is elevated in alpha thalassemia, it can be measured, providing a useful screening test for this disease in some populations.",

    "High Angle Control System (HACS) was a British anti-aircraft fire-control system employed by the Royal Navy from 1931 onwards and used widely during World War II. HACS calculated the necessary deflection required to place an explosive shell in the location of a target flying at a known height, bearing and speed. Early history\nThe HACS was first proposed in the 1920s and began to appear on Royal Navy (RN) ships in January 1930, when HACS I went to sea in . HACS I did not have any stabilization or power assist for director training. HACS III which appeared in 1935, had provision for stabilization, was hydraulically driven, featured much improved data transmission and it introduced the HACS III Table. The HACS III table (computer) had numerous improvements including raising maximum target speed to 350 knots, continuous automatic fuze prediction, improved geometry in the deflection Screen, and provisions for gyro inputs to provide stabilization of data received from the director. The HACS was a control system and was made possible by an effective data transmission network between an external gun director, a below decks fire control computer, and the ship's medium calibre anti-aircraft (AA) guns.",

Typically, the different types of asset-based loans include accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, equipment financing, or real estate financing Asset-based lending in this more specific sense is possible only in certain countries whose legal systems allow borrowers to pledge such assets to lenders as collateral for loans (through the creation of enforceable security interests). Usage\nAsset-based lending is usually done when the normal routes of raising funds is not possible, such as the capital markets (selling bonds to investors) and normal unsecured or mortgage secured bank. This is often because the company has exhausted other capital raising options or needs more immediate capital for project financing needs (such as inventory purchases, mergers, acquisitions, and debt purchasing). Asset-based loans are also usually accompanied by lower interest rates, as in the event of a default the lender can recoup its investment by seizing and liquidating the assets tied to the loan.",

The simplest, or most evasive, approach is RAM-scraping, accessing the system's memory and exporting the copied information via a remote access trojan (RAT) as this minimizes any software or hardware tampering, potentially leaving no footprints. POS attacks may also include the use of various bits of hardware: dongles, trojan card readers, (wireless) data transmitters and receivers. Being at the gateway of transactions, POS malware enables hackers to process and steal thousands, even millions, of transaction payment data, depending upon the target, the number of devices affected, and how long the attack goes undetected. This is done before or outside of the card information being (usually) encrypted and sent to the payment processor for authorization. List of POS RAM scraper malware variants",

    "Michael van Gerwen (; born 25 April 1989) is a Dutch professional darts player. He is currently ranked number three in the world, having been world number one from 2014 to 2021. He is also a three-time PDC World Champion, having won the title in 2014, 2017 and 2019.  Van Gerwen began playing darts at the age of 13. He won the 2006 World Masters and threw a televised nine-dart finish at the 2007 Masters of Darts, becoming the youngest player to do both, aged 17. However, after this initial burst onto the darting scene, van Gerwen struggled for consistent form until his breakthrough year in 2012. Improving from world number 38 at the start of 2012 to number four at the beginning of 2013, he won his first major PDC title at the World Grand Prix and reached the final at the 2013 World Championship. In 2014, at the age of 24, van Gerwen became the youngest winner of the PDC World Championship, a record he still holds today, as well as being one of only five players to win it more than once. He also holds the record for the highest three-dart average in a televised darts match, with 123.4.",
    "Chakán (, ‘1) oregano of this land; 2) macaw tail feathers.’) is the name of one of the Mayan jurisdictions (kuchkabalob) that existed on the Yucatan Peninsula at the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the sixteenth century. Unlike other jurisdictions, Chakán did not seem to have a centralized government or control of a dominant Halach Uinik, as in the case of the provinces Ceh Pech or Ah Kin Chel. This is inferred from the fact that upon the Spaniards' arrival, Francisco de Montejo (el Mozo) was well received by some local leaders (batabob), but not others, such as Ah Kin Chuy, who organized resistance in the region's eastern towns to repel Spanish settlers. The most important city in the jurisdiction may have been Caucel, which controlled the region's salt trade since this material came from Chuburná and Sisal. Caucel's batab, named Ah Kin Euán, was so open to the Spanish from the outset of the conquest that he converted to Catholicism and changed his name to Francisco Euán, maintaining his position as batab for much longer.",

    "European exploration and settlement of Oceania began in the 16th century, starting with Portuguese settling the Moluccas and Spanish (Castilian) landings and shipwrecks in the Marianas Islands, east of the Philippines, followed by the Portuguese landing and settling  temporarily (due to the monsoons) in the Tanimbar or the Aru Islands and in some of the Caroline Islands and Papua New Guinea, and several Spanish landings in the Caroline Islands and New Guinea. Subsequent rivalry between European colonial powers, trade opportunities and Christian missions drove further European exploration and eventual settlement. After the 17th century Dutch landings in New Zealand and Australia, but not settling these lands, the British became the dominant colonial power in the region, establishing settler colonies in what would become Australia and New Zealand, both of which now have majority European-descended populations. States including New Caledonia (Caldoche), Hawaii, French Polynesia and Norfolk Island also have considerable European populations. Europeans remain a primary ethnic group in much of Oceania, both numerically and economically. European settlement and colonization"

    " Recent results on data-efficient machine learning have shone a spotlight on the “data starvation” problem facing many important machine learning applications such as biodiversity monitoring, medical imaging, and fraud detection — there are not enough labeled examples to train a meaningful model. In this paper, we explore the problem of creating labeled datasets using generative models. We propose DatasetGAN, a methodology that uses a generative model to create a dataset of synthetic data instances and uses a discriminative model to distinguish the synthetic data instances from real data instances. The generative model is trained based on feedback from a user regarding the realism of the synthetic data instances, whereas the discriminative model is trained to classify instances as either real or synthetic. We show that, used iteratively, this methodology can create high-quality labeled datasets with as little as 10% of the labeled data usually required. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on a variety of datasets including figure drawings, wildlife images, and satellite images of electrical power lines and show that our approach reduces the amount of labeled data needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST benchmark by a factor of 20, and state-of-the-art performance on the EMNIST benchmark by a factor of 10.",
    " Many state-of-the-art segmentation models exploit domain-specific information for better performance but rely on either 1) assuming the availability of domain-specific segmentation models or 2) using heuristic normalization schemes that do not perform well when the distribution of the data is complex. In this paper, we aim to address both of these issues. We propose a realistic image normalization (RIN) approach towards learning a single segmentation model that is able to adapt to multiple domains while maintaining performance. Our approach first estimates the domain-specificity in the image and then compensates for it by adjusting the image pixel-wise so that the distribution becomes more uniform. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three publicly available datasets, and show the advantages against prior art on both segmented and unsegmented images.",
    " An image segmentation method is proposed in this paper, which is based on a combined approach of fuzzy classification and contextual region growing. First, to obtain the initial segments, the image is partitioned into several regions by using a fuzzy classification method. In order to obtain appropriate parameters for the fuzzy classification, we propose to select the appropriate fuzzy rules by using a genetic algorithm. Then, in order to obtain the final segments, the regions obtained by the fuzzy classification are merged into larger segments by using a contextual region growing method, where the merging is based on the similarity between the regions and the gradient of the image. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the database of UTK-IMDB is used, which is a standard database for benchmarking image segmentation methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in segmenting medical images.",
    " We present a cross-modal self-attention network (CMSAN) for referring image segmentation. Given a referring expression, our goal is to assign segment labels to each pixel in the corresponding image region. To this end, we propose to use a self-attention mechanism to capture the relationships between referring expressions and image regions, as well as the relationships between the image regions themselves. Specifically, we generate region queries and phrase queries to represent the image regions and referring expressions, respectively. Then, we apply self-attention to compute the weights of the region queries and phrase queries, which indicate the relevance between each region and each phrase. Finally, we use the weighted region queries and phrase queries to predict the segment labels for the image regions. To handle the long-tail problem in referring expressions, we propose to use a progressive attention mechanism, which gradually attends to the long-tail phrases. In addition, to overcome the data imbalance between referring expressions and image regions, we introduce a cross-modal sampling strategy to balance the training samples. Our experimental results on the ReferItSeg dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",
    " Semantic image segmentation, as a fundamental task in computer vision, aims at assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image. Recently, deep learning methods have shown promising results in this area. However, most existing methods rely on greedy inference, which can result in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic image segmentation based on Deep Gaussian CRFs (DGCRFs), which are a class of probabilistic models that leverage deep features learned by convolutional neural networks. By formulating the segmentation problem as a probabilistic inference problem, our approach is able to produce more accurate and robust predictions. We introduce a fast and exact inference algorithm that scales to realistic images. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale inference scheme that further improves the segmentation quality by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the DGCRFs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark, significantly improving the popular Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder architecture.",

    " Recent works in contrastive learning based on triplet networks achieve remarkable performance in image semantic segmentation.

    " We introduce a new computational paradigm for belief propagation. This new paradigm, which we call Sigma Point Belief Propagation (SPBP), is based on the Monte Carlo approximation of the partition function, analogously to the way in which the quantum partition function is replaced by its classical Monte Carlo analog in Quantum Monte Carlo methods. In SPBP, particles propagate through the graph, summing the log-likelihoods of the variable nodes they visit. The particles also carry a weight which is proportional to the number of visits, and decay over time. These properties enable SPBP to compute the belief propagation iterates in a distributed manner, where particles are propagated through the graph by the variable nodes, and the factor nodes merely weigh and sum the particles. In experiments on synthetic datasets, we show that SPBP can yield an order of magnitude speedup over standard belief propagation, with a relatively small increase in the error.",
    " Recent progress in sketch colorization is primarily focused on accurate color prediction and lacks consideration of semantic segmentation. We propose a new loss function for sketch colorization that combines adversarial loss with segmentation loss, which can improve the colorization results and maintain the localization of the color. The segmentation loss is proposed to enforce the correspondence between the predicted color and the labeled segment map by introducing a threshold on the gradient of the segmentation metric. In addition, we introduce a new loss function for sketch colorization, termed as the adversarial segmentation loss, which combines adversarial loss with the proposed segmentation loss. The adversarial loss can enhance the colorization results by encouraging the predicted color to be more realistic, while the segmentation loss can improve the localization of the color. The proposed method has been evaluated on the public sketch-colorization dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.",
    " We study the Cauchy problem for elliptic complexes in the space of distributions. We show that the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy problem imply the completeness of the corresponding initial data. This result is applied to the Cauchy problem for elliptic complexes associated to a complex Monge-Ampere equation in the space of distributions.\n\n## Implicit function theorem and the Cauchy problem for elliptic complexes \n\nLet $\\mathcal{E}$ be a complex of elliptic operators on a smooth manifold $X$. The Cauchy problem for $\\mathcal{E}$ consists in finding a function $u\\in C^\\infty(X)$ such that $u\\restriction_{\\partial X} =f$ and $\\mathcal{E}(u) = 0$ on $X$, where $f$ is a given data on $\\partial X$. If $\\mathcal{E}$ is a complex of pseudodifferential operators, the Cauchy problem has been widely studied using various approaches (see [^1] for instance). In all these cases, the methods rely on the possibility of defining the involved operators as distributions, that is, as linear maps from the space of smooth functions to the space of smooth functions equipped with the $C^\\infty$-topology. However, it is well known that the definition of the involved operators in the distribution space does not always yield a meaningful definition for the elliptic complex $\\mathcal{E}$. Indeed, in general, there is no reason why the differential operator $\\mathcal{E}$ should be continuous as a map from the space of smooth functions to the space of distributions. Therefore, one cannot expect to apply classical methods to solve the Cauchy problem for $\\mathcal{E}$ in the space of distributions.\n\n## An explicit regularizing property and the completeness of initial data \n\nIn this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for an elliptic complex $\\mathcal{E}$ in the distribution space. We show that the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy problem imply the completeness of the corresponding initial data $f$, provided that $f$ is in the range of $\\mathcal{E}$. To prove this result, we use an explicit regularizing property of the elliptic complex $\\mathcal{E}$, which enables us to define a map from the space of smooth functions to itself, that is,",
    " Deep learning segmentation networks for rectal cancer microscopy images often show strong model variance, which hampers generalization performance. We attribute this to the limited amount of training data available, which leads to overfitting. To mitigate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective approach to reduce the model variance of a segmentation network. Our approach consists of training the network with data augmentation on a larger dataset, and then fine-tuning the network on the target dataset with a lower amount of labeled data. We compare our method to other approaches for model variance reduction, such as training on a larger dataset without data augmentation, and model selection using validation performance. Our results show that our method improves the mean Dice similarity coefficient by 5.2% compared to training on the full dataset without data augmentation, and by 3.2% compared to model selection using validation performance. Furthermore, it reduces the maximum Dice coefficient variation among five different runs by 40.7%.",
    " We present a new architecture for robust semantic segmentation based on superpixels derived from a clustering of pixels. Superpixels provide an initial grouping of pixels that captures local structure, such that each superpixel can be treated as a single object. We propose a novel approach to incorporate this prior knowledge of object locations by learning a superpixel convolutional network (SCN) that directly operates on superpixel inputs. Our approach leverages the recently introduced Inception architecture for efficient computation of multi-scale information. We show that Inception features extracted from superpixels provide good performance on semantic segmentation, and we analyze types of information that are missed when going from pixels to superpixels. We then propose a modification of the classical bilateral filter that is applied to the raw pixel data prior to running our SCN. This modification adaptively enhances the information content of each pixel, providing a form of pixel-level attention. We show that this attention mechanism improves performance in semantic segmentation, probably by making our SCN more robust to the loss of information during the superpixel clustering step. Our approach achieves 75.8% mean accuracy on the CamVid dataset, a new record on this dataset, and 79.4% mean accuracy on the Stanford Background dataset.",

By avoiding manual labor and multiple choices during the pipeline, the presented dataset provides an objective ground truth, which we use to evaluate dozens of state-of-the-art deep learning models. We find that the best models still fail at detecting synapses in EM images, but with a significant improvement over previous works. Furthermore, we show the possibility of creating new effective models using only a small number of training examples. Finally, we use the winning models to provide a quantitative characterization, for the first time, of the full heterogeneity of synapses in a large brain region, thereby paving the way to a full understanding of the complexity of brain connectivity.",
    " Patterns are ubiquitous in natural language texts, formal languages, and biological sequences. Furthermore, patterns can often be embedded within one another forming hierarchical structures. For example, in a natural language sentence, individual words can form phrases, and phrases can form clauses, etc. Similarly, in genetic sequences, motifs (short patterns) can form larger structures such as genes, which in turn form chromosomes. These hierarchical structures can be represented as nodes in a tree, where each node has potentially multiple parent nodes and multiple child nodes. Such tree structures are referred to as tree patterns.\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of finding tree patterns with avoidance, where avoidance refers to the absence of a pattern from certain nodes in the tree. We formalize the problem as a pattern avoidance problem in a task-precedence poset, and present a general algorithm that takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of trees. The algorithm is based on dynamic programming, and employs a novel, general purpose, bottom-up, disaggregated recurrence, which we term fold-back. This fold-back operator allows us to decompose the avoidance problem into a set of simpler problems, and to solve these problems in a bottom-up manner.\n\nWe implement our algorithm, and run experiments on a standard benchmark. Our experiments show that our algorithm often outperforms the current state of the art in tree pattern avoidance, and is competitive with the best known algorithms for tree pattern matching, thus establishing pattern avoidance in trees as a new and challenging problem.",
    " Recent works have shown that the choice of evaluation metric can impact the performance of a model; however, in most cases, a single metric is used for model training. In many applications, such as natural language understanding, it is difficult to define a single metric that captures the quality of a model's output. Instead, multiple metrics may be used, each capturing different aspects of the model's behavior. Unfortunately, training a model to maximize all metrics simultaneously is an ill-defined problem, as any optimization algorithm needs an objective function for convergence, and having multiple metrics defined only as constraints can be challenging and may result in unsatisfactory solutions. In this work, we propose a framework where a single model is trained to optimize each metric separately, while still learning useful representations that help the model perform well on other metrics as well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of tasks, including natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and question answering, showing that our approach finds representations that are shared across different metrics, and outperforms models trained with a single metric.",

    " Recent progresses in MRI acquisition techniques have led to an explosion of big imaging data, posing a tremendous challenge for expert manual segmentation. Meanwhile, compared with the abundant labeled images from different domains, the few-shot segmentation setting, where only a few images of specific domains are available for training, is more practical in real-world applications. In this work, we exploit the intrinsic hierarchical structure of segmenting brain MR images from different domains with a deep heteroscedastic multi-task learning (HMT) framework. Specifically, we design a weighted cross-entropy loss to incorporate the heteroscedastic noise of unlabeled data from different domains in an automatic manner. Furthermore, to effectively utilize the limited labeled data, we propose a knowledge distillation strategy that explicitly trains a thinner student network with the learned knowledge from a thicker teacher network pre-trained on abundant data. When trained on a few-shot setting, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for brain MRI segmentation on multiple public datasets, including ISLES, LLC and ADNI. The code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Few-shot-brain-segmentation.",
    " Recent results on salient object detection take a top-down approach, in which the model first detects the foreground and then refines it to obtain the final salient regions. Most existing works focus on designing effective refinement modules to improve the quality of the predicted saliency maps. In this work, we argue that a key problem of current top-down methods is the quality of the initial foreground map, which is usually obtained by thresholding or clamping the output of an encoder. To address this problem, we propose a classifier-guided approach that refines the initial foreground map with a classifier. Specifically, we train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with image-level labels to predict whether a pixel is in the foreground or not. Since the classifier is trained with image-level labels, it is able to exploit global information and capture the underlying object-like structures. Extensive experiments on the salient object detection benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    " Current image segmentation techniques are usually designed to segment images of a specific modality, such as natural images or medical images. This restriction originates from the limitation of the training data as most of the deep learning segmentation models are trained on a specific dataset, which is usually limited to images of a single modality. In this paper, we present a new approach for image segmentation that overcomes this limitation. Our model, called HeMIS, is based on a modification of the U-Net architecture that allows it to handle images of different modalities without the need for retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two different datasets, one for natural images and one for medical images. Our results show that HeMIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets without the need for any modification to the model.",

In the experimental part we evaluate the performance of the strategy by comparing it with the buy-and-hold strategy and with the strategy of investing in the most valuable component at each moment. We find that the Zipf strategy, despite its simplicity, may provide a significant advantage over the other strategies for short investment horizons, like one day.",
    " Recent works on perceptual parsing mainly focus on specific tasks or specific domains, such as scene parsing, object parsing, or person parsing. These methods often utilize separate deep models to handle different tasks, which may result in low efficiency and redundant computations. In this paper, we present a deep grouping model for unified perceptual parsing (DGMP). DGMP introduces a novel pyramid grouping module (PGM) to effectively group and convey multi-scale contextual information, and a joint parsing and refining network (JPRN) to jointly parse and refine the predicted results. Specifically, PGM can automatically group the interested regions and refine the grouped features within a single network architecture, which achieves multiple grouping behaviors with only one forward pass. Furthermore, our JPRN can not only parse the whole image but also refine the predicted results, which further improves the performance. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, DGMP can achieve better performance with a faster inference speed.",

    " Recent works have shown that deep learning models can be robustly attacked via adversarial patches. Such patches are typically crafted manually by humans, which limits their scalability and applicability in real-world attack scenarios.

To avoid the need for an initial collection of patches, we propose a data generation process that uses a patched model to generate in-distribution patch candidates. We implement our approach in the iPatch tool, and show that it can successfully find patches achieving high attack success rates and transfer well to models from other architectures. We evaluate iPatch on ImageNet classifier models as well as popular NLP transformer models, and demonstrate the necessity of patch protection for NLP tasks.",

    " We present stellar population models for the disks of 26 nearby S0 galaxies, based on deep, spatially resolved spectroscopy from Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys observations as part of the SAURON project. We derive the scale lengths of the stellar disks for the S0s, and find them to be uniformly thin, with a characteristic scale length of 4.2 ± 1.4 kiloparsecs. This is similar to the scale length of the Milky Way's stellar disk, but much thinner than the scale lengths typically measured for late-type galaxies. The low dispersion of the scale lengths suggests that the thinning is an evolutionary effect, common to galaxies at the mature stage of their lives. The surface brightness profiles of the stellar disks are well fit by a single exponential profile, except for the central regions, which display a plateau, likely caused by stellar disks whose ages are decreasing inward. The mass density profile ρ(r) of the stellar mass in the galaxies can be fit well by a double exponential profile with a transition radius of about 1.3 disk scale lengths, similar to the transition radius found in the Milky Way. This supports the hypothesis that the stellar mass profiles of S0 galaxies are built up in a similar manner to those of spirals. We determine the orbital velocities and dynamical masses for the S0s, and use these to calculate the projected phase space densities π_∣3¯¹ for the galaxies. The majority of the S0s have π_∣3¯¹≲1, indicating that these galaxies are not dominated by random motion, as would be expected if most of their stellar mass was contained in a diffuse, dynamically hot halo. However, non-negligible contributions to π_∣3¯¹ from the stars in the thin disks, which are dynamically cold, can produce this result. This suggests that the stellar halos of S0s may be much less massive than those of spirals.",
    " Description logic is a widely used formalism for the definition of ontologies. A description logic ontology consists of a set of logical axioms, which define concepts and the relationships between them. These axioms are usually defined in a hierarchical way, with more general concepts being defined first, and more specific concepts being defined in terms of more general ones. This hierarchical structure can be viewed as a tree-like structure, with the most general concepts being the root of the tree, and the more specific concepts being the leaves of the tree.\n\nThe complexity of a description logic ontology is determined by the number of concepts and relationships between them, and the way in which they are defined. A more complex ontology will have more concepts and relationships, and more complex definitions of these concepts and relationships. The complexity of an ontology can also be affected by the structure of the hierarchy of concepts and relationships, as a more complex hierarchy will result in a more complex ontology.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the data complexity of description logic ontologies, that is, the amount of data that is required to represent an ontology, and the complexity of this data in terms of the number of concepts and relationships, and the way in which they are defined. We show that the data complexity of an ontology is related to the structure of the hierarchy of concepts and relationships, and that a more complex hierarchy will result in a more complex ontology in terms of data complexity. We also show that the data complexity of an ontology can be reduced by using a more efficient representation of the hierarchy of concepts and relationships, such as a nested set representation.",
    " Recent progress in deep learning has advanced referring expression comprehension, i.e., the understanding of sparse referring expressions that refer to objects or regions in images or videos, from image regions identification to pixel-wise segmentation. However, existing works mainly focus on 2D referring expression comprehension disregarding the inherent 3D structure of the real world. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multi-modal framework to tackle referring image segmentation, which takes advantages of both referring expressions and geometric constraints, to achieve referring expression comprehension with 3D awareness. Specifically, we first devise a new geometric constraint that leverages the 3D scene structure to obtain initial segmentations. Then, we formulate referring expression comprehension as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem that integrates the referring expression predictions and the geometric constraint. Furthermore, we explore a progressive refinement approach to iteratively refine the segmentation results. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the ReferItSeg dataset, which is a large-scale dataset for referring image segmentation, and achieve state-of-the-art performance.",
    " In this paper, we present CardiacNET, a deep learning framework for the segmentation of the left atrium and proximal pulmonary veins in MRI. Our approach employs a multi-view convolutional neural network (CNN) that utilizes the multiple contrasts and views available in MRI scans for the segmentation task. The multi-view CNN takes advantage of the rich information embedded in the different views and contrasts to improve the segmentation performance. We evaluated our approach on 100 MRI scans and compared it to manual segmentation performed by experts, as well as other state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that CardiacNET achieves an accuracy of 92.3% on the segmentation of the left atrium and 96.2% on the segmentation of the pulmonary veins. When compared to manual segmentation, our approach reduces the error rate by 57.7% for the left atrium and 50.6% for the pulmonary veins.\n\nOur code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/Cardiac-NET/Cardiac-NET.\n\nKeywords: cardiac MRI, deep learning, convolutional neural network, multi-view learning, segmentation.",
    " We introduce a new weakly-supervised segmentation framework that leverages geodesic inter-extreme points (GEIX) for object instance segmentation. Our approach extends the traditional geodesic ellipsoids to a new class of shapes that capture the relationships among multiple objects. This is achieved by optimizing over the manifold of the geometric shapes, referred to as geodesic inter-extreme variations, where the optimization objective is driven by the geometric properties and the label correlations among the objects. We show that the resulting optimization is efficiently solved as a linear programming (LP) problem on certain parametrization of the geodesic inter-extreme variations. In addition, to effectively solve the LP problem, we propose an algorithm that iteratively updates the shapes by performing a series of convex optimizations. We evaluate our approach on the cityscapes dataset, where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches that rely on geodesics.",
    " We show upper bounds on the quantifier depth of graph differentiation, that is, of the problem of expressing in first-order logic the fact that the gradient of a real-valued function defined on a graph is zero at a given point, in terms of the classical quantifier depth of the involved relations.

    " Capturing Omni-Range Context for Omnidirectional Segmentation\n\nMost existing segmentation methods process images sequentially, which hinders\ncapturing long-range context and results in deteriorated performance in\nscenes with extensive object arrangements. In this paper, we tackle the\nsegmentation task from an omnidirectional perception perspective, for\nwhich we propose an Omnidirectional Context Encoding (OCE) framework that\nenables the encoder to capture the omnidirectional context in a single\nforward pass. Specifically, we adopt a centered spherical projection\nto convert the original images into spherical sampled images, and then\nutilize a symmetrical encoder to capture the omnidirectional context.\nIn this way, our model can encode the panoramic context information\nspatially and hierarchically. To handle the segment oversegmentation\nproblem that commonly exists in top-down methods, we propose a novel\nOmnidirectional Guided Refinement (OGR) approach that leverages the\npreviously predicted context to guide the refinement of the segments.\nFurthermore, we propose a Spatially-Reorganized Inference (SRI) module to\nimprove the performance in scenes with complex object arrangements.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmarks, including two public\npanoramic datasets (Cityscapes and Synthia) and two omnidirectional\ndatasets (Scannet and Sun360), demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach against the state-of-the-art both in segment quality and speed.\nThe source code is available at https://github.com/AI4geoLab/OmnilContext.",
    " A novel chaotic image encryption scheme is proposed using generalized threshold function in this paper. The generalized threshold function is constructed by concatenating a couple of standard threshold functions with some XOR operations. The concatenated function makes the output histogram of the plain image unpredictable, which enhances the security of the proposed scheme. In the proposed scheme, the plain image is encrypted via a couple of chaotic systems driven by two sets of control parameters. In order to increase the entropy of the cipher image and make the histogram of the cipher image consistent with that of the original random noise, a random noise is added to the plain image before encryption. Moreover, in order to resist the known-plaintext attack, the control parameters are generated from the key and the plain image. A set of visual attacks resistant metrics is proposed to measure the resilience of the proposed scheme against various attacks. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is resistant to various attacks, and has a higher security compared to the existing schemes.",
    " We introduce the notion of height for piecewise-testable (PT) languages, generalizing the concept of width for regular languages. Given an alphabet of size n, a PT language L has height at most h if each characteristic word of L has length at most h, and L is infinite otherwise. We show that for every infinite PT language L over an alphabet of size n, there is an equivalent PT language of height at most n. This result implies that the height of PT languages is unbounded when the alphabet size is unbounded. We also show that the height of PT languages is strictly smaller than the width of regular languages, thus providing another perspective on the difference between the two classes. Furthermore, we prove that the height of a PT language is equal to the maximum height of its syntactic congruence classes, generalizing a result about the width of regular languages. We investigate the complexity of the logic of subword concatenations, which is a fragment of first-order logic capturing PT languages. We show that the satisfiability problem for this logic is NP-complete, even when the languages involved are regular. On the positive side, we show that the height of a PT language can be decided in polynomial time.",
    " We present a simple parallel algorithm for computing Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay graphs. It is based on a subdivision of the plane into bounded cells, and a distributed data structure for tracking the sites ( incenters ) and bisectors (rays) of the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay graph. The data structure is optimized for the addition and removal of sites, as happens when the diagram is updated during a sequence of insertions and deletions. The algorithm is easy to implement, and has good temporal and spatial complexity. In particular, the time required to update the diagram is logarithmic in the number of sites, and the space required per processor is bounded by a constant, independent of the number of sites.",
    " This paper studies a fourth-order gradient plasticity model which is based on the concept of energy.

    " We show how to use a model of social dynamics, specifically the Deffuant-Weisbuch model, for unsupervised image segmentation. In this model, pixels or regions compete for labels in an iterative process of local refinement and global competition. We introduce a novel multi-scale implementation that allows the model to simultaneously identify objects at multiple scales, and show improvements in segmentation quality as compared to previous approaches. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and show that it computes reasonable segmentations without any parameter tuning or training, and provides a viable alternative to existing approaches in terms of both running time and memory usage.",
    " A robust technique for the segmentation and analysis of cDNA microarray images is presented. The technique is based on the Hough circle transform (HCT). The HCT is applied to detect salient regions in fluorescent images of cDNA microarrays. The detected regions correspond to the location of each spot in the microarray. The radius of the circles detected represents an estimate of the size of each spot. To validate the effectiveness of the presented technique, experimental results are presented where cells were printed on a glass slide using a robotic micro-spotter. By using the HCT, the analysis of the experimental results shows a correct detection of 91% of the spots. The technique is also evaluated using images of cDNA microarrays from public available databases. The obtained results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for automated analysis of cDNA microarray images.",

Throughout the paper, we discuss several practical implementation issues and possible ways of addressing them in order to further improve the computational performance.",
    " Recent progresses in deep learning have achieved great success in semantic segmentation of images in natural domains. However, there are still unsolved problems when applying deep learning to medical images, especially for pathological images. Unlike natural images, pathological images are typically obtained from stained tissue slides, and the appearance of the same tissue region may show substantial variations from slide to slide, even within the same patient. In this paper, we propose a framework to effectively address the challenge of tissue appearance variation by adaptive weighting the features learned from multi-field-of-view (MFOV) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We theoretically prove that the proposed adaptive weighting MFOV CNN can achieve optimal performance in the tissue appearance variation scenario when the weight matrix is known in advance. However, the weight matrix is not available in practice. Therefore, we propose an efficient algorithm to estimate the weight matrix from a small number of training examples. The proposed method is evaluated on two public pathological image datasets (Camelyon17 and SegmentationUltra) with promising results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for semantic segmentation in pathology.",
    " In this paper, we propose a high accurate approach for leaf detection in aerial images.

    " We revisit graph construction for image segmentation. Recent advances in image segmentation algorithms have shown that the graph structure used to process the image plays a crucial role in segmentation performance. Most recent works either adopt hand-crafted graphs, such as the popular watershed transform, or learn the graph structure from the data, which is typically performed in a blind manner, i.e., without any prior knowledge of the underlying image structure. In this work, we propose a data-driven graph construction algorithm that interacts with the user. It allows the user to provide initial segment labels, which our algorithm then uses to construct a graph in an unsupervised manner. We show that our algorithm finds a graph that is better suited for segmenting the image than state-of-the-art graph construction methods. We evaluate our algorithm on the benchmark datasets of SceneParse150 and Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation, and show that our approach achieves competitive results when compared to recent data-driven methods.",
    " In this paper, we construct equivariant A∞-algebras for nonorientable Lagrangians. Our main result shows that the equivariant A∞-algebra for a nonorientable Lagrangian is deformally equivalent to the mirror algebra of the corresponding nonorientable symplectic manifold. This provides a new example of mirror symmetry for symplectic manifolds.\n\nWe also give a general construction of the equivariant A∞-algebra for a symplectic manifold with a group action, and show that it is deformally equivalent to the equivariant cohomology of the symplectic manifold with coefficients in the representation ring of the group. This provides a new way of computing equivariant cohomology.",
    " We present DiNTS, a differentiable neural network topology (DiNTS) search framework for 3D medical image segmentation. DiNTS leverages a fully differentiable hierarchical encoding architecture inspired by self-supervised learning to simultaneously optimize a shared encoder, a set of segmenter architectures, and a topology encoding network. This enables training an ensemble of segmentation models without requiring explicit freezing, saving, or loading of models during training. Furthermore, our framework backpropagates through the entire search process, providing a gradient-based optimization path for the topology search. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on challenging 3D medical image segmentation tasks for which state-of-the-art model ensembles yield significant performance gains compared to single models. We show that DiNTS can identify an optimal ensemble topology that outperform fixed model ensembles by 2.7%, 2.3%, and 2.6% for OT, CT, and PT segmentation on the ISLES dataset, respectively.",
    " The novel follows the life of an anonymous narrator whose life is marked by two great sorrows: his sister's death from lupus shortly before his graduation from college, and a crushing defeat his favorite baseball team suffers in the World Series. The narrator's sister, Amalie, appears only briefly in the narrative but has a profound influence on the narrator, mainly through the letters she writes to him while he is in college. After her death, the narrator searches for some kind of meaning in her life and, through historical research, concludes that she lived a life of tragedy marked by sadness and struggle that she struggles heroically to overcome.\n\nThe narrator's baseball team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, provides another focal point for the narrator's obsession with suffering and defeat. The narrator becomes obsessed with the Dodgers after seeing a Dodgers game on his way to attend his sister's funeral. He becomes convinced that the Dodgers' history is marked by failure and sadness, starting with the team's departure from Brooklyn to avoid a tax bill. The team's failure to win the World Series, despite many chances, only reinforces the narrator's belief in the Dodgers' doom. However, the narrator's belief that the Dodgers' front office is filled with greedy, selfish people who prioritize winning over fair play and kindness leads him to believe that the Dodgers' misfortunes result from divine justice.\n\nThe narrator's own life is filled with sadness and suffering. He fails to make meaningful connections with other people, in part because of his own self-centeredness and detachment. He marries twice, has a son, and becomes a successful writer, but he is unable to prevent his life from being haunted by the deaths of his sister and his father, who dies a few years after his wife's death. In the end, the narrator concludes that there is no meaning in life and that humanity's attempts to find meaning are doomed to failure.

While there, Lakshmi must cope with the complexities of her relationships with her husband, her mother-in-law, and her sister-in-law. During her visit, she opens a letter left by her husband which includes a pair of blue eyes drawn on it—which matches the eyes of a woman named Naresh, her sister-in-law. Disturbed, Lakshmi tears up the letter. Thereafter, strange things happen to Lakshmi: she begins to have visions of a blue-eyed woman; she almost suffocates when trapped in a room with a statue of a blue-eyed goddess; and she sees the tail of a snake slip into her mother-in-law's room. Subsequently, Lakshmi's mother-in-law is found dead, having apparently drowned in the bathtub. Lakshmi's husband is convinced that his mother's death was suicide, but Lakshmi is convinced that she was murdered.

Naresh moves into the body of her husband, who was driving Lakshmi back to Delhi at the time, and attempts to kill Lakshmi. However, unable to control the body, Naresh/husband drives off a cliff, killing them both.",

    " On the morning of September 11, 2001, virtually the entire world witnessed the horror of coordinated terrorism attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Both buildings were hit by commercial airliners allegedly piloted by Arabs, and a third airliner crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania after its passengers mounted a counterattack on the terrorists. At the time there was confusion over the events, and some conspiracy theorists asserted that the World Trade Center was destroyed by a controlled demolition. Over the following years, extensive evidence proved that the terrorists were from Saudi Arabia and Egypt and not from Iraq as some had initially claimed. The 9/11 Truth Movement began to argue that the Bush Administration had either encouraged or allowed the attacks to occur for motives either related to economics or because the Administration wanted to invade Iraq. These theories have been promoted in books, films and websites, with some of the filmmakers and publishers being controversial. On May 29, 2011, the United States Department of Justice announced that it had identified five hijackers who died in the attacks. Three of them were from Saudi Arabia and two from Egypt. The identities of all 19 hijackers have now been officially released. 9/11: The Big Lie focuses on the theory that the World Trade Center was destroyed by a government conspiracy. It mentions no credible evidence for this allegation, and the extensive evidence rebutting it is not cited. The movie evokes the conspiracy theories advanced by Kurt Sonnenfeld, who claimed that a compact object exploded inside the North Tower and helicopters were filming the event. He allegedly witnessed an attempt to blow up Building 7, which was unsuccessful. He also claims to have seen military helicopters removing evidence from the site. The movie makes several inaccurate claims. It says that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found no trace of airplanes, which is incorrect. It also says that there were many confirmed eyewitnesses who saw missiles hitting the World Trade Center; in fact, only a few people have made this claim and they have not been credible. The movie also asserts that the phone calls from the planes were faked, but in fact the 9/11 Commission determined that the phone calls were genuine. It was also noted by the FBI and 9/11 Commission that the phone calls helped with the investigation, and several of them have been verified through records. The movie claims that the planes which hit the World Trade Center had no passengers and were remote-controlled; however, the 9/11 Commission Report and the NIST study refer to the",

    " The Battle of Life is a novel written by Jane Austen in 1817, and published posthumously in 1850. It was originally titled 'Lady Susan, domestically addressed to a lady residing in Ireland'. The story is about the lives of the Dashwood family, focusing on the sisters Elinor and Marianne, and their relationships. The novel shows the new conditions of romance by contrasting the older and younger generations' experience of love, and also how the discovery of secret betrayals and love's ability to forgive can revive relationships.\n\nThe novel begins several years after the death of Henry Dashwood, who extravagantly cared for his wife and daughters. As a result of his spending and the Strict laws of inheritance in England at the time, the family is left in reduced circumstances, forced to leave their ancestral home of Norland Park for a smaller property in Devonshire, called Barton Cottage. The novel describes how each of the four sisters reacts to their new situation, and how they find love. The romantic ideals of the younger generation are contrasted with the pragmatic approach of their mothers, a generation that experienced sexual liberation before the Revolutionary war, but had to be far more practical in their approach to marriage.\n\nThe story explores the issue of marriage, in particular how women in the 19th century were expected to marry, usually for economic security, and how a woman of good character might compromise her values in order to achieve this.",

He is summoned by Sir Pellinore, who has received information that a group of Nazis, led by a man named Gruenfelder, are attempting to use black magic to bring about an early victory for Germany.\n\nSallust and Sir Pellinore assemble a team to infiltrate the Nazis' secret headquarters, which is located in a ruined castle in the Black Forest. The team consists of Sallust, Sir Pellinore, Richard Eaton, and a woman named Christine Melford, who is an expert in witchcraft and black magic.\n\nAs the team infiltrates the castle, they discover that the Nazis have been using a combination of black magic and advanced technology to create a powerful weapon that can control the weather. The weapon is powered by the life forces of hundreds of kidnapped British children, who have been taken from their homes and imprisoned in the castle.\n\nSallust and his team manage to destroy the weapon and save the children, but not before Sir Pellinore is killed in the battle. In the end, Sallust and Richard Eaton emerge as the heroes of the story, and they vow to continue fighting against the Nazis and their evil schemes.\n\nThe Dark Abode is typical of Wheatley's black magic novels, which blend elements of horror, suspense, and action with a strong element of humor and a dose of patriotism.

    " \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" is a novel written by Friedrich Nietzsche and published in four volumes between 1883 and 1885. It presents a fictionalized account of the teachings of the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra and incorporates many of Nietzsche's ideas about humanity, religion, and the meaning of life.\n\nThe first three sections of the book, entitled \"The Gay Science,\" \"Out of the Deeps,\" and \"The Despisers of the Body,\" respectively, lay the groundwork for the teachings of Zarathustra. The prophet first appears in the prologue, which serves as an introduction to the entire work. In the prologue, Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman, the human embodiment of divinity, is his successor.\n\nThe remainder of the book is divided into nine parts, each of which is a discourse by Zarathustra on a different subject. These include the nature of the Superman, the value of solitude, the importance of self-overcoming, the wisdom of the serpent, the metamorphosis of values, the will to power, the superman as the embodiment of the will to power, and the ultimate goal of the superman as the creator of his own values.\n\nThroughout the book, Zarathustra advocates a life of self-overcoming and the creation of one's own values as the highest form of human existence. He criticizes traditional values, such as those embodied by the Christian church, as manifestations of the \"herd instinct\" that lead to the degradation of the individual. He also condemns the rationality and materialism of contemporary society, arguing that these values are insufficient for truly understanding the world and the human condition.\n\nIn the final section of the book, entitled \"The Sign,\" Zarathustra disappears, and a character named The Devil attempts to deceive Zarathustra's disciples into following him instead. However, they remain loyal to Zarathustra's teachings and resist the Devil's temptations. The book ends with the disciples discovering a tablet on which is written, \"Thus spoke Zarathustra.\"\n\n\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" is considered one of Nietzsche's most important works and has had a significant influence on modern philosophy and literature. It is known for its poetic language, philosophical depth, and provocative ideas, which have continued to generate debate and discussion among scholars and readers alike.",

    " In Idaho in the 1970s, Salamanca Tree Hiddle, a 13-year-old girl who was named after a city in Spain, tells the story of her missing mother, who abandoned her when she was a baby and who she calls \"the mother person.\" In classic coming-of-age fashion, Sal entertains many theories about her mother's absence during her childhood, including that her mother was a witch who turned herself into a bear and briefly became trapped in a magical dimension (this theory comes from Sal's eccentric father, who believes in omens and dreams). Sal's father, who is rarely around and often distracted, travels with a carnival, and leaves Sal in the care of her grandparents, who live in the small town of Three Oaks. Sal's grandparents are kind to her, but they are old and ailing, and they do not understand Sal's sometimes outlandish behavior, which includes her tendency to dress in costumes and her preoccupation with fairy tales and myths. Frustrated by their inability to connect with Sal, they send her to live with her aunt, April, who is only slightly more understanding of Sal's eccentricities. April is raising her daughter, Phoebe, while simultaneously helping her husband, Charles, with his campaign for state senator.

    " Roisin O'Connor: From blues rock to hip hop, this year's best albums take us on a journey through a multifaceted 2020\n\n2020 has been a year of colossal loss – of lives, of security, of plans. Arts industries have been shattered and music is no exception.\n\nBut in dark times, great art can inspire, and comfort. This year's standout albums have provided both – a welcome escape, and a reflection of our seething, aching world.\n\nFrom hip hop to jazz, soulful R&B to synth-pop, the diversity of 2020's offering has been more pronounced than ever. In a year of video calls and social distancing, these albums have transported us elsewhere – and helped us make sense of the present.\n\nHere are some of the year's standout releases:\n\nFigures\nAmerican singer-songwriter Emily King's R&B album, Lovers Rock, is an exquisite collection of soulful songs. The album's title is a reference to London's 1980s blues parties – home to the \"lovers rock\" sound, an underground British reggae style. King's tender, seductive vocals are perfectly complemented by 70s-style funk and disco rhythms.\n\nKing has described the album as \"therapy\", and its themes of love, loss and hope are a balm for the soul. The album's lyrics evoke the feeling of \"making love in the morning, and walking in the sunshine\", King says. \"Those small, beautiful things that we need to hold on to\".\n\nBritish jazz musician Alfa Mist's second studio album, Bring Backs, is a worthy follow-up to his acclaimed debut, Antiphon. The album features a diverse range of collaborators, including hip hop artist Kojey Radical and singer Greentea Peng. Mist's soulful piano melodies are the perfect vehicle for his reflections on urban life, lost love and the search for meaning.\n\nHis lyrics are wise beyond his years, exploring the human condition with nuanced understanding. \"Let's face it / We're just trying to get by,\" he raps on Now / Never. Bring Backs is a sublime album, full of atmospheric, reflective gems.\n\nHip hop\nAmerican rapper Earl Sweatshirt's fourth studio album, Feet of Clay, is a poignant and personal exploration of the artist's psyche. The album's title is a reference to the Book of Daniel's tale of metallurgist Azariah, whose bronze feet were made weak by God so that he would be forced to rely on God",
    " BBC Sport football correspondent Mark Lawrenson on the challenges facing Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez.\n\nWhen Liverpool appointed Rafael Benitez as manager in the summer of 2004, I thought they had got the best man for the job.\n\nI still think that, despite the fact the Spaniard has not come close to delivering the Premier League title that everyone associated with Liverpool wanted so badly.\n\nBenitez has not had the money to spend that his main Premier League rivals have - but that is no excuse.\n\nIn his first season at Anfield, he failed to mount a serious title challenge but did win a trophy - the European Champions League.\n\nThat success, and the manner in which Liverpool achieved it, justified the decision to give Benitez the job and tempered some of the disappointment at not being in the hunt for the title.\n\nThis season, however, Liverpool have been nowhere near the top of the Premier League and look certain to finish outside the top four.\n\nSo, just over two years into his five-year contract, Benitez is under pressure to deliver success - and quickly.\n\nHe has improved the team defensively but his purchases in that area - Jose Reina, Jamie Carragher, Steve Finnan and Daniel Agger - were already on the books.\n\nBenitez got them playing as a more cohesive unit and that has been to the team's benefit - but it is still not good enough.\n\nThe new season offers Benitez the chance to make amends and he will be encouraged by the fact that Liverpool have made a promising start in the Champions League.\n\nThey have also been scoring goals for fun in the Carling Cup but, in the Premier League, they have already dropped 10 points.\n\nBenitez knows he must convince the club's American owners, George Gillett and Tom Hicks, that he is the right man to deliver success.\n\nAnd he will also be only too aware that the longer he goes without winning something, the more the pressure on him will increase.\n\nBenitez can point to the fact that he has not had the money to spend that Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City have had in recent seasons - and he is right.\n\nBut he has spent about £60m on players since he arrived at Anfield and some of those purchases - like Peter Crouch and Dirk Kuyt - have not been successful.\n\nHe also made what now looks like the mistake of allowing X",
    " The Conservative party is opposing a move to allow 24-hour drinking in England and Wales.\n\nMinisters say the plan - backed by the government - would increase violence and disorder.\n\nThe proposal is part of the Licensing Bill currently going through Parliament.\n\nThe party is threatening to defeat the government on the issue when the bill reaches the House of Commons in the autumn.\n\nThe BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said MPs were considering offering a compromise proposal on the issue.\n\nHe said this would involve offering local areas the chance to have later opening hours, but with restrictions on providing 24-hour drinking everywhere.\n\nAnd he said some senior ministers were urging Prime Minister Tony Blair to drop the proposal - due to come into force in 2009 - altogether.\n\nThe bill, which aims to simplify the licensing system, is currently being considered by the House of Lords.\n\nMinisters say it will cut red tape for the licensing industry, but the Conservative party - and many police forces - say it will lead to a surge in binge drinking.\n\nShadow home secretary David Davis said earlier this week that the bill posed a \"major threat to public order\".\n\n\"It is quite simply insane... to consider encouraging people to drink around the clock,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not just talking about a few extra hours' drinking a day - this is radically changing the whole culture of drinking.\"\n\nBut the government argues the bill offers the chance to restrict drinking hours, if that is what local areas want.\n\nAnd Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell has argued the bill will allow local areas to decide on the \"appropriate level of opening hours\".\n\n\"That is the right approach because it is dangerous to assume that one-size-fits-all,\" she said.\n\n\"What works in London may not work in Lichfield.\"\n BBC News website readers have been giving their views on the issue:\n\n\"It's about time this country entered the 21st century. Other countries have had this for years and we are still stuck in the 1930s.\"\n\n\"As a mother of three teenagers, I am totally against this extension. The idea that it is going to be up to local councils is just laughable, most of them are run by idiots who wouldn't know what was best for their areas.\"\n\n\"It's a good idea if it's controlled properly, but that is a big IF. I just hope we don't see the sale of alcohol",
    " Media conglomerate News Corp has made a $107bn offer to buy video game publisher Nintendo, marking the company's push into the video games market.\n\nThe move comes as Nintendo's profits have fallen due to the rapid growth of mobile gaming, though it remains best known for its Switch console and classic franchises like Mario and The Legend of Zelda.\n\nNews Corp, which owns newspapers like the Times and the Sun, as well as broadcasting outlets like Fox News, already has a toehold in the market due to its 2021 acquisition of social gaming company Aspyr.\n\nAspyr has produced dozens of games, including Star Wars: Invasion and Fallout: New Vegas, and has developed titles for Nintendo's previous consoles, the Wii and the 3DS.\n\nNews Corp's chief executive, Robert Thomson, said the company would be \"thrilled\" to acquire Nintendo and described the Japanese company as \"an artistic powerhouse\".\n\n\"We are keen to learn from Nintendo's extraordinary history and we view this as an ideal opportunity for both companies to flourish together,\" he added in a statement.\n\nNintendo said it had not received formal notice of the offer and therefore refused to comment.\n\nNews of the offer comes just days after Nintendo unveiled its latest console, the Switch OLED model, marking the first time the company has updated its flagship device since the Switch's launch in 2017.\n\nNintendo's offering includes a seven-inch OLED screen, a wider adjustable stand, and improved audio, among other features.\n\nThe Tokyo-based company has also recently focused on its subscription service, Nintendo Switch Online, which offers customers access to a library of games from the NES and SNES era.\n\nNews Corp's offer represents a premium of 43% on Nintendo's closing price of 79,500 yen on Tuesday.

    " Algeria hit by further gas riots\n\nDemonstrators have blocked roads and ports in Algeria's capital, Algiers, protesting over the government's decision to halt energy subsidies.\n\nThe rare protests have prompted the government to reverse its decision on subsidies.\n\nThe move forced several foreign oil and gas companies to halt production.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government removed pump price caps on petrol and diesel, prompting an immediate rise in prices.\n\nPrice controls on butane and propane, used for cooking and heating, were due to be removed on 1 January. \n\nBut the government has now said it will postpone any price increases.\n\nThe nationwide protests - the largest in Algeria for years - have opposed any rise in the cost of gas products.\n\nState energy company Sonatrach often sells gas at well below international prices or even at a loss\n\nThe government had argued that it could no longer afford to subsidise the price of gas, as it does for butane and propane.\n\nAlgeria is estimated to spend more than $10bn (£6.6bn) a year on energy subsidies, accounting for more than 10% of the state budget.\n\nThe economy has been hard hit by the fall in oil and gas prices over the past year.\n ambulanciers tend to an injured person during a protest against rising costs of living in Algiers, Algeria December 27, 2017.\n\nThe halt in gas output led to shortened working hours for many factories and businesses which depend on gas for their production.\n\nIt also forced several exporters - including Dutch-British firm Shell and Italy's ENI - to cancel exports.\n\nOn Thursday, Shell said it was preparing to restart loading cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at its Arzew plant.\n\nAlgeria is Africa's largest gas exporter and ranks among the top ten global LNG exporters.\n\nThe protests are a rarity in Algeria, where the opposition has been silenced through decades of state repression and the political climate has been relatively stable since a 1991 civil war.",
    " High-quality photo printers for PCs are challenging the traditional dominance of silver halide photographers, who use expensive equipment to produce glossy, colour-accurate prints.\n\nCheap, desktop printers can now produce near-photographic quality and are starting to be used by professional photographers.\n\nSilver halide printers have until now been the only way professionals could produce high-quality prints.\n\nBut increasingly, photographers are using digital cameras and PCs, and printing the results on their desktop printers.\n\n Epson, Canon and Hewlett-Packard all produce photo-quality printers that can connect to PCs. Prices of the machines range between $150 and $1,000 (£94 to £570).\n\nSupplies are relatively cheap - with sets of four colour ink cartridges costing about $30 (£19). By contrast, silver halide processing can cost up to $20 (£13) a print.\n\nCheap printers cannot yet match the quality of the silver halide process, which involves exposing light onto layers of chemically treated paper to produce an image.\n\nBut desktop printers are getting closer. The quality of prints from some inkjet printers \"is astonishing\", said Simon Barter, editor of Digital Photo Magazine.\n\n\"Epson's Photo 1800 and Canon's iP4 are incredible. They are producing prints that are better than anything you could get from a lab. And they are as good as anything from a silver halide print,\" he added.\n\nMr Barter said the main advantage of inkjet printers was that \"you have total control of the printing process. There is no middleman.\n\n\"And you can print images any time you want. There is no need to go into town, select your images and wait a week to get the prints back.\"\n\nBut there are drawbacks with desktop printers. Colour accuracy is not as good as silver halide and users have to spend time finessing the images on their PCs before printing.\n\nAnd while the printers are getting better, they are still unable to produce the same quality as silver halide. Silver halide prints have a smoother gradation from light to dark and a greater density of colour.\n\nThey also have a distinctive glossy finish. The inks used in inkjet printers do not sit on the surface of the paper in the same way that silver halide chemicals do.\n\nThis means that while inkjet prints have a greater density of colour, their finish is often more matte.\n\nBut experts say the gap between inkjet prints and silver halide is closing",

    " UKIP's secret weapon?\n## mick bloom\n### [*prime minister* 2024] \n\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about UKIP's breakthrough in the Euro elections last week was how unremarkable it was. Barely a squeak of surprise, barely a hint of shock.\n\nYes, the BBC's projection of a UKIP victory was bettered only by the one that said Elvis was alive and well - until the reporter caught up with him in Australia.\n\nAnd sure enough, come the morning after, most of the mainstream press was suddenly consumed with the urgent need to compute new Tory leaders, and new Labour leaders - but not for UKIP. \n\nIt felt a bit like 1992, when Boris Johnson smugly dismissed the newly-elected John Major as a \"one-trick pony\", only to be chased out of office four years later by the same one-trick pony, propelled by the shattering roar of the referendum campaign.\n\nBut this time there was no roar. There was no realisation that, in the words of UKIP's sole MP, Douglas Carswell, something \"profound\" had happened.\n\nSomething profound, but irrevocably ignored - and that's precisely the point. This time it was meant to be different. This time, with 25% of the vote, UKIP would take the Westminster crown. This time, there would be no Saxon surprise.\n\nExcept there was - and it's a doozy. Because UKIP's secret weapon isn't barking mad Barratt or bonkers Bloom - it's you. It's us. It's the media. \n\nWe cannot stop talking about them. We cannot resist giving them coverage - and, as a result, they are reaching a far wider audience than their support base would suggest.\n\nIn the week before the election, the BBC's Question Time featured UKIP - not the other main parties. The day after the election, the BBC's Daily Politics show did the same - again, not the other main parties. \n\nBy contrast, the BNP, with almost as many votes, got three minutes on BBC Breakfast. \n\nUKIP has benefited from hundreds of column inches, and hours of broadcast time. The Sun, which ignored the BNP, has devoted its front page not once, but four times to UKIP - including the day after the election, when it splashed on \"Kippers\" defying the odds.\n\nEven the normally levels-headed Alastair Campbell has succumbed,",
    " Star Wars Battlefront 2 review\n\nIt's the game Star Wars fans have been waiting for, but that doesn't mean it's perfect.\n\nStar Wars Battlefront 2 has plenty of bugs and some confusing design decisions, but if you can look past those there's plenty here to love.\n\nIt's taken three years and a change of developer, but we finally have a proper successor to the original Star Wars Battlefront games.\n\nThey're online multiplayer shooters, but with a Star Wars skin.\n\nThe original Battlefront games were essentially Battlefield games in disguise, and that's still true here.\n\nThe highlight is definitely the multiplayer modes - preferably played with a friend.\n\nThe meat of the multiplayer is made up of three different modes - Galactic Assault, Starfighter Assault and Strike.\n\nThey're basically your standard team deathmatch, vehicle deathmatch and conquest modes, but with a Star Wars skin.\n\nThey're simple, but still pretty exhilarating, especially when playing as or against iconic Star Wars characters and vehicles.\n\nThe controls are fairly simple, but it takes a while to get used to the floaty cover system.\n\nThe lack of a proper single player campaign is still pretty baffling though, and the one included here doesn't even come close to filling that void.\n\nThe campaign is a series of battles against the Empire, essentially a prolonged tutorial.\n\nIt's not particularly engaging, but at least it's short - lasting around two hours.\n\nBattlefront 2 has some frustrating design decisions, but it has heart.\n\nIt looks gorgeous, and sounds amazing, but a lack of content and some baffling design decisions hold it back.\n\nThe original Battlefront games had a seemingly endless number of modes, but this one feels sparse in comparison.\n\nThe lack of a single player campaign is also confusing, especially when the one included here is so lacklustre.\n\nBut if you can look past those issues there's still a lot of fun to be had - especially when playing as a Jedi.\n\nStar Wars Battlefront 2 was released on November 17 for PS4, Xbox One and PC.\n\nOur review is based on the PS4 version.\n\nGame description\n\nStar Wars Battlefront 2 is an action game played from either a first-person or third-person perspective. The game, inspired by the Star Wars franchise, is designed primarily as a multiplayer game, but also includes a single-player story mode",
    " Textile jobs: Millions 'to lose jobs' \n\nThe UK textile industry could lose almost 400,000 jobs in the next decade, an industry body has warned.\n\nThe Textile Institute said jobs would go because of rising energy prices, competition from India and China, and the cheap availability of textiles on the internet.\n\nIt wants the government to provide more support for the industry.\n\nThe institute's Russellislife Hall said there was a danger that the UK would end up simply being a designer of textiles, with the actual making of fabrics taken over by abroad.\n\nTextiles are the UK's largest manufacturing industry, with 73,000 directly employed in the sector and a further 135,000 in related industries.\n\nBut the Textile Institute, which commissioned the Nomis consultancy to carry out the study into the future of the sector, believes that by 2012, the number of directly employed will have fallen to 47,000, with an additional 77,000 in related industries.\n\nThis suggests that 350,000 jobs could go, although the Textile Institute admits it is difficult to be precise because the figures are based on trends and there is a certain amount of uncertainty involved.\n\n'Potent combination'\n\n\"There is a potent combination of factors [that threaten jobs],\" Mr Hall said.\n\n\"It is the rise of energy prices, the internet - which has dramatically changed the retail landscape - and most importantly the massive increase in capacity in China and India.\n\n\"While the markets in the US and Europe have been fairly stable, the growth markets of China and India represent a significant threat to the UK textile industry as their disposable incomes rise and their demand for textiles increases.\"\n\nThe study also found that the average age of those employed in the industry was increasing, with a quarter of the workforce due to retire in the next 10 years.\n\nThis will create a skills gap, it said.\n\nThe Textile Institute is now calling on the government to do more to support the industry, including greater funding for training and help in combating rising energy prices.",

    " Could Yukos be a blessing in disguise?\n\nFor the last few years Russia's biggest oil company has been fighting for its life. Yukos Oil Company is up to its neck in debt and last year saw its production slump to a 17-year low. Now it has been hit with a massive tax bill which could ultimately send it bankrupt. But some analysts think this could be a blessing in disguise, allowing the company to streamline its operations and come out fighting. It has already announced plans to sell off its petrol station network. And on Wednesday its chief executive, Aleksandr Dyukov, said the company was planning to tap its shareholders for as much as $8bn dollars as part of a restructuring plan. He said the company would sell new shares and cut its massive debt by half. But analysts say the company also needs to sell more of its key assets in order to survive. \"Yukos is losing its market position and must quickly sell non-core assets, and increase production and efficiency,\" said Andrei Kramarenko, an analyst with Renaissance Capital. \"Otherwise it will disappear.\"\n\nThe company has already signed a deal to sell its Nova television station and some property in Moscow. But it could also be forced to sell its main production unit, Yukos Arktic, as well as its shares in the Siberian Light Oil Company and some refineries. \"All these assets are going to be sold. The question is when and at what price,\" said Mr Kramarenko. But he said the sale of Yukos's petrol station network would not be enough on its own to help the company out of its difficulties. \"It's nothing special, it's a typical market price, nothing extraordinary.\"\n\nYukos has been hit by a series of tax claims which have helped to push the company into debt. The tax authorities say the company owes them $3.3bn dollars, a figure Yukos says is far too high. But earlier this month a court in Moscow ordered the company to pay $315m dollars of the claim, and the tax authorities have said they will not rule out bankruptcy proceedings against the company. The authorities have also put Yukos's main production unit up for auction in order to help pay the tax bill. Yukos says this is illegal and has appealed to Russia's highest court.\n\nBut analysts say the battle with the tax authorities is also helping to strengthen Yukos's hand against its rivals. \"The tax case is bad for Yukos but good for shareholders because it makes the",
    " Council tax rises in England billed as \"reasonable\" have been approved, with many authorities freezing fares for motorists. The averages rises for bands A to D in England are below what was forecast a year ago. Authorities in England have approved the rises, with averages ranging from £50 to £70. The increases are usually introduced in April. Council bosses say the hikes are needed to protect vital services from the impact of government grant cuts. And Labour says the Conservative government has cut council funding by half over the last decade. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said extra funding raised by the rises could be as much as £1.9bn.\n\nManchester, the country's largest council by population, has approved a 9.5% rise, which equates to an extra £74 a year for a band D property. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the rise was \"difficult but necessary\". He said: \"There is no easy way to introduce a council tax rise, but these are difficult financial times and hard choices have to be made.\" The authority has had its government funding cut by £60m. It comes as the city's bus network is being completely overhauled with new simplified routes and £1.2bn investment.\n\n Elsewhere, Tory-run Westminster City Council has become the latest local authority to freeze fares for motorists. It joins others including Portsmouth, Southampton and Marlow which have also chosen not to increase fees. The Local Government Association (LGA) has welcomed the \"modest increases\". LGA chairman Clive Betts said the rises would help protect services. He added: \"Councils have worked hard to keep increases down as much as possible to protect local services.\"",

England have won just one of their past 10 Tests in Ireland - a 39-10 victory in Dublin in 2003 - and have lost their last four visits to the Aviva Stadium, including the memorable 2019 Six Nations game which saw Ireland win a Grand Slam and England's hopes of winning the title ended.\n\nIreland have also lost just one of their previous 13 home Tests - against New Zealand in November - and have won their last nine under coach Andy Farrell.\n\nEngland have been boosted by the return to fitness of centre Ollie Lawrence and flanker Tom Curry, who have both recovered from injury, while Ireland have selected uncapped pair Michael Lowry and Nick McCarthy.\n\nLowry, who has impressed for Ulster in the United Cup this season, is selected at full-back in a much-changed squad which sees Billy Burns and Robbie Henshaw partnered in the centre.\n\nMcCarthy, who has been in fine form for Leinster, is included among the replacements alongside fellow uncapped players Craig Casey and Jeremy Loughman.\n\nIreland head coach Andy Farrell said: \"This weekend is a special occasion for Michael and Nick.

They point out that digital television took 15 years to become mainstream, and suggest that digital radio is still in its infancy.\n\n\"The technology is ahead of the consumer",

    " The BBC news article \"Downloads enter US singles chart\" published on February 5, 2010 outlines how downloads have officially entered the US singles chart. The song \"Crush\" by David Archuleta debuted at number forty on the Billboard Hot 100 with digital downloads included in the measurements. This marks the first time a song has entered the charts under the new methodology in which downloads are included in the tally sheet. Previously, songs were measured by physical CD sales only. \n\nIndustry experts predict that downloads will level the playing field for established artists and new stars.

    " Fiat is considering floating 10% of Ferrari on the stock market in an operation that could value the supercar maker at about $9bn.\n\nThe move would help Fiat reduce debt and help fund a costly shift towards producing electric and hybrid cars.\n\nFerrari's Formula One team has already been spun off and listed in New York.\n\nThe company - controlled by the Agnelli family's Exor investment group - has been under pressure from shareholders to unlock the value of its assets following the death of Sergio Marchionne last year.\n\nThe flotation of Ferrari, which is being advised by Bank of America, would be the latest in a series of moves by Fiat to raise money by offloading assets.\n\nThe Italian carmaker sold Chrysler and its components business in 2018 and spun off Magneti Marelli, its components business, earlier this year.\n\nBy selling part of Ferrari - a group with annual earnings of more than $1bn - Fiat would be able to cut its debt, which stood at 17.4 billion euros ($19.6bn) at the end of June.\n\n Analysts said that the valuation of 35 billion euros ($39bn) that had been reported in the Italian press would be too low and that Ferrari - famous for its roaring V12 engines - could be worth as much as $50bn.\n\nThat would make it worth more than Ford, which has a market capitalisation of about $45bn, and comparable with General Motors, which has a value of $52bn.\n\nThe plans to list at least part of Ferrari come just months after the Agnelli family assured investors that the company was not for sale.\n\nA 10% float would give Fiat a war chest of several billion dollars to spend on new technologies, including hybrid and electric cars, as the industry faces huge investments to meet tougher emissions standards.\n\nFiat has already said it would need to spend more than €50bn ($56bn) in the next five years to meet these rules.\n\nThe group, which also owns the Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep brands, has said it wants to list in New York, but a final decision has not been made.\n\nBy listing in New York, Fiat would be following in the footsteps of another iconic Italian brand, Armani, which recently filed for an IPO in the US.\n\nThe move would be a blow for the Milan stock exchange, where the Fiat group has been listed since 2004.\n\nA Ferrari float would also",

    " BT has announced it will be offering free internet phone calls to customers, the BBC reported. The UK's largest telecoms provider said calls would be free whether made to fixed-line or mobile phones, or even international numbers. However, calls will only be free if they are made via broadband and not via the mobile phone network, BT said. The company said it wanted to \"future-proof\" its customers' phone bills and \"evolve\" the traditional landline. Industry regulator Ofcom said it would \"carefully review\" the offer, to ensure it complied with its rules, which state that providers must be clear about any price differences between using a landline or internet service. In its statement, BT said its customers would need to have an active subscription to BT Broadband and a compatible router to benefit from the offer. Once they had signed up, they would be able to make free calls anytime, anywhere, the company said. Landline and broadband customers will be able to sign up from November, while EE mobile customers can do so in January.\n\nIt comes as BT, which still boasts 12 million landline customers, recently reported a quarterly rise in profits, boosted by growth in its broadband and mobile services. The company said it wanted to \"reward our loyal customers and attract new ones\". A spokesman for BT told the BBC the company was \"confident\" the offer would not result in a \"material decline\" in the number of calls made via the landline network. Landlines continue to be used by many customers for regular phone calls, as well as taking advantage of offers such as free weekends and cheap evening calls, said Marc Allera, CEO of BT's consumer division.",

    " New wearable helps golfers correct their swing\nA new wearable device that provides real-time audio feedback could help golfers improve their swing.\n\nThe Mobile Motion Tracker (MMT) is a lightweight, wireless, sensor that attaches to the golfer's belt. It measures the movements of the hips, upper body and hands during a swing and sends information to a smartphone app, via Bluetooth.\n\nThe app analyses the movements and tells the golfer how to improve via headphones.\n\n\"We wanted to find a way for golfers to get feedback on their swing as they are practicing, and not just from a coach at the end of a session,\" said Meladee Lindsey, from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, who led the team that developed the MMT.\n\n\"The sensor sends data to the app, which then produces an audio report at the end of each swing,\" she told the BBC.\n\nMs Lindsey said the device could be used by golfers of all abilities to improve their game.\n\n\"When you practise you generally don't have feedback while you are doing it,\" she said. \"Most of the time you have to synthesise everything that you did at the end of a practise session.\n\n\"Having audio feedback while you are still on the driving range allows you to make any changes needed to correct your swing while it is still fresh in your mind.\"\n\nThe device could be particularly helpful for less-skilled golfers, said Ms Lindsey.\n\n\"Amateur golfers in particular stand to benefit from wearing this device because they often don't have the funds to take lessons from a pro coach,\" she said.\n\n\"This could be a cheaper way to get feedback on their swing and it's a tool that could help them to self-improve.\"\n\nThe MMT was developed by a team from Georgia Tech and the Alfred Mann Foundation, a non-profit organisation that helps develop technologies to help disabled people.\n\nThe foundation is now looking for industry partners to commercialise the MMT.\n\n\"The initial goal of the device was to help rehabilitate patients who have had a stroke,\" said Georgia Tech research scientist Ervin Sejdic.\n\n\"But we have found that the device has a lot of applications in other areas, such as sports and entertainment.\"\n\nIn addition to golf, the MMT could be used to help improve a person's posture or to monitor vibrations from machinery.",

    " Ingredients\n   None\n\nInstructions\n   Take about 2 tablespoons of anpan dough and shape into a ball in your hands. Press your thumb deep into the center of the dough ball to make an indentation (this will be where the sweet bean paste goes).\n   Place onto a baking sheet (with parchment paper if desired for easy cleanup). Repeat until you have used up all of the dough.\n   Fill the indentation with sweet bean paste (about 1 teaspoon or so per dough ball). Be careful not to overfill or the bean paste will leak out and burn during baking.\n   Top with black sesame seeds.\n   Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes. The underbelly should be golden brown.\n   Remove from oven and let cool slightly before eating. Can be served warm or at room temperature.\n\nDescription\n   This is a basic anpan recipe that produces plump and fluffy treats with just the right amount of sweetness to the bread and a delicious bean paste filling. For even fluffier bread, you can try the Tangzhong method- see the advanced recipe for details. \n\nIngredient Substitutions\n   Sweet bean paste: You can use storebought sweet bean paste (also known as anko) or make your own. If you are making your own, you will need about 1 1/2 cups of cooked adzuki beans (tinned or prepared from dry beans) and 1/2 cup of sugar. Mash the beans together with the sugar and a splash of water (enough to make the mixture smooth and paste-like) and proceed with the recipe.\n   Black sesame seeds: You can find bagged black sesame seeds in the Asian foods section of larger supermarkets or at Asian markets. You can also use white sesame seeds if you prefer.\n   Anpan dough: Anpan dough is simply sweet bread dough. You can use any sweet bread dough from a recipe you like (including dough prepared from a bread machine recipe or a packaged mix). Make sure the dough is not too thin or the anpan will not have a nice, plump appearance.",

    " I think I have a misconception about the idea of living life in the present.  I always thought that it meant to stop worrying about the future and to just be in the moment.  But now I realize that it doesn’t mean to forget about the future, but to start living for the future, and to enjoy the present moment as if it was your future, and that whatever you do in the present moment, is something you’ll have to live with in the future.\n\nFor example, if you spend time procrastinating and playing video games, that’s what your future will basically be composed of, and you’ll have to live with that decision of wasting your time, and you won’t be happy with yourself, if you have ambitions that you want to achieve.  Another example is, if you are in a relationship, and your partner wants to take things to the next level, and you’re not on the same page, thinking about living in the present, would mean that you think about the consequences of your decision of not being ready to take things to the next level, and what that would mean for your relationship in the long term, and if you’re cool with that, then stay in the present, and if you’re not, then you should do what is best for both you and your partner, and break it off before both of you get more attached. \n\nLiving life in the present, is not about stopping to worry about the future, it’s about planning and doing whatever you can in the present moment, in order to have a good future, and to not have regrets or negative consequences in the future, and if you adopt this mindset, then you’ll be able to truly live life in the present, and not have to worry about missing out on the present because you’re too worried about the future, since you’ll be ready for the future, and will know no fear.",

Everyone developing games these days using \"smart\" rumble, which is cool and all, but like... 20% of the rumble controllers seem to actually work with it?\n\nAnd, in general, what is up with rumble?  Why did it never take off?  Why do some controllers not have it at all?  How difficult would it be to implement vibration and put it in every controller?  Why are there still controllers being made without it?\n\nI know Nintendo switched to \"HD rumble\" which supposedly the Switch's controllers do a better job at simulating forces and stuff, but it seems like every other console since the Xbox360/PS3 has had the same exact rumbles as each other, and they're all pretty much the same as the ones that were in the GameCube and original Xbox.\n\nThough, to be fair, the Switch's rumble is pretty bad too...

    " The former officer, Derek Chauvin, pleaded not guilty Tuesday during his arraignment on murder and other charges in the death of George Floyd, who prosecutors say was pinned to the pavement with a knee on his neck for what prosecutors said was 9 1/2 minutes.\n\nKyle previously said he would \"probably\" attend the trial, but he took to Instagram stories to detail why he won't be covering the trial:\n\n\"A lot of people are asking me about the Derek Chauvin trial, and yeah, I've been following it. And there's been a lot of speculation, and for good reason, about whether or not I would be covering it.

    " Engage with literature beyond school. Read books of different genres and topics on your own time. It's easy to lose interest in something if it becomes something you're forced to do. Read books by authors of different backgrounds, books in different languages, short stories, long form fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. \nIf you have the time and energy I would also recommend writing your own stories. Create something entirely your own. This fluctuates a lot for me where sometimes I'm super interested in writing and then other times I don't feel like doing it at all and that's okay.

But doing this helped me regain interest and passion for literature when I was feeling a bit burned out. \nAlso following book accounts on instagram or goodreads where you can constantly see books and read short summaries might help reignite your passion.",
    " I love the idea of a fresh start. However, exclusively the top tier guns and loadouts are the most powerful (Grapple FTW). Earlier in the wipe you could rock a plain pistol or an mp5 and have a chance at fighting back, but now? You get dunked on non-stop. It's frustrating being melted by weapons you can't even see until they are right in your face. Not only that, but with the addition of tacticals, you can't even play stealthy anymore. Regardless of whether I run around like an alarmed ostrich with my ears turned up, or crouch and tap my mic to spoof a headset, gettingShotInTheDuckingFuckingAss with a shotgun through a wall is inevitable. I've heard people say that \"new players should just grind, and not focus on power\". That doesn't cut it when every other player is a god-tier hitscan shotcaster with aimbot ears and an orbital laser. I'm not saying I want to run around sniping people left and right with a bullpup, but it would be nice to not get melted by stuff I can't see, that shoots faster than I can react. This is coming from a guy that has been playing day one, and has gotten a few scratches in during the occasional lucky shotgun blast. God help the people that haven't played in a year, or are brand new. It's not even fun playing anymore. The thrill of getting a good loadout, thinking you have a chance, and then dying in two seconds is just frustrating, not entertaining. Again, love the idea of fresh starts and all, but it's not fun when everyone is wearing Titanfall underwear under their loadout.",

    " I hear this a lot, and there are some great explanations out there, but I still don't think I understand this issue entirely. Why is tapering seen as the only possible solution?\n\nTo explain why I am confused, let's look at the following scenario:\n\nSo, Japan has had ZIRP for about 15 years now, and they do not seem to have inflation (yet). Why is it that when we in the US talk about keeping interest rates low for a long time, we immediately jump to the conclusion that we need to taper, when Japan has had a similar policy for nearly twice as long, and they didn't taper?\n\nIsn't the solution somehow more complex than \"taper\"? Or is Japan doing something else to combat the effects of ZIRP that they don't want to tell us? Do we not have enough intellectual flexibility to consider alternative solutions that still involve CRP/ZIRP, but may involve different tools?\n\nIn my admittedly limited understanding, the benefits of CRP/ZIRP are twofold:\n\n1. In the event of another financial crisis, interest rates will already be at zero, so we will have more tools available to fight a recession. And yes, this is somewhat preemptive, but that's not so bad, is it?\n\n2. Low rates encourage more investment into ventures that otherwise may not have been feasible. Many of these ventures will create jobs, and the increased business activity will stimulate the economy.\n\nNow, if we taper, then we lose the second point, and the only thing we really retain is the preemptive measure of being able to fight another recession. But, since we can't permanently keep interest rates at zero (because of point 1), we will eventually want to raise rates high enough to be able to lower them in the event of another recession. So it seems that there are only two options:\n\n1. Raise rates now, and accept that we will have less tools available in the next recession.\n\n2. Don't raise rates, and accept that we may have inflation later on, but that we will be more prepared for the next recession.\n\nSo, why is it that option 2 is considered unacceptable? Both options have their pros and cons, so why is it that we instantly jump to \"taper\" as though it were the only possible solution?\n\nWhat am I missing here?",
    " There are a lot of factors here and everyone will have an opinion, but from my understanding, you can resign without it being held against you (ie non-renewal isn't tied to your resignation).\n\nYour situation, and whether or not you want to leave, is something you should be discussing with your administration - not other teachers on social media. Do you have a good working relationship with your admin? If you do, then talk to them about what you're hoping to do. If you have an adversarial relationship with them, I wouldn't bother because they'll just think you're trying to get them back for something - pure speculation on my part, but I wouldn't put it past admin to think that. If you don't have a good relationship with your admin, start making one. It will serve you well in the future whether it's at this school or not.\n\nI resigned from my last district to move back home. When I told my admin, they were surprisingly supportive and offered to help me with my resume and recommendations. I listed my reasons for leaving as 'personal reasons' and that was that. I had wonderful evaluations and they were sad to see me go, but they didn't try to talk me out of it or anything. The district was also incredibly pro-teacher and even though they weren't obligated to, they gave me a wonderful recommendation when I began looking for a new job.\n\nWhen I interviewed, I openly discussed why I left and was very honest. I mentioned the supportive environment, competitive pay and benefits, and the reason I left - wanting to move closer to family. The district I'm in now loved that I was honest, and that I had such a good working relationship with my previous admin. These things are all important to school districts - at least the effective ones.\n\nIf you don't want to disclose your reasons for leaving, you don't have to. No employer can force you to disclose that information. You can simply state that you are leaving for 'personal reasons' and leave it at that. Again, this is something you should be discussing with your admin - not other teachers on social media. Good luck! Hope it works out for you.",

    " I work at an arcade and one of the games occasionally has a minor issue where it will not release a prize that a customer has won. Obviously, whenever this happens, management is always very quick to respond and fix the issue so we can award the customer with their rightfully won prize. \n\nWell, yesterday a man who was likely in his forties became irate after the machine malfunctioned and didn't release the prize he felt he had won. Keep in mind, this is after he already exchanged his prize (a stuffed animal) for 3 different $5 dollar bills. Apparently, this man really wanted the stuffed animal and felt he was owed one free of charge after exchanging his initial prize. \n\nAfter explaining to the man that we would need to step away from the machine for a moment so it could be serviced and the prize could be awarded, he flew into a rage. He began yelling that he wanted his free stuffed animal, that we were trying to steal from him, and that he wanted to speak to a manager. All while gesturing towards the somewhat annoyed crowd of onlookers gathering behind him. \n\nAt this point, it should be noted that we have a camera system set up in the arcade that is very clearly labeled with signs in plain sight. These cameras monitor the floor for safety purposes, but they also can be used to review any disputes that may arise. \n\nAfter telling the man for a second time that we would repair the game and award him his prize if he stepped away from the machine, he replied \"I know you're watching, so in case you weren't able to tell, I would like a free stuffed animal. You can look back on this recording and see that I was in my right to receive this prize.\" \n\nHe then proceeded to tap at the glass partition separating the prize area from where the prizes are stored, demanding that we come to the other side and award his \"owed\" prize. Keep in mind, this is all happening on a busy Saturday afternoon with dozens of families and children present. \n\nAfter 10 minutes of this man screaming obscenities and threats to get the \"last\" stuffed animal he wanted, his attention finally shifted to another employee and I was able to sneak the prize he originally won back into the machine. \n\nI can't imagine how it must have felt to be a child watching this interaction between a customer and an employee. This man essentially bullied his way into getting what he wanted, all while ensuring the other customers and I were fully aware of",

    " I worked retail for 4 years throughout high school and college, and lordy do I have some stories. There are so many awkward customers.\n\nThere was the lady who needed help finding outfits for her exotic dancer daughter. There was the octogenarian who came in to buy a rifle and bullets on Christmas Eve. There was the lady who yelled at me for 10 minutes because I wouldn't sell her a 4-foot tall ceramic statue of Buddha. (We don't sell that stuff, lady. Not your Buddha, not your Buddha at all!)\n\nBut the absolute worst were the people who would literally walk into the store, look directly at me (not 4 feet away), and then just stand there. Without saying anything. They'd just stare at me with this dumb look on their face. It was incredibly awkward. After about 30 seconds of this, I'd say hi or ask if I could help them find something. And then they'd say something like \"uh yeah, where are your bath rugs?\" or \"do you have any fitted sheets?\"\n\nHonestly if you're struggling with conversation, retail is a good place to learn.

    " I just wanted to say that the education system in Turkey is literally an examination by God. There is a saying that goes like \"God conducts the examination, human being is just the scribe\". This is a very poisonous saying if you ask me. Because it is implying that you are not responsible for whatever grade you get, God is. So students don't try hard, they don't go to extra lessons, they don't do their homework, because \"God will have mercy on me, I will pass anyway\". However, when the grade comes out, they don't think that it is their own fault they failed, they think that \"God was just being mean, I didn't deserve this\". Something similar happens when a student decides to \"pray for a good grade\", they don't work hard, they pray and when they don't get the grade they want, they think that God was \"being unjust\", and not themselves for not studying. This mentality is doing nothing but making people excuse themselves from taking responsibility for their own actions, it is destroying the society.",

    " I'm 17 and I've always been pretty boyish, but recently my dysphoria has been getting a lot worse. Like, worse than it already was anyways. Every day I get more and more depressed and hate myself more. I just want to be cute and wear cute clothes but that's so hard when you look like a 12 year old boy. I feel like my dysphoria will never go away and Im just going to get uglier and more uncomfortable in my skin as I get older. It's hard to be motivated to do anything when I feel this way about myself. Is this just my depression getting the best of me, or could my dysphoria potentially get worse as I get older? Cause it really scares me. Idk if this is just a phase or hormones or what, but I'm seriously terrified. It just feels so hopeless.",
    " I've been taking modafinil (brand name: Provigil) for about three months now, and it's done wonders for my productivity. I've always been a bit of a night owl, but modafinil has helped me become more of a morning person, and has made it easier for me to wake up early and get things done. It's also helped me focus better, and has made me more efficient at getting things done.\n\nThe only side effect I've experienced has been some mild headaches, but they've been infrequent and easily manageable. I've also found that modafinil can cause some anxiety, but again, it's been mild and infrequent.\n\nOverall, I've been really happy with modafinil, and I plan to continue taking it. It's made a big difference in my productivity and has helped me become more of a morning person. It's a great tool for anyone who wants to improve their focus and mental clarity.",

    " I was a junior in high school, it was lunchtime, and I was walking down the hallway to my next class. There was a guy maybe 10 feet in front of me, and he turns around and starts going the other way. We literally almost collide, but I manage to stop myself short of running into him. However, the guy behind me was not so lucky, and NAILED the other guy at full speed. They both went down in a heap on the ground, and I hardly had time to register what had happened when I heard the guy getting up and sprinting away. He presumably didn't want to get in trouble for bullying, as it was pretty obvious that he had pushed the other guy intentionally. Meanwhile, the other guy is still on the ground, and NOT getting up. As I'm watching all this happen, it suddenly occurs to me that THIS IS WHY I LEARNED TO DANCE. I immediately drop down into a split next to him, take his hands, and start doing the \"sprinkler.\" Suddenly, girls who previously had nothing to do with me are screaming THEIR names, taking pictures, and offering me lunch the next day. Sadly, the other guy got up and immediately left, so I never got to show OFF for him. Still, lessons learned. Always be prepared for a dance-off, and always assume that there's a reason you learned something.",

I don’t know, anytime someone compliments me on it I get kind of embarrassed and uncomfortable lmao. It makes me feel awkward tbh. I know it’s irrational, but why do I feel this way? Is it just because it’s not a common combo or am I doing something weird with my hair? Idk man.

It's kind of hard explaining why you don't want to live anymore without sounding selfish or rude, because the people closest to you (the people who you'd do this to) are the people who'd do anything to make you happy. lie to themselves that you're okay. I don't want to put anyone through that though. I'm in a somewhat okay spot, and I think that this was more of a \"test the waters\" sort of thing, to see what it would be like, and I don't think I'd do it again. Not that I'm afraid of it, but because it wouldn't accomplish anything. But, now that I've done it, I can say from experience that it doesn't \"fix\" things. It's not like you can suddenly see everything in a new light, and realize that everything's going to be okay, and that you were just being a whiny little bitch. It just kind of.. doesn't do anything. I guess I felt like I needed to get that out. I'm not trying to get attention or anything, and I sincerely hope that no one tries this because it's not a magical fix-all. It's just.. exhausting.

They didn't kill him! He's alive!\"\n\nThis is a fun idea, right?\n\nAlso the line \"Yes sir, Mr. Farrow\" could be cool if they updated the voice used for CLU to resemble the voice from the original TRON more closely. Not that I wouldn't want to hear an updated \"I know kinesics\" delivered in the old V.O. style. That would be awesome.",

Thing is, aside from the swollen lymph nodes that led me to get checked in the first place, I don’t really feel any symptoms. I’m not tired, I don’t feel pain, I’m not even particularly anxious or scared about it, at least not in an everyday basis. I know that it’s a serious thing and I should be taking it more seriously, but... I just don’t feel anything. I feel like I’m just going through the motions and waiting for the treatments to start so I can get it over with.

I know that it must sound terrible, especially from someone who got told they have cancer, but... I just don’t feel anything about it, good or bad. I’m not denying it, I know it’s there, I just don’t feel anything about it.\n\nI should also add that I have a pretty stressful job, so the fact that I don’t feel particularly stressed about this maybe because my body is already used to dealing with high levels of stress, who knows.\n\nI know this sub is mostly for asking advice, and I don’t really need any.

    " I'm a union operating engineer in the Midwest and make really good money for my area relative to cost of living. Have a pension and retiree health care. Well paid vacation and sick time that accumulates and rolls over. 14 paid holidays a year. Every other Friday off. Good medical and dental insurance. Basically unheard of nowadays for a blue-collar job. I feel lucky and want to retire from this line of work with my benefits intact.\n\nHowever, over the last few years, I've watched a few things that are just accepted as normal, and it's baffling to me why nobody talks about it. The amount of waste on jobs is insane. Nobody cares about efficiency. Why not use a skid steer to do that excavation when you just have a couple holes to dig? Why not clean up the job at the end of every day so you don't have to pay a man 8 hours to clean up the garbage? Why do we order materials with no regard for how much we actually need? Why not just order enough for the job instead of 30 extra just in case? Why not schedule jobs efficiently so you aren't driving an hour to do a 1-hour job?\n\nAnd nobody is held accountable for any of this. Why does the job always have to be \"right now\" and \"as soon as possible\"? Why are the most unnecessary things always the highest priority? Why are so many decisions made by people with no skin in the game or any concept of cost? Why does every job have to be a masterpiece instead of just getting the basics done so you can move on?\n\nI can't retire soon enough. This job would be really great if it wasn't for the complete lack of regard for wasting money and resources. Nobody has talked to me about this because they all assume it's normal.",

    " It's been a long time since I've been confident with my body. I've always been overweight but when I was younger (into my early 20s) I just accepted it and lived my life. I knew I was intelligent, and witty, and I had a good career, and promising life ahead of me. That's when I was happiest with myself and my body. Now I'm size 24/26, and 360 lbs. BMI is over 40, clinical depression and anxiety, inactive, and just downright miserable. I've always known my weight was a problem but it's different when objectively you're morbidly obese. When I was younger I could lose weight, but now it's 10x harder. I've tried losing weight so many times it's not even funny. I can restrict for a few weeks but then I indulge a little, then a little more, then I'm restricting again and the cycle continues. Clearly my mentality around food is unhealthy. I've tried exercise, but that's a whole other monster I have yet to conquer. It's so hard to start, and the few times I have started I quickly give up when I don't see the results I want as fast as I want. And pregnancy was HELL. I was 400 lbs pregnant. Just terrible. I want to be happy again. I don't even know where to start anymore. I'm so tired either way. Tired of being obese and tired of trying and failing. It's hard to explain the mental anguish and loneliness being this overweight causes. Not to mention the physical pain. I'm just so tired.",

    " I'm looking to upgrade internet for our household as the current DSL line is extremely slow and unreliable (6-800ms ping, 1.5-2.2mbps down, 200kbps up), and was looking to upgrade to fibre. \n\nOur current ISP is Telus, who offers a 300mbps down/300mbps up package for $85/month for 2 years, and subsequently $105/month. The next package offering is 1000mbps down/500mbps up for $105/month for 2 years, and subsequently $120/month. Neither of these packages have data caps. Telus also offers a bundle package with HD TV and home phone for $10 more per month, but I don't think we'd make use of that.\n\nOne of my coworkers recently switched to Shaw, and was telling me about their deals. Apparently they're offering a 1000mbps down/1000mbps up package for $80/month for 2 years, and subsequently $100/month. The fine print says that this price is based on a 2-year price guarantee, and that after the two years is up, most customers will receive an average annual increase of approximately 5%. It also states that the regular rate for this package is $159.99/month. This package also has no data caps.\n\nWhich of these options would be better? Trying to determine if the initial savings of going with Shaw is worth it for the increased cost after 2 years, or if we're better off going with Telus' higher speed package to begin with. \n\nI believe that Telus recently started allowing customers to purchase top-ups for additional data, up to a maximum of 1tb. Shaw offers the same, but only up to a maximum of 250gb. Not sure if this would affect our decision making. The household consists of 2 adults and 2 teenagers, and while one of the teenagers does heavy gaming and 4k streaming, the other one does moderate gaming and streaming, and the adults do some moderate-heavy streaming and zoom calls. None of us really download large files very often. \n\nI appreciate any advice you can give! Thanks!",

They had signs with graphically horrifying pictures of what appeared to be covid victims. I drove by initially thinking it was a protest but then saw the signs and took another look. I almost wished I didn't. It was horrifying. They were yelling things at people who were waiting in their cars, and people were getting out and screaming back things like \"you're killing people\".

    " I own a successful business in a small rural town in northeastern Vermont. Our business is growing and becoming more successful each year, and attracting new residents to the area.\n\nUnfortunately, our town's only industry is forestry, which in 2020 accounted for only 30% of the town's GDP. This means that 70% of our town's energy consumption comes from non-renewable sources. The cost of electricity is 21 cents per kilowatt-hour, and heating costs for businesses like mine are incredibly high -- about 44% higher than the national average. This is not sustainable or tenable in the long term.\n\nWith this in mind, my colleagues and I started to look at other industries that are more sustainable, and have decided that cannabis is among the most promising. There is an established market for cannabis here, as evidenced by the number of registered patients in the state. However, there is a significant shortage of cannabis in the state, and we believe that our town could benefit from increased supply to meet demand.\n\nThe problem is that our town is currently lacking the infrastructure to support the cannabis industry. Although our town has a population of just under 10,000 people, it has nowhere to purchase cannabis for medical use. While there is a dispensary about an hour away, the majority of our town's residents cannot afford the travel costs to get there.\n\nWe believe that the town's residents would benefit from a dispensary, and that it would stimulate business in the town while providing patients with easier access to medical cannabis. In addition, we think that a dispensary could be a stepping stone to creating a sustainable, profitable cannabis industry in our town.\n\nThe question, then, is how to go about establishing this infrastructure. Despite the success of our business, we do not have the capital required to open a dispensary. In addition, although we are confident that there would be demand for a dispensary in our town, we are unsure of the exact steps that would be required to make it a reality.\n\nMy colleagues and I would be very grateful for any advice or guidance that experienced entrepreneurs in the cannabis industry could provide. How do we go about raising capital for a dispensary? What sort of permits and licenses would we need? Any advice or guidance on how to move forward with this project would be most appreciated!",

    " \"Aphelios is a comparatively small champion when it comes to figure height, however when it comes to abilities and damage output he is a monster. simplest way i found to describe him is as a high risk high reward champion with a rapidly changing toolkit that adapts to your teams compositions and the enemies you face, along with great base damages and scaling.\n\nAphelios is a relatively new champion in league of legends, releasing shortly after the rift revelries event in 2020. classed as an ADCsitter sup hybrid, Aphelios has one of the best  accuracies for an ADC due to his four guns. he is considered a hyper carry due to his team fighting and objective taking ability, as well as his incredibly high damage output.\n\nwhen playing aphelios it is important to know his abilities as well as ideal item builds for the champion, along with the playstyle that is expected when playing as him.\n\nAbility Summaries:\n1. His first ability is a directed, long range shotgun blast. Killing minions decreases the cooldown.\n2. His second is a targeted rocket blast, that hits the first target for full damage and creates a field that does damage over time to other enemies in the area of effect.\n3. His third is a point and click field creation, that creates a field that does damage over time to enemies who stay inside it. this field also provides sight in a large radius.\n4. His fourth is a self targeted dash that allows him to dash in the targeted direction, this also allows him to go through units and terrain making him extremely mobile.\n5. His fifth and final ability for his base kit is a targeted bombardment, that when targeting a champion will prioritize that target and bombard them with gunfire reducing their protection and magic resistance.\n\nWhen playing Aphelios ideally you want to buy a rifle alongside your mythic item, as your mythic will more than likely be soul vessel. after these items you want to complete your core build which is guardian angle and boomerang. after these it is best to finish off the build with a death cap for the full damage output.\n\nWhen playing as aphelios you want to be as aggressive as possible in lane as his kit is very strong in lane and he has extremely high base damages and ad scaling, allowing you to dominate your lane opponent. when in team fights you want to be near the front line as you are very burst damage oriented, allowing you to delete",

I mean, sure, I talked about it with my wife and we decided together that it was a good idea. But still, it's a lot of money to gamble with. I just hope that in the end it works out and we can pay off our debt and get back on our feet.\n\nI'm gonna go distract myself with some TV or something. Maybe I'll watch that new show everyone's talking about. Yeah, I could use a little mindless entertainment right about now.",
    " I took optional graduation mathematics paper during my undergraduate as I felt nervous about the economics graduation. It went fairly well and I used it to calculate odds of being able to graduate in economics. \n\nI graduated with a 13.5 (out of 20) average in economics courses (first and second years, maths and management flavoured). In the last year, I did all the economics courses (including honours courses) with an average of about 15.5-16 thus far. Had some bad luck and a couple of stupid mistakes (plus a terrible midterm for one course) brought down my average in those courses. Results for the last few courses aren't out yet but I'm pretty confident about a couple and pretty nervous about a couple. Also, took 6 non-economics courses in the third year so that contributed to the boost in average as well. \n\nThere was another guy who graduated in my year, with a 11.5 average (out of 20) in economics courses in the first two years. He had a 16 average in the economics courses in the third year (including honours) and graduated. So that means preferably I want a 12 average in first and second year (I can afford to drop a couple now that I know the syllabus and my mistakes were more due to nervousness and some bad luck). Plus, a 15 average in the third year economics courses. That should give me a good shot at graduating with honours in economics. \n\nThoughts? I know it's a lot of ifs but thinking aloud.",
    " I main pyro, and in my experience, if you land your shots consistently you'll almost always get kills easily. The problem is when you play against good dodge players like heavy, demo, or soldier. It becomes extremely difficult to land your shots because of their dodge abilites. Another thing is that the pyro's air blast can be easily dodged if you have good movement (jumping around a lot). Other than that the pyro is definitely not weak. His \"weakness\" is more on the player's skill than the actual character. It is more difficult to play pyro compared to demo or heavy because of how fast pyro is and how quickly he can kill himself with his flare gun or secondary. infested turf is also a hard map to play pyro because of how open it is and how small your flamethrower hitbox is compared to other maps. honestly the only thing i would change about pyro is make his air blast not reflect projectiles and instead stun the opponent like a concussive bomb does. And make it so that if you reflect a rocket or grenade that it doesn't take a long time to come back to you, because if the other team sees that you've reflected their grenade they just shoot you with a rocket before the grenade gets to you.",
    " I'm 6 weeks pregnant and was told everything looks good for now but I've had really bad cramping on and off since about week 3.

Sunday I felt like I was having bad period cramps but they went away fairly quickly. Since then no cramping just lots of pressure. I've also been having lots of vaginal discharge, should I be concerned? This is my first pregnancy. Is this normal? How long does it last? Should I be calling my dr?

    " The title of the post is \"Funded PhD programs in the US are a myth?\". The text of the post reads as follows:\n\nthumbnailUrlemore alike\n\nI am perplexed. A while ago, somebody posted a similar question on this sub (can't find it now, sorry!). Some people replied that PhDs in the US are usually funded, and those that are not, are an indication of a bad program or dean.\n\nNow, I am a prospective PhD student in CS, and I have been short-listed for Texas A&M University and University of Wisconsin-Madison. Both programs asked for admission records, 2 letters of recommendation, and NO FINANCIAL SUPPORT DOCUMENTS (no bank statements, no tax returns, nothing). In fact, on the application forms, they have fields for \" Lua annual self-funded amount\" and \"External funding\".\n\nEDIT: The fields were indeed for \"Expected annual self-funded amount\"\n\nBoth programs are top-ranked and well-known in the US and internationally. Hence, my question is: how can they possibly admit me without looking at my finances? Do they offer full funding to all admitted students? Is this the norm in the US? If yes, why do they ask for \"expected annual self-funded amount\"? Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks!\n\nEDIT: I found another question that might be useful for people in a similar situation. It seems like it is customary to email the professor you are interested in working with, and ask about funding opportunities.\n\nI am indeed interested in working with specific professors, but both programs have a \"general\" application email for inquiries.\n\nAgain, sorry if this question is redundant. I tried to search for it but couldn't find it. Would appreciate it if someone could link the original question if it indeed exists. Thanks!",
    " There seems to be a never-ending debate on the extent of Wolverine's healing factor. How fast does it heal? Do mutations stack? Is his bone laced with an adamantium analog?\n\nFirst, let's establish the points that everyone seems to agree on.\n\nHis healing factor allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with a speed far greater than any natural organism and comparable to many supernatural beings.\nHis healing factor allows him to overcome any disease, regardless of how lethal it may be to humans.\nHis healing factor provides him immunity to most (if not all) drugs and toxins regardless of dosage. Many of these would simply be metabolized and expelled from his body immediately.\n\nNow, let's examine the claims that people seem to dispute:\n\nThere seems to be a split on whether his healing factor allows him to regenerate lost limbs or not. I've seen people claim that it does and people claim that it doesn't.\n\nThere seems to be a split on whether his healing factor allows him to regenerate without limitation. I've seen people claim that it does and people claim that it doesn't and that the bad guys just haven't figured out how to hurt him yet.\n\nNow, for my own personal take on it (because I think we all know that's what you're here for).\n\nI think Wolverine's healing factor regenerates lost limbs provided they are still partially attached and he has sufficient blood flow to the detached portion. Examples would be Tiger Claws ripping his arm off at the shoulder or Lady Deathstrike nearly severing his right arm. In both cases, the limb was still partially attached and he was able to regrow it. In the case of his hand being blown off by the Hand, it was completely detached and far away from his body. I do not believe his healing factor regenerated his hand in this case.\n\nFor his healing factor's limitations, I believe it has unlimited potential but is limited by the speed at which his body can regenerate. I believe that there is a threshold of trauma beyond which his body cannot regenerate quickly enough to save him from death (perhaps a combination of the severity of the wound and the time it takes his body to regenerate). An example of this is the atomic bomb. I do not believe his healing factor could possibly keep up with the amount of trauma inflicted on his body by an atomic bomb. Another example could be if he was decapitated. His body can obviously regenerate a lost head but I do not believe it could do so",
    " In an early scene of Martin Scorsese's 3-D children's film \"Hugo,\" an orphan boy named Hugo (Asa Butterfield) gets trapped inside the clock tower of a Paris train station, and the camera pans around him in a dizzying display of techno-wizardry. It's hard not to think of another Martin Scorsese movie, \"Taxi Driver,\" in which a character describes the nausea induced by riding a fairground carousel. Fairgrounds and circuses are places of both wonder and nausea, of illusion and reality, and Scorsese uses the 3-D here to explore those contradictions, to plunge us into the depths of Hugo's world and also to keep us at a distance from it. It's an appropriate choice, given the story's origins in a book by Brian Selznick (\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\"), which itself combines photographs and illustrations.\n\nThe story begins in a train station, where Hugo lives behind the walls with his faithful canine companion, Scorsese's camera swooping over the gears and wheels of a giant clock before landing on the boy's anxious face. The film then jumps back in time to tell Hugo's story, which begins in a dying town where he lives with his father (Jude Law), who repairs clocks. When his father is murdered by a mysterious man and presumably dies himself, Hugo escapes to the city, where he lives in the walls of the train station, stealing apples and avoiding the station inspector (Ray Winstone). Eventually, he is caught and nearly sent to an orphanage, but he manages to escape with the help of an eccentric toy shop owner named Georges (Ben Kingsley), whose goddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) has a curious connection to Hugo's past.\n\nIt's a complex plot, and Scorsese directs with his usual fluency, shifting between past and present and moving his camera with infectious joy. The 3-D effect is sometimes subtle, sometimes showy, but it's always integrated into the storytelling. (It's never used to throw things at the camera, a relief.) The early scenes between Hugo and Isabelle are charming, and the movie is at its best when it sticks to the story of the two lonely children and the mysterious past they share. The story's solution to the mystery of Hugo's father's death is a letdown, however, relying on a deus ex machina and a conveniently placed notebook.\n\nBut the movie's true pleasures are more modest, including",
    " While the fighting in \"Never Back Down\" is gritty and brutal, the message is empowering. A depressed teenager suddenly develops self-esteem when he discovers MMA. The idea for the script is clever. The message is straightforward and arrives in the first scene: a bullied kid suffers constant abuse from classmates, then goes home to an abusive father. After the dad nearly strangles him, the son breaks free and tells him, \"You'll never lay a hand on me again.\" Then he moves in with his aunt. There's nothing subtle about the message; it's not meant to be. This is a story about a kid standing up for himself. \n\nThe fight scenes are realistically brutal. They're also well-choreographed and don't look fake. As the protagonist gains confidence, the fights get more intense and brutal. An early bout against a bully is a short one. The antagonist wins easily. Then our hero gets trained by a grizzled, quasi-mystic MMA fighter who \"sees\" the kid has \"heart.\" Heart is the most important attribute for a fighter. The trainer is a compelling character: He delivers his lines with understated deadpan, then kicks ass in the ring. \n\nThe protagonist gets good enough to compete in a MMA tournament. His first bout is against a scared opponent who takes a brutal beating. Then he faces a highly-regarded local fighter who nearly kills him. It's a great fight. The finale is against the bully who started it all. The fight is intense, and the message is clear: stand up for yourself. You'll never back down.",

The story was slightly predictable and there were a few things that didn't make sense (like the garage sale with the baseball cards?) but it was entertaining for the most part. I especially liked the scenes in which Danny was getting closer to his son. Those were the best parts of the movie.

    " Hardball is a 2001 movie starring Keanu Reeves. It is a film about a convict who is released from prison to coach a team of inner-city kids in the game of baseball. It is a remarkable story of redemption and second chances. Not only does Keanu Reeves give a great performance, but the baseball action is thrilling. Although the story is a bit predictable, Hardball is still a very enjoyable film.\n\nThe movie captures the importance of teamwork, commitment, and friendship. It is a movie that the whole family can enjoy together. Although it is a bit on the sentimental side, the movie is well-made and entertaining. It is a film that will make you laugh and cry. It is a great film about the power of second chances and the importance of giving people a chance to prove themselves. Highly recommended!",
    " Giving this a boost up from 1 1/2 stars to 2 stars. Why? Because I caught myself smiling, tapping my feet, and appreciating the dance numbers–and that's about all this vapid but innocuous film aiming low and hitting its target asks of its audience.\n\nIt's astonishing to me that a film could be made in 2008 about people who appear to have no connection to any current cultural, social, or technological developments yet still be released by a major studio. That's borderline charming in and of itself. Any movie that manages to make the mainstream despite an apparent complete unawareness of the current year (and, apparently, many of the preceding years), deserves a certain amount of respect.\n\nBut it's harder to admire the film's complete lack of ambition. Step Up is a story about a young man who wants to become a professional dancer but can't because he lives in a place where that's not possible, and a young woman who seems to have everything but is similarly thwarted by her background and circumstances. Their solution? Throw a party on a roof top and dance the night away, hoping that someone important will be impressed. It's like if Billy Elliott decided to become a dancer by throwing a rave in an abandoned mine and hoping the DJ notices him.\n\nThe problem is that stories like this demand a certain amount of world-building in order to make their simple plots work–ambition has to be tempered with a more realistic outlook on life, and characters who are inherently self-interested have to do things that are a bit more subtle in order to achieve their goals. Compare this to something like Fame, which managed to make a more effective and inspiring story about aspiring performers despite being made in 1980. The difference is in the details–Fame didn't just throw its characters on stage and hope that was enough, it showed them struggling to make it there.\n\nBut Step Up doesn't concern itself with details–its characters are paper thin, its story is paint-by-numbers, and its ending is inevitable. And yet.. the dance numbers are surprisingly well-choreographed and entertaining. I found myself tapping my feet along with several of the songs, and even though the \"story\" was trying my patience at times I was still somewhat entertained by the time the end credits rolled.\n\nI don't know. This is the kind of film I would have dismissed out of hand a few years ago, but–like I said–I found myself enjoying it far more than I expected to",

The scene where he starts dancing in the bar is straight out of the comics, but the way they weave it into the story feels natural and not at all forced.\n\nSome of the scenes are a little bit confusing, and the ending doesn't really provide any closure.

    " 'Grindhouse' is loads of fun. Split into two movies (because one film was not enough), the menu divides the movies as 'Planet Terror' and 'Death Proof'. 'Planet Terror' is a kick-ass zombie movie. Rose McGowan is mind-blowing as the heartbroken bride. This gives a whole new meaning to the phrase \"crazy ex-girlfriend\". Plus, you have to see the special feature on this disc where they talk about how they made the effects. It's totally worth the price of the disc. 'Death Proof' is a bit slow at times but overall it's a great disc. The transfer is beautiful and the sound is awesome. There's a making-of documentary on the disc for 'Death Proof' that is really interesting. They had a really small budget but they did a great job. It's awesome that they used a real car instead of a fake one. That's the kind of stuff that makes indie films great. Plus, you gotta love that hard-core couch potato!",
    " While this sequel to the unexpected hit of 1996 has more of everything that made the original so much fun, it still doesn't have enough to really qualify as a great film. The story picks up some time after the first film left off, with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team from the IMF (Impossible Missions Force) given a \"mission\": to track down a deadly, but very useful, bioweapon called \"Chimera\", which has fallen into the hands of a rogue IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (John Woo). Throughout the course of the film, Hunt and his team (which includes old favorites like Ving Rhames and new members like Canadian flyboy Billy Robinson) must not only track down Ambrose, but also deal with a female assassin known as \"The Prophet\" (Kristin Scott Thomas), who has her own plans for Chimera.\n\nThe plot is nothing special, but the execution is what makes this film work. The action sequences are even more outrageous than before, with the first half hour being a nearly nonstop assault on the senses as Hunt and his team board a heavily-armed train in Russia in order to retrieve the Chimera canisters. The film's biggest set piece comes towards the end, when Hunt must confront Ambrose and The Prophet on the rooftop of a partly-constructed building (this sequence was shot in a single take, which adds to the enjoyment of it). The film also features a fun cameo by couture-clad legend Catherine Deneuve.\n\nThe cast is good across the board. Tom Cruise seems to be having an even better time this time around, and his chemistry with Michelle Monaghan (as Hunt's girlfriend) is excellent. Jonathan Rhys-Davies returns briefly as Fallout, and is given considerably more to do this time around (including a funny scene where he squares off against Rhames). John Woo also appears as Ambrose, and does a good job of playing the role as a sort of \"IMF version\" of himself. But the prize for \"best performance\" goes to Kristin Scott Thomas, who manages to make The Prophet a compelling character despite being given virtually nothing to work with.\n\nThis is the type of mindless, \"popcorn movie\" that Hollywood does best, and while it's no \"Casablanca\", it's the type of film that it's almost impossible not to enjoy.",
    " Vanilla Sky is one of the most disappointing experiences of my life. I usually avoid reading or listening to any reviews of movies that I'm about to see, but in this case, I wish I had because it would have saved me the price of a ticket and nearly two hours of my time. Tom Cruise portrays a shallow, self-absorbed, and creepy character who ultimately deserves all of the misery that comes his way. Cameron Diaz is even worse - she absolutely ruins what little plot the movie has. She comes across as a carbon copy of Kate Moss with none of the charm and all of the attitude. The only performance that somewhat shines is that of Jason Lee. Yet despite how talented an actor he is, he cannot salvage this sinking ship. The plot is paper-thin, and the ending doesn't even make any sense. Like many other critics have said, Philip Haas might have been a good director for this movie, but Cameron Crowe definitely wasn't. Save your time and money, unless you enjoy boring, poorly-written, and nonsensical movies.",
    " This is a long movie. And it's pretty slow for the first two hours. But damn, is the last hour and a half awesome.

One of the friends gets caught up in the gang life, and the other wants nothing to do with it. And that's basically the story. But the way it's told is what makes the movie so great.\n\nThe acting is top-notch. De Niro and Pacino are both amazing, as always. And the supporting cast is great too. The direction is also fantastic. Sergio Leone really knew how to make a movie.\n\nThe score is probably the best score I've ever heard in a movie.

    " 'Stalingrad' is probably the most grueling, visceral and graphic movie I've ever seen.\n\nThe plight of the Russian soldiers in the city and the depravity of the German soldiers trying to kill them is so well documented here. This movie is uncompromising in its portrayal of war. There are no heroes, just people doing their best to survive hell. There's no glamour, just guts, blood, tears, and carnage.\n\nThere are two lengthy scenes of hand-to-hand combat inside a building that are breathtaking. The melee fighting is so intense and relentless, you can almost feel the madness and desperation of the soldiers.\n\nThe movie is also not afraid to show the effects of war extended over months of constant fighting. Most of the soldiers, Russian or German, are worn, dirty, and unkempt. Their clothes and uniforms are ragged and torn. They are often hungry, exhausted, and scared.\n\nAll the acting is top-notch but Joseph Millson as Captain Pyotr Varyavski and Thomas Kretschmann as General Paulus are both superb.\n\nIf you are at all squeamish or if you can't take intense, graphic violence, then stay away. If you want to see one of the most brutal, honest, and gut-wrenching movies ever made about war, then watch 'Stalingrad'.\n\nA top 10 film for me.",
    " No other movie -- NO OTHER MOVIE -- has as many scenes that have riveted me, from the terrifying \"pump\" scene forward; from the terrifyingly well-made \"two mugs\" scene (with a hilarious payoff) to the stunning conclusion, in which a good man is forced to choose, for his soul, between his loyalty to the Navy and his instinct to do right by his fellow man.\n\nThis is filmmaking at its most urgently involving, and no scene is wasted. This is also actorly virtuosity at its most thrilling: Van Johnson, playing a handsome sailor with a steel core, gives a performance that is nothing short of electrifying; and Tom Tully, as the ship's doctor, has one scene in which he underplays to such a degree that you almost don't notice what a good actor he is. But you can't miss the performances of Humphrey Bogart and Van Johnson, two brilliant actors at the top of their game, working together as rivals and soul mates.\n\nAnd talk about a payoff! The court-martial scene is one of the most riveting 30 minutes in movie history, with Kenyon delivering one of the greatest speeches ever written for any movie, answering the charge that he's gone crazy with the most passionate defense of his right to sanity ever uttered. (\"Sanity? You want sanity? You want a sane captain? Is that what you want?\"\") It's a stunning speech, and the performance behind it is equally stunning. When Van Johnson shoots back with his own passionate speech, it's more than thrilling; it's one of the greatest scenes in movie history, and it's played by two actors at the top of their form.\n\nAnd the ending? It's perfect. A lesser filmmaker would have tried to tie up all the loose ends, but Lang doesn't try; he leaves it up to you to figure out what happens to each of the characters, and in what order. But the final image, of the captain returning to his ship, is one of the most haunting and hauntingly beautiful images ever committed to film; it's an image that stays with you, resonating with power and beauty, long after the movie has ended.\n\nThis is a great film, one of the greatest ever made. See it. See it again. Then see it again.\n\n(NOTE: This review was originally published in 2010)",

    " \"Edmund Kenire's performance is the sole redeeming factor in this excruciatingly bad portrayal of the Cinderella Man story. Russell Crowe looks the part, and does act with his usual bravura, but his Billy is a cartoon, a cliche, a collection of tricks borrowed from 1950's Hollywood, all teeth and twitches and greasy hair. There's not a moment of identification with this creature, nor belief that he could inspire the hundreds of men who followed him into the furnace of the boxing arena. The contrast with the brilliant Ron Howard portrayal of the same real-life character in *A Beautiful Mind* could not be more stark. From the outset we are asked to accept that Braddock is a failing boxer because of the economic climate of the times, although there is not a hint of hardship when he visits restaurants and cocktail bars several times a week and spends hundreds of dollars on clothes. When he finally does become hungry it is only so he can briefly play at being a starving pugilist before a conveniently located cornerman offers him a steak dinner. Along with Billy's rise from mediocrity to champion, the film also asks us to believe that his wife, played by Renée Zellweger, would abandon those she loves in favour of a mobster and then return to her family with no explanation. Although she performs creditably in the role, Zellweger is miscast, and her character is written as a fairy-tale princess, not the real woman who survived the Depression alongside her husband. The story itself, worthy as it may be, is not credible as portrayed here, and the writers try too hard to inject artificial notes of suspense and excitement into the proceedings. At the end, when Billy wins the title in a Cinderella finish, we are expected to burst into tears, not for him, but because we have been forced to sit through this endurance test of a film for the previous two hours.\"",
    " Surprisingly...this movie doesn't completely suck. I'm not saying it's a great movie, but it certainly doesn't deserve the almost unanimous hatred that it receives. It's evident that it was a passion project for Sergio Leone, a sort of ode to his childhood, to the people he loved and to the city he loved so much (New York). And in that regard, the movie is a success. There's something very sincere about it, and Leoni's obsession with Noodles (the character) is kinda cute and goes a long way to making the movie work. De Niro is OK, but honestly, James Woods OWNs this movie. He's terrible, but in a very fun way. Overall, the movie is too long and flawed, but I think it's more interesting than most mafia movies and has some really amazing scenes. Not great, but certainly not the trainwreck that everyone says it is.",

Mrs. Tweedy is a mean woman who treats the chickens like objects. The chickens decide to rebel against Mrs. Tweedy and escape the farm.\n\nThe movie follows the chickens as they assemble a group of roosters to help them escape. The group includes an American rooster named Chuck, who is a stuntman and artiste, and a Welsh rooster named Eddie, who is a former drill instructor. The chickens also encounter a group of mice, who are trying to escape the farm as well.\n\nThe chickens and mice work together to come up with a plan to escape. The plan involves building a rocket ship and launching themselves off the farm. The group has to deal with a number of obstacles, including a rat named Freddie and a guard dog named Max.\n\nThe movie is full of funny moments, especially involving the chickens. The chickens are all unique and have their own personalities. The voice acting is especially good, with Julia Sawalha standouts as the nervous Bunty.\n\nChicken Run is a fun and entertaining movie that is perfect for the whole family. It's a great example of a movie that is not overly complicated, but is still a lot of fun to watch. The characters are well drawn and the voice acting is top notch.

    " Schindler's List is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made.

The drama is taut, the action sequences are thrilling, and the entire film is an incredible piece of filmmaking.\n\nThere are films that are important because they tackle subjects that should not be forgotten, that should be remembered and taught to every new generation. This is one of those films. It is gripping, suspenseful, and utterly unforgettable. It is mandatory viewing, in my opinion, for anyone who considers themselves a student of film, or history, or both.\n\nSimply put, this is a film that everyone should see at least once, if not more.

Aside from a couple of derivative action set pieces, there isn't enough here to make \"The Mummy\" stand out from any other moderately entertaining summer action flick. \n\nThe film is at its best when it slows down and focuses on the relationship between its two leads. The chemistry between Cruise and Crowe is easy and often playful, and it helps to cover up the script's deficiencies. The dialogue is occasionally laughably bad, but the two actors manage to keep the film afloat during its first two acts. \n\nThe third act turns into a predictable collection of action movie cliches. The final showdown is a visually impressive set piece, but it's missing the emotional weight needed to make it truly satisfying. \n\n\"The Mummy\" is a mostly forgettable summer action flick that offers a few exciting moments but little else.",
    " AlthoughPrincess Mononoke ''''only'''' has a 68% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes, I think it''s arguably one of the best films ever created. It can be difficult to follow at times, but therein lies the beauty of it: it does not pander to the audience. It is never watered down. The characters are vivid and alive, the battles are intense, and the underlying messages are far more profound than most modern animation films aimed at adults. At its core, it is a coming-of-age story about environmentalism, and man''s role in preserving the balance of nature. Even the English version''s casting is superb. Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton, and Gillian Anderson all provide excellent voices for their respective characters. If you''re interested in animation as an art form, I would certainly recommend this film. No exaggeration: it''s one of my favorites.",
    " I'm curious how much comedic license was taken with the historical events of Stalin's death. Some of the humor seems to indicate a certain familiarity with the characters and events of the time and/or a loose interpretation of the truth, which given the subjects involved is problematic. But that's basically my only complaint. Otherwise, this film was surprisingly funny, cramming as many laugh-out-loud jokes and gags into 109 minutes as possible. Some of the humor is a bit raunchy, but most of it hits its mark. There are some truly hilarious bits and the cast obviously had a lot of fun filming this. Some reviews seem to take the film a bit too seriously, losing the forest for the trees, but if you can laugh along with the absurdity of the situation and the characters, this is easily one of the funniest films of the year. Obviously not for everyone, but for fans of the cast and British comedy, this comes highly recommended.",
    "Genre: Horror, Thriller\nDirector: Brian De Palma\nProducer: Paul Hirsch\nWriter: Lawrence D. Cohen, based on the novel by Stephen King\nStars: Sissy Spacek, John Travolta, William Katt, Piper Laurie\n\nAfter a traumatic experience at her high school prom, neglected outsider Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is shocked to discover that she has developed a strange, newfound power: she can control—and even cause—electricity. Meanwhile, her classmates plot revenge against her, after the prom incident has left one of their peers (William Katt) paralyzed. Led by a morally bankrupt religious fanatic (Piper Laurie), the classmates' harassment of Carrie gradually turns into all-out terror, and anyone else around her starts to feel their wrath, as well. \n\nThis stylishly made horror picture benefits from a strong performance by Spacek in the title role.\n\nNote: This film—based on a novel by Stephen King—was rated PG-13 upon its initial release, because of violence and shock effects. A subsequent re-release—with several scenes trimmed to avoid a 'PG' rating—was rated R. The film was re-released on videocassette in 2002, with both the 'PG-13' and 'R' versions available on separate cassettes.",
    " The Fighter is a drama directed by David O. Russell, starring Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale and Amy Adams. The story is a gritty, working-class drama about a boxer (Mark Wahlberg) who tries to make his way in the sport he's always loved. He's determined to go to the top, but his lifelong reliance on his brother (Christian Bale) both in and out of the ring has left him unprepared for the ruthless world of professional sports. The two brothers' relationship is put to the test as the older brother tries to teach the younger one how to be a man and take care of his family.\nThe movie was praised for its powerful performances and compelling story, and received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Bale. It won two awards for Bale's performance and for the film's screenplay. \n\nThe movie was rated R for language throughout and some violent content. \n\nDo you have any other questions about the movie?

    " A tough, gritty WWII actioner, showcasing solid performances, awesome battle scenes, slick editing, and brilliant cinematography. It also has a very odd, but interesting narrative structure. I really liked this film, and think that it is vastly underrated. Sure, it's depressing as hell, but it's also very educational, and has an oddly inspirational vibe to it. It's also got some really great battle scenes, and intriguing characters. Sure, the narrative structure is weird, and can be frustrating at times, but other than that, this film is great. Solid 4/5.",
    " Beside him, Regina Hall is fabulous as the assistant, and they have great chemistry. The supporting cast is solid as well. This is a fun movie, and a great one to watch with your friends. Fans of the book will enjoy seeing their favorite scenes on the big screen, and people who haven't read the book will enjoy it as a stand-alone movie. This is one instance where the movie is as good as, if not better than, the book.\n\nA lot of the reviews I agree with, however, I think some are being a bit harsh. While it is unrealistic that two unskilled individuals become pro gamblers, I don't think that it was ever intended as completely realistic. Brad and Amy are highly intelligent and quick-witted; they simply need some direction to harness their potential. The \"direction\" comes in the form of a mentor, played by Al Pacino, who does an excellent job. I think that the movie, like the book, is intended to be a fun, mindless adventure, not an accurate portrayal of gambling pros.\n\nIn summary, I think that the common criticism that the plot is overly-simplistic is valid, but I don't think it's a big enough flaw to warrant a bad review. If you go into the movie expecting Mindless Entertainment, you'll enjoy it.",
    " As cheesy as it comes, still a good movie tho. If you're in the mood for some sap then this is the movie for you. It's basically \"The Notebook\" but less dysfunctional and more innocent. Love stories with a fatal illness tend to tug at your heartstrings, especially if its a good one. This one does just that. I really liked the performance of Mandy Moore in this, she was excellent and very convincing. This movie made me cry like a baby despite knowing how it ends. If you're a person who likes happy endings, then this movie is guaranteed to make you feel warm and fuzzy all over.\n\nA word of caution, if you're not into romantic movies then this isn't for you, stay away! You've been warned :)",
    " A few years after retiring from the police, Benjamín Esposito (Gael García Bernal) gets a phone call from a colleague telling him that the man who was responsible for the death of his daughter, Sofía, has been found and is ready to leave jail. The man, Félix Mantero (Ricardo Darín), is freed because of a lack of evidence, and Benjamín is consumed by anger and the desire for revenge. He decides to kill Félix, and plans to do it in a way that won't raise any suspicions. He comes up with various plans, each more macabre than the last, and in the process becomes increasingly obsessed with the idea. At the same time, he starts a relationship with a woman named Irene (Soledad Villamil), who is aware of his plans, and encourages him to get closure with what happened to Sofía. \n\nI really liked the way this film was shot, and the story kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. The plot is interesting and well executed, and the characters are well developed. The film is in Spanish, with English subtitles, and I thought the subtitles were at times a little hard to follow. A few times I had to reread them to make sure I understood what was going on. Overall, I thought this was an excellent film, and I would highly recommend it.",
    " Based on true events, Argo is the nail-biting account of the life-and-death covert operation to rescue six Americans from Tehran during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. The plan: to pretend that they are part of a fictitious Canadian film crew seeking to make a movie in Iran. The ruse works long enough for them to get out of the country, but it leaves behind a frightened, confused and vulnerable woman, whose suspicious behavior leads Iranian authorities to uncover the truth.collections.imdb.com/title/tt2395861/reviews?ref_=tt_urv",
    " This movie started off great… creepy, eerie, unsettling. However, the last quarter (or more) of the movie was so ridiculous that I was almost crawling out of my skin. I don't know if I was supposed to take the events at the end as straight horror, or if it was supposed to be comedic, but I didn't find it funny. It was just plain annoying… In fact, I found the entire movie somewhat annoying. Maybe it was just me. I liked the actress who played \"Mama\", and I thought the storyline was good - until the very end. The filming was well done, and the sound, music, and effects were also good. I could have done without all the stupid \"found footage\" sequences, however. They didn't add anything to the movie, in my opinion, and were extremely annoying.",
    " While it will never reach the stratospheric highs of its predecessor, Monsters University is a nevertheless delightful, humourous and heartfelt continuation of the Monsters Inc. story. Setting the film in the earlier days of Mike and Sully's friendship sheds some much needed light on the origins of two of Pixar's most beloved characters, and offers a strong excuse to reprise the antics of the original. There are some slight structural issues and a weak subplot, but the humour and heart of Monsters Inc. have returned in full force. Whereas that film emphasised the relationship between the two monsters, this prequel is just as concerned with their individual character development. This works wonders for the film, because it allows each new scenario to serve as a learning experience for our two heroes. The lack of similarity between the two films is actually to Monsters University's benefit, preventing it from being labelled as a mere retread of the original.  \n\nThe story focuses on the relationship between Monsters Inc. stars Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan in their college years at Monsters University. The two, who start off as rivals, must team up in an effort to win the annual Scare Games and earn their place as scarers at Monsters Inc. Overall, Monsters University is another winner from Pixar, offering plenty of humour and heart that is sure to please both children and adults alike.",
    " IMAX's version of \"Gone With the Wind\" is exciting, and a great way to preserve a treasured film's legacy, but you'd best have plenty of time (3 hours and 39 minutes, to be exact) and a strong bladder to fully appreciate this magnificent cinematic experience.\n\nAssuming you do, what you'll see is a 70mm print of the revised version of the film transferred to digital, with several scenes that were previously cropped to allow for the 1.43:1 aspect ratio IMAX favours.\n\nIs it worth the price of admission? For fans of the film who have never seen it on a big screen, absolutely, but you'd best come armed with prior knowledge of the film's plot, or else you'll be quickly overwhelmed by the pace, and unsure of why anyone would choose to preserve such a seemingly racist and ideologically flawed narrative.\n\nGone With the Wind (1939) is a seminal moment in the history of American cinema, an epic adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel of the same name that firmly established producer David O. Selznick's reputation as a maker of grand, star-crossed romantic dramas, and typically revolves around its central performance by Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, a strong-willed, sexually-charged southern belle who's determined to survive, and even thrive, during the American Civil War.\n\nO'Hara is a controversial character, particularly for a feminist perspective, as she evolves from a selfish, ego-driven woman whose principal motivation is preserving her way of life, to a stoic, one-dimensional figure who's slowly hardened by war, and determined to reclaim her lost love, even if it means losing any trace of her femininity.\n\nThis transition is borne out of a sexist double-standard, as the film excuses her actions as being driven by \"magnolia\" pride, but any man who behaved in a similar fashion would be roundly dismissed as being weak, and in desperate need of rehabilitation.\n\nDespite this significant flaw, the film is an impressive piece of entertainment, featuring spectacular set pieces, a stellar cast, and one of the most expensive productions of its time, and for decades has been preserved as an invaluable artifact of a bygone era of Hollywood filmmaking.\n\nAs such, it's great to see it presented so lovingly by The Film Foundation and IMAX, and for audiences who appreciate cinema as a historical document, this is essential viewing.\n\nHowever, beyond the impressive scope and undeniable craft",
    " A tough-minded, wildly original mom who happens to be a brilliant inventor gets a chance to chase her dreams. An instant holiday classic that lights up the season with an uplifting tale of family togetherness and invention. A great performance by Jennifer Lawrence with strong support from Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper. A lot of fun and immensely entertaining. This film also features some tough subjects such as divorce, poverty, blended families, and more, but does it in a way that is inspiring and not at all depressing. A great film for the whole family.",

    " This is not only one of the greatest movies ever made, but one that is arguably the most influential. It's hard to turn on a TV or go to the movies today and not see something that was inspired by Casablanca - from the dramatic lighting, to the stories of ordinary people caught in the crosscurrents of history, to the idea that true love can still prevail, no matter how tough the circumstances. Of course, none of this would matter if the actors didn't bring the script to life. Ingrid Bergman gives one of the most compelling performances in movie history. Humphrey Bogart is at his hard-boiled best, and even turns in a few lighter moments as well. And despite the fact that everyone knows the famous lines ahead of time, they still deliver the punch as if they were brand new. If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you're doing, and watch it now!",
    " I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time. Captain America: The First Avenger pays homage to the Captain America comics of the 1940s, and serves as a perfect origin story to get us ready for Captain America: The Avengers next summer. It's also an origin story for the Marvel Cinematic Universe itself: we learn how Agent Peggy Carter got her start with S.H.I.E.L.D., and how Steve Rogers became Captain America, but along the way, we get introduced to Dr. Abraham Erskine, Howard Stark, Agent Phil Coulson--and Thor's hammer!--all of which put a big smile on my face. And William Hurt excels as the Nazi villain, while Stanley Tucci is a hoot as Dr. Erskine. This is a retro superhero movie, and I mean that in the best possible way. It's thrilling, funny, and captivating, and Anthony Mackie is a terrific scene-stealer as the winged fighter known as the Falcon. Can't wait to see this again before 2011 comes to a close.",
    " A superb script and a great ensemble cast add up to 10 stars. This movie solidifies Tarantino's reputation as one of our greatest directors ever; working mostly with a strong script, as compared to his other films that were heavier on the flash and glamour of filmmaking, this film is all about the dialogue and the characters, and boy does it ever deliver. This film approaches Shakespearean levels of dialogue in a good way. Every character is so well written and so deeply flawed, and the way the characters interact with each other is a joy to watch. There isn't a single false note in the entire cast's performances, and the film is just as funny as it is harrowing and thrilling. Go into this one as cold as possible, and I have no doubt you'll enjoy it. Rarely does a film live up to the hype as well as this one does.",
    " This is probably the best \"cops & robbers\" type movie that I have ever seen. It has a complex but engaging story, intelligently written and thoughtfully acted by a cast of first rate character actors. The plot is complicated, and involves many twists and turns, so pay attention or you may get lost. It is also a very brutal and realistic portrayal of crime and police work, so this is not a \"feel good\" movie, but it is not depressing either. If you enjoy thinking about a movie after you finish watching it, this is the movie for you.\n\nThe story is essentially a cat-and-mouse game, with DeNiro as the \"cat\" and Al Pacino as the \"mouse,\" and the scenes in which they \"play\" are the best of the movie. These two actors are a study in contrasts, and their scenes together are fascinating to watch. DeNiro is the \"professional\" criminal, while Pacino is the \"blue collar\" cop, and the difference in their styles is the main theme of the story. Pacino uses brute force and his street smarts to try to track down DeNiro and his crew, while DeNiro uses planning and finesse to try to stay one step ahead of the law.\n\nThe supporting performances are also outstanding, especially from Val Kilmer as a \"professional\" criminal who is trying to go straight, but gets drawn into one last job. The scene in which he and his wife are having dinner with DeNiro and his crew, and DeNiro tries to convince Kilmer to do \"one last job\" is classic.\n\nThis is a long movie, but it is not boring or slow moving for a second. The action scenes are well done and exciting, and the story keeps you involved and interested from beginning to end. This is a \"thinking man's\" action movie, and is an outstanding addition to the genre.",
    " This is it. The mother of all jidai geki. The film that summed up Mizoguchi's recurrent themes (and preoccupations), and also the apex of his achievement, of his trilogy revolving around women (the other two being \"Ugetsu\" and \"Sansho Dayu\"). And quite possibly the greatest film ever made.\n\n\"Ran\" depicts the tragedy of a noble family's decline, when the beloved son of a warrior decides to betray his father and marry a lower-class woman, and the consequences of this act of betrayal. The father loses his mind, and becomes a cruel and vicious ruler, who sees treachery and betrayal everywhere. He is willing to sacrifice his granddaughter for the sake of his honor, willing to commit murder and massacre to avenge the death of his favorite son. And yet, the film does not judge him. It acknowledges the tragedy and the pathos of his situation, as a ruler whose megalomania and obsession with loyalty and honor have brought doom upon his family and his people. And it is this very pathos that ultimately generates the incredible sadness and power of \"Ran\".\n\nThis is the film where Mizoguchi's recurrent visual and formal preoccupations reach their climax. The use of landscape and space, the circular and recursive movements, the importance of sight and visibility, the off-center framing, the chiaroscuro, the use of mist and rain as emotional sublimation… Everything is pushed to the maximum here, with incredible results. This is also the film where Mizoguchi's typically Japanese approach to narrative reaches its apex. There is something incredibly distinctive in the way Mizoguchi tells his story, in the way he chooses to linger on faces and landscapes, in the way he is not afraid to pause, to take his time, to have his characters walk, to move in circles, to repeat actions… This is not a filmmaker who wants to excite or move his audience with the thrills of action or the rapidity of editing. On the contrary, he wants to immerse them into his narrative, to involve them, to make them identify with his characters, to experience their emotions and feelings, to live with them.\n\nThis involves incredible acting. Despite being nearly 40 years old when he directed \"Ran\", Mizoguchi had an incredible talent for working with actors, and this is evident in the incredible, nuanced, and deeply moving performances he was able to extract from his cast.

    " The Simpsons Movie is a comedy that stretches the limits of plausibility to the breaking point and beyond. Homer Simpson (Dan Castellaneta) is summoned to Springfield Museum, where he discovers that the ancient Egyptian mummy of Prince Nebra (Oded Fehr) has been stolen. The culprit is a mysterious volcano that erupted and poured its hot lava all over the museum, destroying it and allowing the thief to escape. Captain Wackner (Thomas Kretschmann) lays the blame on Homer and promptly fires him. Homer returns home to find his wife Marge (Julie Kavner) in a state over the condition of their house. Homer is oblivious to her concerns and prefers to watch TV, so to teach him a lesson, Marge hides the remote control. Homer inexplicably climbs onto the roof to contemplate his life, only to fall through it and into the basement. There he discovers a hole in the basement wall and decides to investigate its origins, despite Marge's protests. He travels through the hole and into Springfield's sewer system, where he meets up with his friends Bart (Nancy Cartwright), Lenny (Harry Shearer), and Carl (Hank Azaria). Together, they decide to explore the sewer system further, only to discover that it leads directly to the power plant. There, they come face to face with the plant's owner, Mr. Burns (Harry Shearer), who's planning to flood Springfield with toxic sludge in order to claim the insurance money and build a new plant. Burns captures Homer's friends and holds them hostage, but Homer manages to escape back to the surface. Upon arriving home, Homer discovers that Marge has filed for divorce. He rushes to the elementary school where Bart and Lisa (Yeardley Smith) are being babysat by Principal Skinner (Harry Shearer) and begins to lament his loss of his family. Hearing this, Bart and Lisa encourage him to save his friends and reunite his family. He returns to the hole in the basement and follows the sewer system to the power plant. There, with the help of his pet rat, Snowball, he rescues his friends and defeats Mr. Burns. Upon returning home, Homer finds Marge on the roof of their house, preparing to jump off. He talks her out of it and the two reconcile. The movie ends with the family together again, watching The Happy Little Elves, a cartoon that Homer, Bart, and Lisa all enjoy.\n\nIf the concept of a feature-length Simpsons movie intimidates you, you're not alone.",
    " The movie 'Angels & Demons' is a revolutionary film, in that it takes the bold step of attempting to delve into the human mind, rather than the supernatural one and this affords it a much more realistic approach than most films of this genre. By realistically, I mean that it takes its subject matter seriously and doesn't rely on cheap 'scare' tactics that other films of this type rely on. It also has a much more cerebral approach to the story, which is more akin to 'The Da Vinci Code' rather than the book, on which it is based.\n\nThe story revolves around the discovery of a mystical code, that points to the next pope, and evidence of a secret society called 'The Illuminati', that has been secretly controlling the Vatican for centuries and the subsequent 18 hour battle, to prevent 4 kidnapped Cardinals, from being murdered, prior to the conclave.\n\nWith an all star cast, including; Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard & Pierfrancesco Favino, directed by the legendary Ron Howard, this movie, had the makings of a sure fire winner & it manages to achieve this status, by taking itself seriously, which produces in the viewer, a willingness to do the same.\n\nThe storyline, although controversial, is a reasonably easy watch & manages to explain itself reasonably well, without leaving the viewer feeling as though they've missed something, which cannot be said for its predecessor 'The Da Vinci Code'. The cinematography is faultless & the scenery is breathtaking, having been filmed on location, in and around the Vatican, which gives a sense of realism to the story, not often seen.\n\nIn conclusion, this film is a welcome addition to any DVD collection, although I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of 15, due to its subject matter. However, for anyone who likes their conspiracy theories, this is right up there with the best of them.",

The story was very unique and I enjoyed the film's creativity. The acting was great as well, with stars like Elizabeth Olsen and Julianne Moore. I think that this movie definitely deserved the 84/100 rating that it has on IMDb. It was a great movie and I would definitely recommend it to others.",
    " While a bit on the long side, and a little too condensed in spots, this is a technically superb film, and Matt Damon gives another great performance. It's also refreshing to have a hero who is smart, competent, and who treats everyone around him with respect, even his arch-nemesis. Some of the supporting performances are a bit one-note, but there's not a single bad performance in the bunch. This is definitely one of the better films of the year.\n\nThe Martian tells the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded on Mars after a disastrous storm hits his crew's base. Watney is presumed dead by his crewmates, but he survives and finds himself stranded on the hostile planet with only meager supplies, and must find a way to survive until a rescue mission can reach him. The film follows Watney as he adapts to his new surroundings, and eventually finds a way to contact Earth and plead for help.\n\nThe film is a technical marvel, and the visuals are stunning. The cinematography is also top-notch, and the film's score is a great addition to the overall experience. The film's only real downside is its length; at nearly two and a half hours, it feels a bit too long in spots. Additionally, some of the supporting characters are a bit underdeveloped, and their relationships with Watney feel a bit forced.\n\nOverall, The Martian is a great film, and a welcome change of pace from the typical summer blockbusters. It's a smart, well-made film, with a great performance from Matt Damon, and some stunning visuals. While it could have used a bit more polish in spots, it's still one of the better films of the year, and well worth checking out.",
    " While it necessarily takes some creative license with the facts, \"The Finest Hours\" is a rousing action thriller which benefits from a tense scenario and excellent special effects. While the story slows down every now and then, overall this is a fast-paced and very watchable film thanks to strong work from Chris Pine and an unpredictable third act. \n\nThe film is based on the true story of Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), who takes charge of a daring rescue mission to save the crew of the SS Pendleton, which has split in half and sunk in 90 feet of water. With a howling blizzard threatening to blow his small rescue boat off course, Bernie and his three man crew set sail to try and reach the sinking ship before its too late. Meanwhile, the Coast Guard has also dispatched a cutter to help, but it has suffered an mechanical failure and is dead in the water. It's up to Bernie to save the day, and he might not get back in time to save his own marriage in the process. \n\n\"The Finest Hours\" is a fairly by-the-numbers action/thriller, but it's a very well made and extremely watchable example of the genre. The story draws from real-life events which are unusual and dramatic enough on their own, and the filmmakers don't shy away from fleshing them out and adding plenty of action and suspense. Bernie's journey to rescue the sinking ship is given just as much attention (if not more) as the Coast Guard's efforts to get their large cutter working again. There's always something at stake, and just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. The third act in particular stands out for its many twists and turns, and excellent use of simultaneous action sequences. \n\nChris Pine delivers one of his best performances yet as the stalwart and determined Bernie, giving the character a relatable everyman quality that makes you root for him from the start. He has excellent chemistry with Ben Foster, who almost steals the movie as the confident and teasing coxswain Richard. The two have great banter and a nice brotherly relationship which forms the heart of the movie. Thankfully, Bernie's personal life and the obstacles he faces are just as well developed as the rescue mission, giving the movie a good balance between action and character driven drama. \n\nThe effects and cinematography are excellent, and there are some truly awe-inspiring shots of the rescue boats cutting through the giant waves. The blizzard is also used to great effect, constantly threatening",

He makes you feel for him with his awkwardness and insecurities, and yet he is so charming and sweet. Rose Byrne is also great as the girl of his dreams. She is beautiful and yet so real and down-to-earth. This movie is just so much fun to watch. The 40-Year-Old Virgin is hilarious, sweet, and just an all-around great movie. Carell and Byrne are brilliant together. Highly recommended!",
    " The sex scene toward the end between Donald and a nearly unrecognizable Matt Bomer as an extremely buff version of Ken is worth the price of admission all by itself. But, in fact, the entire movie is a delight, and a worthy successor to the first film. What was essentially a one-joke movie (with a great soundtrack) is now a much more fleshed out (no pun intended) romantic comedy with a message even if it is a bit heavy-handed at times. And the soundtrack is every bit as amazing as you would expect from a Magic Mike movie. All the main players from the first film are back, and the addition of Donald and a surprisingly good Andie MacDowell only add to the fun. This is easily the best romantic comedy of the year so far.\n\nIf you're wondering if you should see Magic Mike XXL in the theater or wait for DVD, see it in the theater. It's worth the price. I didn't think the first film warranted a 3D upgrade, but this one did. It's bright, colorful, and the 3D effects are actually worth the price of admission (and I don't say that about many movies). I don't want to give too much away, but there is a sequence at the end during the big dance number that is just hilarious, and it has to be seen in 3D. I don't want to give it away, but suffice it to say that what you think is going to happen at the end...doesn't.",
    " The movie follows soldier ant Zach (voiced by Woody Allen), who's fed up with his same old, dull life in the colony. When he meets the princess of an alien colony, he sees it as his chance to break out of his rut and start over. The voice cast also features Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, and Gene Hackman as Zach's best friend. The animation is top-notch, and the story is both funny and heartfelt. However, the movie's message about the importance of following your dreams is a bit on the nose. Overall, \"Antz\" is a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy. ",

    " A sports drama centered on cross-country running, McFarland, USA is a formula film executed exceptionally well, thanks to the veteran director and the unbelievable true story that it's based on. While sports movies usually focus on well-known cities with affluent communities, this one focuses on a predominantly Latino high school from a small, economically challenged town. It is much more interesting and emotionally rewarding because of that fact.\n\nThe film is about a high school that is in danger of losing its football program due to funding. Tracy Yoach (who also wrote the film) plays James White, a new P.E. teacher who is introduced to the Hispanic culture of the town and decides to use this culture as part of an after-school program. Juan Pablo Paulino plays Thomas Valles, the fastest runner in the school who, despite his athletic ability, is reluctant to be a part of the new cross-country team.\n\nWhite sees something in Valles and encourages him to not waste his God-given talent. Valles is slowed by family responsibilities that require him to prioritize his time, and White convinces him that running can be a way for him to escape the struggles he faces at home. The result is a fantastic story of how White and Valles rally the entire town to support the team, which goes on to have state-wide success and helps the school avoid shutting down.\n\nDirector Kevin Reynolds is a veteran filmmaker whose career seems to be based on sports movies, with credits including Risen, Sahara, and Glory. This is easily his best effort, mostly because it feels so authentic and homegrown. The screenplay is a little predictable, but still effective, and the story is positively inspirational. The real Thomas Valles, cross-country coach Jim White, and most of the other people portrayed in the film attended the screening I saw, and their presence made the experience even more rewarding.\n\nMcFarland, USA is a rare sports drama that really is based on the incredible accomplishments of a group of real people who overcame tremendous odds to achieve success. It's a film based on true equality, faith, and perseverance that deserves to be seen by a wide audience.",
    " A funny, poignant, and ultimately uplifting story about a family's struggles, and how they cope with them. The movie is a little biased to the father and his wishes, but that's what makes it so interesting: it shows how each of the family members is affected by his obsession, and how they deal with it in their own ways. The ending is a bit predictable, but that's okay because the journey getting there is what matters.\n\nThe acting is top-notch, and the characters are well-developed and relatable. The script is also well-written, and the dialogue is often hilarious. The direction is also excellent, and the movie is well-paced and never boring.\n\nA great movie for a family to watch together, or for anyone who enjoys a good comedy with a touch of drama. Highly recommended!",

    " Waterford began as a small collection of rural hamlets in the late Viking Age (c. 914–1014 CE). Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169–71, the island was divided into lordships and Waterford became the principal port of the south of Ireland. Following the enactment of the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367, Waterford remained a lordship until it was incorporated as a royal city under Henry VIII in 1540. Following the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Ireland came under English rule and Waterford remained a city, though it was now regarded as only the \"second city\" of the island. Following the Acts of Union in 1800, Waterford became the second largest city, behind Dublin, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nEarly in the 1170s, Norman nobles strengthened the natural defences of the river valley and built the first castle. The first charter was granted by King John in 1205. The fortified town developed as the main port of call for imports to Ireland from Europe. Wine, spices and textiles were traded for wool, hides and salmon. By the late 13th century, Waterford had become an important centre of trade with England and Continental Europe. The city was managed by a corporation of merchants who oversaw the port's development. Shipbuilding and exporting Irish wool to Europe began in the 14th century.\n\nDuring the Reformation, Waterford remained a Catholic city. However, Bishop Richard Rawson was appointed as the Church of Ireland's bishop of Waterford by King Henry VIII. Rawson compliantly abandoned Catholicism and began the process of converting the city. In the resulting religious strife, Rawson was murdered in 1535. The Corporation of Merchants, who governed the city, defended Rawson's murder by claiming that he had been killed \"for his evil and treacherous deeds\".\n\nIn the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the city was seized by Confederate Catholics, however, it was regained by English Parliamentarian forces under the command of Oliver Cromwell in 1649. The city was later occupied by the French under the command of Lauzun in 1658. Following the Act of Settlement in 1662, Waterford and other Irish ports were declared closed to foreign vessels. However, this was repealed in 1669 and foreign trade resumed.\n\nFollowing the Acts of Union in 1800, the city became part of the United Kingdom. It was granted a royal charter in 1802. In the 19th century, Waterford became the largest ship-building port in Ireland. The city's first newspaper, the Waterford Mail, began publication",

    " Hero envy is a structural bias that favors heroic personalities in individualist cultures, according to cultural anthropologist Joseph Campbell. It is a type of envy typically drawn towards those seen as better versions of oneself and is often attributed to comparisons of skill or ability among peers. Campbell claims that hero envy is the desire for the exciting, risky, and glamorous life of the hero, and that it is a major driver of human culture. Campbell's concept of hero envy is discussed in the psychological literature on envy, which cites it as an important concept for understanding the emotion.\n\nHeroism tends to be culturally defined, and heroes may be real or mythical figures. Some heroes become celebrities. Not all heroes are saints, and some heroes may be considered villains. In fact, some villains are themselves envious of the heroes who defeat them, and derive some perverse satisfaction from being able to point out the hero's flaws and vulnerabilities. This distinguishes villainy from heroism, in that villains take a permissive attitude while heroes take a proactive one.\n\nThe term \"hero\" can also refer to superheroes, which are usually fictional characters that have superpowers and use them for good. These characters are often portrayed as being very brave and strong, and they often have a strong sense of justice and morality. It is not uncommon for people to envy superheroes, as they represent the ultimate in power and strength.\n\nEnvy is an emotion that can motivate people to improve themselves and achieve their goals. However, it can also lead to negative feelings and behaviors, such as resentment, jealousy, and spite. It is important to recognize and manage feelings of envy in order to live a happy and fulfilling life.",

    " Club de Berne is a colloquial term used to refer to a group of southern African countries that share a common currency and a common financial and monetary policy. The term was coined by the Swiss journalist Jean Ziegler in his book _La rupture du tabac_ in 1976, in which he suggested that Switzerland should follow the example of the \"Club de Berne\" and adopt a currency union with neighboring countries. Although the term is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the \"Berne Club\", it is not an organization and therefore has no membership, charter, leadership, or meetings.\n\nThe term \"Club de Berne\" refers to these nine countries which may be considered to be a currency bloc:\n\n- Botswana\n- Lesotho\n- Namibia\n- South Africa\n- Swaziland\n- Tanzania (1964-1966)\n- Zambia (1964-1966)\n\nThese countries had been inserted into the CFA franc monetary system upon independence.

    " \"Wrangler\" and \"Cowboy\" are terms used by the U.S. military in Hawaii to describe their insecticides and ACBs (insect growth regulators) against the caterpillars of the invasive alien moth, the brown tree snake, and the mosquito. \"Wrangler\" is also the term used by Arcata and Eureka, California for their integrated pest management (IPM) programs for the same insect. \"Cowboy\" is the term used by many other urban areas for their insecticides applied against the moth.\n\nThe term \"moth wrangler\" has been used to describe those involved with controlling the brown tree snake in Hawaii. It is also used by those who produce and spread the pheromone of the male brown tree snake as a means of population control. This is a widely used technique because the female brown tree snake only mates once, and if no male pheromone is detected, she will not mate. Male brown tree snakes are harmless to people; they are captured, chilled, and sent to a laboratory where their skins are removed and the pheromone is extracted. The pheromone is then put into \"snake balls\" which are spread around urban areas, attracting male snakes which then collide with the ball and die. The purpose of the balls is to reduce the population by making the males infertile.\n\nThe only major species of moth which is a pest in Hawaii is the brown tree snake. It was introduced into the islands around 1965, and rapidly became a major pest, killing almost all birds in the forests and urban areas. It is a major reason that Hawaii has no endemic birds, and many species of birds have been introduced to control the snake. The snake has also been seen on the U.S. mainland.\"",

Despite this, the military traditions of the Sammarinese people can be traced back to the Middle Ages, being reinforced during the Republic's military engagements in the Italian mainland during the Renaissance.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, the primary objective of the Sammarinese military has been the preservation of the independence and freedom of the Republic of San Marino. This has traditionally been achieved through a combination of diplomatic immunity and military defense. The military has also played a key role in the protection of the Republic's borders and the maintenance of public order.\n\nToday, the Sammarinese Armed Forces consist of a small volunteer army and a ceremonial guard. These forces are tasked with continuing the traditional defensive and security roles of the military, as well as participating in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.\n\nThe army is composed of a headquarters unit, three infantry companies, a logistical unit and a pedagogical unit. The army is equipped with light weapons and mortars. It does not possess any heavy weapons or tanks. The logistical unit is responsible for the maintenance and repair of military equipment and facilities. The pedagogical unit provides training and education to army personnel.\n\nIn addition to the army, the Sammarinese Armed Forces also include a ceremonial guard, which is responsible for the security and protection of the Republic's governmental figures and institutions. The ceremonial guard is composed of a headquarters unit, two ceremonial units and a logistical unit. The ceremonial units are responsible for the organization and implementation of ceremonies and events, as well as the security and protection of governmental figures and institutions. The logistical unit is responsible for the maintenance and repair of ceremonial equipment and facilities.\n\nThe Sammarinese Armed Forces are equipped with a variety of light weapons and mortars. These weapons are primarily used for defensive purposes, as the military is not intended to engage in offensive operations. In addition to these weapons, the military also has a small number of heavier weapons, such as howitzers and anti-tank weapons. These weapons are primarily used for strategic purposes, such as the defense of the Republic's borders and the protection of its citizens.\n\nThe Sammarinese Armed Forces have a long and proud history, which dates back to the Middle Ages. During this time, the military played a key role in the defense and independence of the Republic of",

    " The Kitayatsu Site is an archaeological site in Japan, located in Hakui City, Ishikawa Prefecture. The site is the remains of a large-scale settlement from the early Jōmon period (4000–2500 BCE). It is the largest early Jōmon period settlement ever found in Japan. The site was discovered in 2003 when the owner of the land, who had been farming the area for many years, found some archaeological artifacts while working in the fields. The site was excavated by the prefectural board of education in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe remains of more than 250 pit dwellings and other features, including a possible burial ground and several large storage pits, were found at the site. The storage pits were found to contain a variety of artifacts, including Jōmon pottery, stone tools, and bone tools. Many of the artifacts were found to be charred, suggesting that the settlement was destroyed by fire. A large number of artifacts, including many that were charred, were also found outside the settlement, suggesting that the fire was widespread and destroyed much of the settlement and its contents.\n\nThe site is significant because it provides a rare example of a large-scale settlement from the early Jōmon period. Most other settlements from this period are small, temporary camps that were used for a short period of time and then abandoned. The Kitayatsu Site is also significant because it appears to have been destroyed by fire, which provides a rare opportunity to study the effects of fire on a Jōmon period settlement. The site is currently being preserved and managed as a historic site by the Hakui City Board of Education.",

    " Turks in the United Kingdom and British people in Turkey are people with Turkish or British nationality living in Turkey and the United Kingdom respectively.\n\nBritish people in Turkey form one of the largest European populations in Turkey. There are estimated to be around 5,000 British citizens in Turkey. Most are retired people who have moved to Turkey to live out their retirement. There is also a large number of British people who own holiday homes in Turkey, particularly in the Aegean region and Istanbul. Due to its mild Mediterranean climate and laid-back lifestyle, many Britons have also chosen to relocate to Turkey's Aegean coast, particularly to the towns of Fethiye, Ölüdeniz, and Hisarönü, which has in turn created a large community of British people in those towns. Turks in the UK are a significant modern minority in the country, with Turkey being among the top countries of birth for the UK.\n\nStarting in the 1960s, Turkey made a significant effort to hire Turkish professionals in the UK. Initially, these were university graduates who arrived in the UK for educational purposes, particularly in the fields of medicine, engineering, and architecture. Many of these early immigrants settled in the UK and started families. More recently, significant numbers of Turkish people have come to the UK as refugees, seeking asylum from the Kurdish–Turkish conflict, or for economic reasons. According to the 2001 UK census, 71,603 Turkish nationals were living in the UK at the time, making them the largest Muslim ethnic group in the country. However, the Office for National Statistics estimated that the number of Turkish nationals living in the UK in 2013 was 178,000, making them the fifth-largest foreign born population in the country. This figure has been increasing rapidly since the 1990s, partly due to the accession of Turkey to the European Union, an event which has led to a streamlining of the application process for Work and Residence Permits for Turkish people wishing to migrate to the UK. Turks are more concentrated in England than in the other countries of the UK. According to the 2011 census, 138,371 Turks live in England and 21,056 in Scotland, while Wales and Northern Ireland have smaller Turkish communities. Turks form the largest Muslim ethnic group in England and Scotland.\n\nTurkey is one of the most popular tourist destinations for Britons, with over half a million British tourists visiting Turkey every year.

When English captain John Hoar asked him why he was fighting, Wanalancet replied, \"My Indians say, they have been hunting and getting their living quietly; if they be disturbed, they must defend themselves.\"\n\nIn 1676, Hoar convinced Wanalancet to attend a peace conference in Plymouth, but he arrived late, and when he heard that the Christian Indians were to be given two months to leave their homeland, he flew into a rage, yelling that the English had tricked him. The conference ended without a peace agreement.\n\nWanalancet died in 1684.",

    " Head-on engagement refers to the situation in which two aircraft, often aircraft of similar characteristics, are flying towards each other in opposite directions, intending to collide. The situation usually occurs in air-to-air combat, and the aircraft involved may be armed with air-to-air missiles or guns.\n\nA head-on engagement can be a dangerous and unpredictable situation for both pilots. In the vast majority of cases, both aircraft will pass each other without incident, but in some cases, a collision may occur. This can be the result of a misjudgment of distance or speed, a malfunction of one of the aircraft's systems, or a deliberate action on the part of one of the pilots.\n\nIn the context of air-to-air combat, a head-on engagement can be a strategic move on the part of one of the pilots, as it can allow them to take advantage of their opponent's blind spot and fire on them without being seen. However, it can also be a risky move, as it can leave the pilot vulnerable to attack from behind. It's important for pilots to be aware of the risks and take appropriate measures to avoid a collision during a head-on engagement.",

    " Deferred inspection is the process whereby the United States Customs and Border Protection service defers the inspection of a train, ship, or truck to a later time, often by attaching a tag to the vehicle indicating that inspection will be required at a port of entry at a later time. This is useful for the CBP because it allows them to prioritize inspections, and it is also beneficial for carriers because it saves time. However, this process may also be exploited by drug smugglers, who may use the tags to transport illegal goods without inspection. In these cases, the CBP will typically either intercept the vehicle at the port of entry or the vehicle will arrive at its destination and the smugglers will disperse. Interdiction policies which target alternative ports of entry upon arrival, or secondary inspection stations at the port of entry, are meant to combat these tactics.",

    " In poetry, a transcript is a poem that is created by copying words verbatim from another source. The source can be any text at all, but it is usually a nonliterary text such as a legal document, a technical manual, or a dictionary. \n\nThe result is usually humorous, and if the source is well-chosen, it can make a point about language, and how meaning and understanding are created. It is a genre of found poetry.\n\nSome poets who have used the transcriptive technique include Carl Sandburg, Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, and Joel Oppenheimer. In Oppenheimer's case, transcripts of weather reports have inspired many of his poems. The tradition of transcriptive poetry can also be traced back to Taoist philosophy of the 6th century BCE, which believed that \"proper speech\" should be spontaneous and unpremeditated."
